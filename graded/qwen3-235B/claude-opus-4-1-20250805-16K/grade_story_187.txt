<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strengths in Mara's clear motivation and alignment of her stoic, archival nature with actions, but underdeveloped secondary characters limit depth. The "brash tenderness" voice is unevenly executed, occasionally veering into didacticism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates efficient use of tight constraints with a clear arc, but the raven’s sudden speech and apprentices’ instantaneous change feel underdeveloped. Pacing balances momentum and detail effectively despite minor rushed resolutions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting's stark, ritualistic atmosphere is vivid through sensory details like glowing runes and cawing ravens. The "brash tenderness" tone is subtly conveyed through Mara’s interactions, though the abandoned cabin’s connection to the training ground lacks deeper environmental cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance around power and partnership, enhanced by symbolic use of the floorboard. Subtext about historical erasure elevates the narrative, though some emotional beats rely on direct exposition rather than pure subtextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic fantasy tropes by reimagining familiars as equals, but phrases like “burns twice as bright” border on cliché. Emotional stakes are visceral but occasionally undermined by over-explanation rather than fully trusting the imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a clear theme, but the word count compresses character growth and worldbuilding into surface-level execution. The story’s brevity serves its immediacy but sacrifices deeper exploration of philosophical implications.</comment>
