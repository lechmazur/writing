<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations (choosing personal battles over pacifism) are clear and consistent, but deeper psychological nuances are occasionally underdeveloped. Voice remains distinct through detached, militaristic observation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action (surveillance) drives the plot effectively, with logical cause-effect in cataloguing visitors. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in connecting Marcus' backstory to present events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral storm imagery, exposed tree roots, and cider-scented "poisoned pleasantries" create an oppressive, memorable atmosphere. Sensory details serve both setting and thematic malice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "spider documenting flies" add depth. Subtext about predatory tradition resonates beyond surface plot. Conflict (observation vs. predation) resolves with chilling implication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through morally ambiguous character framing. Subverts "neighborhood watch" expectations. Writing is crisp yet evocative, with emotionally resonant subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant cohesion between family tradition, surveillance, and predation. The brief length enhances tension. Leaves lingering unease about complicity in tradition.</comment>
