<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Martha's motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; her cynically gentle nature is compelling but lacks emotional texture, relying heavily on juxtaposition rather than organic character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has momentum but feels compressed; the time machine's inclusion destabilizes cause/effect logic, and the climactic "exceeding limitations" lacks pay-off specificity within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (lavender stains, bread smells), but the hybrid time machine/bakery setting muddies the mystical-reality balance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery (truth-spores, empathy-as-contagion) is striking and layered, with subtext about soft power challenging tyranny; weakened slightly by overly literal metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with inventive combinations, but the time-harvesting technique and shadow dialogue verge on narrative convenience, betraying occasional formulaic structuring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Exhibits creative ambition and thematic cohesion, though some elements (time machine) feel tacked-on rather than organic to its concise scope.</grade>
