<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Insufficient exploration of Marcus' internal conflict beyond surface-level rebellion; motivations shift abruptly without psychological nuance. Interactions with the flower lack emotional depth, though the concept of inherited identity through the origami has potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pacing strains coherence in transitioning between laundromat and mystical study; the central arc collapses too quickly from revelation to resolution. The estrangement theme drives structural contrasts but feels underdeveloped within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (e.g., "dryer door expanding into a chamber") anchors the surreal elements, but atmospheric details like "impossible fabrics" remain conceptually vague rather than viscerally tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like the flower’s "spores of light" resonate, but heavier reliance on thematic statements ("true rebellion meant accepting his role") weakens emotional impact. The haunting tone is unevenly sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-pattern clichés but shows traces of abstract generalization ("constellations from desk drawers") over specific, grounded details. The "ancient flower" symbolism and "scattered minds" concept offer freshness but risk overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts ambitious thematic synthesis but struggles to fully harmonize elements; the laundromat's mundane/surreal duality feels conceptually underexploited. The ending is thematically resonant but narratively thin.</comment>
