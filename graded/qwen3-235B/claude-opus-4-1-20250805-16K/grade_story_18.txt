<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minerva’s curse as a telepathic statue creates compelling tension between her immobility and mental acuity, but her internal passivity risks diluting agency. The hair tie’s emotional weight is clear, though the daughter’s sudden awakening lacks subtle psychological groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Economical yet cohesive arc bridges Minerva’s decades of suffering to the climactic truth-revelation. The compressed word count occasionally strains temporal transitions (e.g., sudden daughter’s recognition), but the cyclical return to the snapped hair tie ties the narrative together beautifully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steam-powered details immerse readers in a tangible, morally corroded society—gears, copper-tasting lies, ink-shadowed walls. The setting isn’t just ornamental; it mirrors the corruption Minerva exposes. Sensory details are purposeful, not indulgent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful interplay of metaphor (ink/weatherizing as truth-preserving) and subtext (statuary as enforced silence vs. calligraphy as liberation). The ending avoids sentimentality—cracks in stone signify incremental justice, not fantasy-style deus ex machina. Subtly haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (no redemption of villains, no easy emancipation) but occasionally leans on steampunk’s expected grit. Prose is vivid yet precise, though “liquid shadow” ink veers toward familiar metaphor territory. Emotional resonance emerges through symbolic choices, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Every element serves dual purposes: the hair tie connects character history and plot, steam-powered decay mirrors thematic decay. The brevity sharpens the story’s moral focus, leaving lingering questions about truth’s enduring fragility even after victory.</comment>
