<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in using submissiveness as narrative device but underdevelops inner conflict; motivations feel overly reductive through "silent empathy" abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Well-concealed mechanics of frequency manipulation but compressed resolution feels unearned; emotional beats compete with technical exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids spy tropes through gardening subversion but contains occasional overwrought phrases like "resonance patterns like others understood words"; emotional nuance edges toward preciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration skilled though occasionally schematic; premise's conceit occasionally strains credulity despite strong thematic throughline about power through perceived weakness.</comment>
