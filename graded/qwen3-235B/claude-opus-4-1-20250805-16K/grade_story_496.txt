<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Marcus's psychological conflict is well-wrought but the antagonists/readers are archetypal. The perfume bottle reveals his vulnerability but motivation/voice could deepen.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a compressed arc from repression to catharsis, but the ambush resolution feels abrupt. The action-method connection (poetry as transformative tool) is imaginative, though pacing falters slightly in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”moss-carpeted cars and mutant ivy create visceral decay. Sensory details (jasmine, rustling vines) immerse readers in a coherent post-apocalyptic ecology that thematically mirrors Marcus's internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of words as both perfume and weapon resonates. Subtext about art's power/restraint is layered; the ending's quiet devastation ("devours everything it loves") crystallizes the theme while avoiding didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the literary-tattoo survivors and metaphor-as-magic system. Some overwrought phrases ("decades of repression cracking like concrete") verge on purple prose but don't undermine core creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. While some assigned prompts (timeframe) feel perfunctory, the perfume bottle and setting are masterfully integrated, and the story's thematic heft transcends its constraints.</comment>
