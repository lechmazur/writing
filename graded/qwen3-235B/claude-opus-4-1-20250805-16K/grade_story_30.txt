<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but underdeveloped; motivations (preserving knowledge, ancestral connection) are present but lack psychological depth. Dialogue reveals competence, not conflict. Telekinesis serves plot but not personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Economical three-act structure works within constraints. Flame-dice moment provides visceral payoff. Pacing strains under dense concept-delivery, with underdeveloped jumps between stakes and execution. Logical consistency maintained despite tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through tactile details (tapestry texture, dice light) and linguistic archaeology. Setting lacks full integration—space pirates operate in a generic "navigation room" without distinctive societal context. Sensory details lean on visual/pseudo-mystical rather than corporeal immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Linguistic encoding in textile and cyclical philosophy provide intellectual resonance. Prose balances lyrical restraint with urgency. Broadcast climax transcends "knowledge vs. power" trope through structural execution rather than thematic depth. Subtext about oral/cultural transmission is under-explicated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Combines hard-SF piracy with linguistic anthropology in fresh ways. Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "corporate villainy" subtext. Similes and metaphors (supernova light on tapestry) feel precise rather than ornamental. Some elements (bonsai trees) feel inserted rather than organic. Dialogues avoid exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively despite ambitious conceptual layering. Length works as urgent manifesto rather than limitation. Symbolism (dragons as farming schematics) elevates from genre mechanics to cultural commentary. Under-explored emotional beats limit lingering impact.</comment>
