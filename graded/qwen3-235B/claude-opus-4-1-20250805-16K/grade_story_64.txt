<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prominent inner conflict exists but lacks depth; motivations are clear but nuanced struggles remain underexplored; the dragon scale interaction shows restraint but feels underdeveloped thematically</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clever circular structure ties trial conclusion to opening uncertainty; pacing uneven during exposition dumps; sudden resolution lacks buildup despite clever twist; cause-effect logic strained by unexplained historical details</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Evocative initial imagery (floating marketplace) falters under underdeveloped physics; atmosphere leans too heavily on "mundane miracle" contradiction without resolving its paradox; setting details like balloon tethers remain disconnected from narrative stakes</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful existential theme resonates through elegant symbolic parallels (immortality-as-drift, promises-as-protection); emotionally charged ending elevates simplistic prose; metaphorical richness compensates for uneven technical execution</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding treads familiar fantasy tropes (dragon parts, coded floors) but execution avoids strict formula; immortality warning feels familiar yet gains freshness through grounded character choice; minimal "purple prose" but some overused descriptors ("centuries-old marble")</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story successfully functions as self-contained parable despite uneven pacing; thematic cohesion achieved through strong central metaphor; brevity works thematically but leaves setting and supporting elements underdeveloped; resonant final image elevates overall impact</comment>
