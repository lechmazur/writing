<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While Magnus's physicality as a bruiser contrasts well with his emotional motivation, deeper exploration of his psychology and how his violent past shaped his gentle mission remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot efficiently uses tight space to build from map discovery to revelation about the baton's true purpose, though some transitions between danger and emotional resolution feel rushed despite clear arc from motivation to transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like hungry snapping flytraps, steamed glass, and acidic maws effectively establish dangerous atmosphere, but deeper connection between greenhouse's botanical nature and theme of communication could be more explicitly developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story subverts typical "raise the dead" tropes by making baton a tool for translation rather than resurrection, though elements like carnivorous plant labyrinth feel somewhat conventional despite clever integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion despite complex elements, with musical theme providing elegant unifying force; brief length serves the sudden twist and emotional payoff effectively within limited word count.</comment>
