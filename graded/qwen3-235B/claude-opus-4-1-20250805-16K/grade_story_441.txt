<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's abandonment of shoes and ritual with stamps poignantly convey maternal loss and intellectual yearning. The flash mob interaction strains plausibility for connecting her to Elena, but emotional core remains cohesive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Flash mob device feels artificially imposed, disrupting organic flow between Marina's solitary ritual and Ana's entrance. Bus route timeframe creates effective time pressure, but collision-to-envelope scene skips emotional beats despite concise arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vibrant sensory details like vibrations through Marina's bare feet ground cosmic themes in physicality. "Curious dread" underdeveloped; CERN's scientific sterility contrasts memorably with tactile stamp imagery but fails to fully embody thematic disconnection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (colliding particles as failed human connections, stamps as desire-objects) create haunting resonance. Ending's philosophical revelation feels earned through accumulated symbolism, blending quantum physics and emotional entropy with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story avoids genre tropes through original conceits (lullaby in heartbreak's language), though flash mob risks whimsicality. Sensory details strong but occasionally overwrought ("velocity of return" stretches credibility despite thematic payoff).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements coalesce into haunting meditation on loss, but stamp's "no-longer-existing country" strains suspension of disbelief. Flash mob and non-existent nation threaten coherence, though core metaphor of physics-as-emotion remains compelling.</comment>
