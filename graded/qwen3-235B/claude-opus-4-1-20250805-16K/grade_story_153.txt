<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (understanding vs. mere immortality) is consistent but remains more intellectual than visceral; actions align with traits but emotional depth is intentionally muted rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot maintains internal logic, with the headlamp and journal-swapping driving the character's revelation; however, the constrained word limit flattens the arc's emotional weight despite a coherent beginning-to-end throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Absurdly rich sensory contrasts (entropy vs. impossible light, dark matter vs. human memory) create visceral dissonance; the atmosphere of cosmic futility leavened by defiant meaning-making is masterfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (light/consumed stars, journals as paradoxical texts) deepen themes; the ending's refusal to grant transcendence while affirming cyclical inquiry is philosophically resonant; tension between observation and participation sustains thematic unity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through metaphysical inversion (immortality as inadequacy, miners' scars as superior to academicism); emotional restraint avoids formulaic AI tendencies, though some conceptual abstraction risks distancing pure humanity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting whole despite tight constraints; the brevity feels purposeful, not limited; the central metaphor of contradictory "creation from nothing" unifies disparate components under a clear philosophical lens.</comment>
