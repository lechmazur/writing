<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority, emotional complexity, or distinct voice. Motivation exists as abstract concept rather than humanized need. Actions follow theme but don't reveal psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Loose structure relies on thematic progression rather than narrative causality. Pacing prioritizes poetic rhythm over dramatic timing, creating episodic flow without substantial escalation or payoff within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details create immersive, surreal environment. Sensory elements (salt-crusted scrolls, void's currents) ground metaphysical concepts in tangible imagery that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</comment>Unique voice and elegant metaphors create thought-provoking moments. Subtext about preservation works well, but emotional impact suffers from thematic telling rather than character-based showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases exhibit ornamental repetition, particularly with adjective clusters. Tropes like "salvaging lost knowledge" feel familiar though recontextualized. Sensory details are specific but occasionally serve atmosphere over narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and conceptual beauty elevated by poetic language, though limited character engagement slightly undermines overall impact. Ambitious ideas resonate beyond surface narrative.</comment>
