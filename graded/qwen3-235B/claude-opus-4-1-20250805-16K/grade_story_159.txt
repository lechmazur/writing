<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is philosophically rich but lacks emotional depth; motivation through betrayal is clear but minimally enacted, leaving some motivations underexplored despite poetic allusions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure shows ingenuity but feels slightly compressed; the confetti’s transformation into coordinates lacks a fully satisfying causal chain, and the resolution, while thematic, risks underdeveloping the journey.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (honey-colored stone, lanterns) create atmosphere, but some elements (floating lanterns, weather-beaten textures) could deepen their interplay with character and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor resonate (labyrinth as metaphor for fractured identity), but emotional impact is occasionally diluted by overly ornate descriptions that prioritize style over visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original in concept (love as metaphysical geometry), but occasionally falters into poetic abstraction; some phrases ("pockets full of paper snowflakes") risk self-consciousness over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ideas are layered and cohesive, but the word limit exposes slight structural thinness in connecting Marcus’s personal growth to the labyrinth’s "acceptance," leaving thematic resonance slightly unfulfilled.</comment>
