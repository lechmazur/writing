<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chen’s transformation from exile to acceptance is conceptually clear but lacks visceral emotional nuance; her motivation (court-ordered punishment) feels underexplored beyond surface-level atonement, though her interactions with objects (coathanger, postcards) subtly tether her psychological arc to physical artifacts. Dialogue reveals depth but sparingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot’s circularity (exile→resolution→extension) satisfies structurally, but the six-month timeframe condenses her growth too neatly. The “lurch” opening sparks tension that dissipates without fully dramatizing stakes; cause/effect for her request for extension feels unearned despite effective thematic throughlines.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is visceral—sensory details like “prayer wheel” solar panels and rustling postcards immerse readers in a liminal space of decay and hope. Atmosphere mirrors Chen’s internal shift, but the “simulated grass” picnics with students lean abstract, weakening the setting’s tether to emotional reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (debris as mistakes, “branches of redemption”) resonate with quiet profundity. The ending avoids sentimentality, privileging cyclical endurance over closure. Subtext about institutional failure and personal reinvention emerges organically, though the throughline between postcards and Chen’s epiphany could feel tighter.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés (esp. redemption arc) by anchoring abstraction in tangible objects (coathanger, postcards). The “bird migration” metaphor and debris-as-ambition juxtapose technical and lyrical tones deftly. Slight overreliance on familiar “solitude=wisdom” tropes prevents perfection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unpolished edges—underdeveloped picnics, abrupt ending—hint at a story straining against its word count. Yet the central theme (fragments creating meaning) aligns with the fragmented structure, suggesting intentionality. Ambitious but unevenly realized.</comment>
