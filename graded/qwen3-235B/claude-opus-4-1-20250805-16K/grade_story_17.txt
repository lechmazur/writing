<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character struggles feel somewhat superficial; inner conflict is stated but underexplored. Motivation announced rather than embodied through nuanced choices. Dialogue lacks distinction beyond archetypal "witch" tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot logic holds but transformation seems too convenient. Effective economy of structure overall, but pivotal shift lacks emotional buildup and feels rushed within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting relies on tropes (witch's lair) with minimal sensory integration. Atmosphere established through surface descriptors rather than deep immersion or original worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (tea as departed souls, eulogies as maps) show promise but execution leans toward neatness over genuine emotional complexity. Ending attempts profundity but feels contrived rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some fresh conceptual merging of genealogy and eulogy analysis salvages predictability, but "witch as truthkeeper" trope and explicit thematic statements undermine originality. Purple prose near-avoided but some abstraction persists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved but lacks transcendent impact. Elements serve plot mechanics more than thematic depth; emotional resonance remains surface-level rather than lingering.</comment>
