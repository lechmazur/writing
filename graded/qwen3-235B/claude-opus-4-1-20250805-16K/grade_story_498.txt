<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but under-explored; Marcus's nervousness conflicts with his decisive actions, weakening complexity. His backstory with his grandmother is hinted at but doesn't deeply humanize him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is purposeful, but the detour and unplanned seed drop feel slightly contrived. Pacing works for the word limit, though the ending resolution risks oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Xenophobic settlement midwinter setting is evocative, with precise sensory details (frost warnings, rattling seeds). Atmosphere masterfully reinforces oppression and latent rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storytelling is impactful through metaphor ("tyranny of indifference") and subtext. Understated narration ("unplanned seed") adds emotional resonance, though dialogue is sparse and underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tics with specific imagery ("genetic memory"), but some phrases ("roots too deep") verge on clich√©. The central concept elevates beyond tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional thematic cohesion; every element serves the metaphor of resistance through growth. The brief length enhances urgency, leaving an enduring impression of defiant hope.</comment>
