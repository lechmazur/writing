<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and tied to the obsessive nature established, but emotional depth remains surface-level. The connection between her compulsion and the ultimate revelation feels organic, though internal conflicts lack layered exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to revelation, with a satisfying arc. Pacing is efficient within constraints, though the transition to the resonance climax could be smoother. Coherence is maintained through consistent ties to the notebook's instructions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually striking atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., "fruit-sweet air," humming bridge supports). The rewilded highway setting perfectly reinforces the theme of forgotten infrastructure as sacred space, creating a haunting, immersive tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elicits intrigue and contemplation about legacy and preservation. Strong use of metaphor (orchard as instrument) and symbolism. Ending feels earned, though deeper emotional engagement is slightly undercut by minimalism inherent in the structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clichés; the "goddess as urban planner" subverts expectation. Writing is purposeful without excessive ornamentation. Subtle character nuance exists, but some transitions (e.g., understanding resonance) lean slightly on premise over character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elements harmonize to support a cohesive narrative—each choice (notebook, setting, character traits) serves the theme. The integration of music and urban decay offers lingering resonance, though the brevity prevents full thematic saturation.</comment>
