<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly developed; the protagonist's determination to foster coexistence lacks emotional grounding or personal stakes. The Mothman's dialogue adds intrigue but functions more as thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized entity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc within constraints, but reliance on conveniences like a sentient creature appearing on cue weakens internal logic. Pacing stumbles slightly during the abrupt transition to seed-planting as resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid descriptions like "autumn leaves scraped against broken windows" and "mirrors glowing faintly with promise." The setting's decay enhances the theme of human failure and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance via metaphor (candle map as teaching tool, garden as coexistence symbol). Dialogue carries thematic weight, and ending evokes lingering hope without feeling forced despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in cryptid/human dynamics but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction ("beacon flowers," "crystalline structure") that feels contrived rather than organic. Descriptions sometimes prioritize beauty over specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally woven (mirrors as liminal space, seeds as thematic throughline) but strain under demands of brevity. The ambitious concept occasionally overwhelms cohesion, particularly in the candle-reading method.</comment>
