<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant but psychologically thin at times; Rosa’s trauma manifests through tangible symbols (shaking hands, amber) rather than internal complexity, making her relatable but occasionally archetypal. The father-legacy thread lacks deeper exploration of her guilt over the lost child.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Circular structure works but strains under the brevity; the rumor-chain progression feels slightly mechanical yet culminates in a satisfying emotional payoff. Pacing stumbles only in the transition from Munich to Vienna, which reads as shorthand rather than earned connection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and thematically rich—the cathedral’s fusion of decay and rebirth is rendered through tactile details (spray paint as prayer beads, gold strokes on amber) that immerse and deepen the story’s existential yearning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (amber→art, trembling→transformation) and subtext (creation as penance) elevate the narrative. The ending’s thematic clarity (“permission to change”) avoids didacticism, while the spider-into-wings imagery lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in merging war trauma with artistic redemption; risks melodrama (e.g., “impossible moment where past and present collapsed”) but avoids it with precise, non-declamatory prose. Tension between destruction/creation feels genuinely human, not schematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements (amber, rumors, cathedral) cohere into a meditation on memory’s malleability. The brevity feels intentional, focusing on symbolic micro-moments rather than sprawling backstory. Leaves the reader with tactile and emotional echoes, not empty poetics.</comment>
