<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's crossword background lacks sufficient narrative integration; inconsistent depth in how personality attributes shape methods and reactions. Motivation is clear but insufficiently nuanced through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence but struggles with pacing; rapid resolution feels compressed. Logical causality exists but sacrifices emotional payoff. Ending fulfills arc constraints but feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere succeeds through specific details (ink-stained fingers, hymn-like whispers) but relies slightly on generic gothic tropes. Temporal and sensory connections between setting and theme are effective but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (crosswords as reality, pen as scalpel) elevates impact. Subtext about historical trauma remains potent, though emotional resonance is somewhat undercut by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with inventive premise; occasional florid prose ("DNA of human grudges") risks pretension. Sensory details generally vivid but lack distinct individual voice. Subtlety in thematic nuance outweighs formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>ELEMENTS are structurally integrated but not deeply transformative. Stylistic ambition enhances coherence, though brevity limits thematic expansion. Leverages constraints productively but feels like excerpted fragment.</comment>
