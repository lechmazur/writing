<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's professional role is clear but emotional depth lacks; the baseball cap's significance doesn't fully develop, and the necromancer's unique gift feels more procedural than viscerally experienced through her perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot advances through episodic discoveries rather than causal progression; the cinematic memory device creates engaging set pieces but structural cohesion feels compromised by the compressed scope, leaving the narrative feeling fragmented rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystalline cave's phosphorescence and memory-laden atmosphere create hauntingly tactile imagery; the Neo-Tokyo setting's temporal ambiguity strengthens the futuristic nostalgia tone while specific sensory intersections between geological features and ghostly projections enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like spirits as film reels are clever but unevenly executed; the story shows potential for layered meaning about collective memory but emotional engagement remains intellectualized rather than visceral, with the ending feeling more like a pause than resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the necromancer-geology hybrid premise has freshness, the cinematic-spirits mechanism feels conceptually neat rather than deeply explored; avoids outright purple prose but occasionally relies on AI-typical phrasing patterns that temper originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Competent execution of assigned elements without complete synthesis; the story functions but would not significantly lose coherence with substitutions in several key categories, though the nostalgic-futurist premise offers lingering philosophical intrigue.</comment>
