<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s feral nature informs her connection to unfiltered perception, but her deeper emotional complexity and history remain underexplored, relying on sparse exposition rather than organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a pivotal cry and exposition about the resistance, but the condensed format creates abrupt transitions between backstory and present action, slightly undermining narrative fluidity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, particularly in its use of dandelions and the brass scale, but the empire’s perception-filtration mechanism feels underdeveloped, weakening the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (balance, seeds, unfiltered truth) elevates the story, though some thematic weight is lost in moments of exposition-heavy introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in merging dystopian tropes with natural symbolism, but some elements (e.g., "precisely random") risk feeling derivative, and the receipt-based resistance lacks organic integration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s ambitious themes and poetic imagery elevate it beyond formulaic dystopian tales, though its brevity leaves certain elements—particularly the empire’s mechanics—underexplored.</comment>
