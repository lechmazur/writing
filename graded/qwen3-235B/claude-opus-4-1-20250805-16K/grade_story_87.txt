<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's patient trait is inconsistently manifest; inner conflict is well-imbued but lacks nuance in motivations beyond vengeance and regret. Actions feel emotionally resonant yet psychologically cursory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from memory to catharsis, but pacing falters in middle exposition; the inciting action (burning tapes) is emotionally earned but structurally abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Steampunk elements are superficially immersive but insufficiently integrated into character psychology or plot logic; sensory details are vivid yet occasionally overstylized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegantly woven metaphors ("hatred as love's armor") and cyclical imagery elevate the narrative; tension between memory and erasure lingers, though emotional beats lean on familiar tragic-genius tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s but contains faint traces of emotional shorthand ("storm inside") and slightly mechanical phrasing ("building blocks of innovation"). Sensory details avoid generic descriptors but occasionally prioritize aesthetic over meaning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but lean on set dressing over thematic necessity; the ending achieves thematic closure but lacks lingering resonance; brevity serves as strength for emotional restraint but limits deeper exploration of loss.</comment>
