<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's emotional arc from detachment to vulnerability is discernible but feels abbreviated by the word limit; her voice remains consistent though underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from discovery to decision is logical, but the climactic revelation about the stones and the Rift feels compressed, undermining narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but thin on sensory specifics; the Rift’s influence could be more deeply integrated into setting and character interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors and subtext (detachment vs. connection) elevate the narrative; the ending’s emotional resonance is undercut slightly by prior underdevelopment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the stones and Rift are original, the orphan archetype and "cryptic message" trope lean predictable; emotional beats occasionally veer toward explicit over implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Elements cohere but strain under high expectations; themes and symbols are purposeful, yet the story’s brevity sacrifices depth for conciseness.</grade>
