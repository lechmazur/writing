<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chen’s contradiction as a "hatefully adored" genius is implied but underexplored—her brilliance and abrasiveness shape her actions and the crew’s resentment, but her deeper motivations remain hinted rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the broken chopstick’s symbolic and functional role, but the 400-word arc feels compressed—Chen’s influence on Morrison lacks visceral development, and the abrupt transition from conflict to acceptance undermines emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submarine’s sterile hum, glowing plankton, and nocturnal stillness create a haunting atmosphere; however, tactile and olfactory details (e.g., the smell of miso, the damp cold of the facility) are absent, limiting immersive depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "bioluminescent chaos," "spiritual architecture") and the fractured chopstick’s symbolism elevate the theme. The ending’s juxtaposition of the abandoned intact chopstick with Chen’s departure underscores the core message viscerally, though minor overuse of poetic abstraction slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrases (e.g., "bioluminescent chaos patterns") border on jargon, and the captain’s abrupt shift from dismissal to acquiescence feels too pat. While the fractured-chopstick metaphor is original, the story occasionally leans on thematic clichés (e.g., "order in chaos") without fully subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story coalesces around its central metaphor but falters in character nuance and pacing. The juxtaposition of domestic objects (cookbook, chopsticks) with scientific enigma is inventive, yet the brief length leaves some ideas (e.g., the crew’s mixed feelings) underdeveloped.</comment>
