<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (avenging mentor's death, desire to impose silence) is clear and shapes her actions, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped. The fusion of sound engineer and witch lacks psychological depth. Strength lies in how her "clumsily dexterous" trait manifests through tactile, musical movements, but emotional complexity feels lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight escalation-to-resolution arc within constraints, but the swift transition from silent retribution to crowd transformation risks feeling unearned. Action sequence in the square is visceral but pivotal moments (mob's realization) lack concrete sensory grounding, creating a slight narrative gap between cause and effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually stunning atmosphere through surreal details (mercury sliders, resonant stained glass, "orange waves of fury"). The "witch's cauldron room" creates eerie cohesion, and silence as a tangible force elevates the stakes. Some metaphors (e.g., "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard") verge on abstraction but sustain the story's ethereal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with inventive sensory metaphors ("chanting becomes visible," "footfalls as harmonies"). Subtext about sound as the root of reality resonates profoundly. The ending's thematic payoff—imposition of listening over silence—is emotionally resonant. Occasionally veers toward overdense lyricism but mostly earns its poetic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original concept executed with stylistic boldness. Avoids witch/sound engineer tropes through surreal metaphors and the "practical illusion" theme. Some phrases (e.g., "drunk pianist playing Mozart perfectly") feel slightly overworked. Emotional subtext emerges through action rather than exposition, balancing vivid originality and human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces into a haunting meditation on sound/power, with form mirroring content through rhythmic sentences. Elements serve theme cohesively—stained glass fragment as both literal/healing object, cauldron as intersection of science/mysticism. Brief length amplifies the mythic resonance of Mara's silent victory.</comment>
