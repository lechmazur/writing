<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but lacks psychological complexity; actions are logically consistent but internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive but compressed; setup and resolution connect logically, though pacing feels rushed in moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked with sensory details (e.g., "pulse with chronological energy"), but some worldbuilding elements (e.g., time-traveler interactions) feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</comment>  
<comment>Elegantly layered subtext (truth vs. institutional control) and symbolic use of sound/echoes elevate the narrative, though emotional resonance leans cerebral over visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (rebellion against a dystopian academy) undercut originality, yet the twist on time’s “travel through us” avoids full cliché status.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the concept lingers, structural brevity weakens emotional payoff; integration of elements is clever but unevenly weighted.</comment>
