<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has strong visual/emotional presence but lacks interiority - a collection of poetic traits without psychological depth or organic emotional progression beyond symbolic resolution</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is atmospheric rather than action-driven; beginning/end connection exists through symbolic closure but lacks traditional dramatic arc necessary for structural completeness in tight constraints</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through atmospheric unity rather than narrative ingenuity; time constraint challenges fully realized themes but ending lingers with philosophical weight through metaphorical resolution</comment>
