<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's internal struggle is clear, but motivations (especially psychological nuance of "remembering") lack depth. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot builds around assigned elements but feels compressed; cause-effect logic exists but lacks momentum between key plot points due to brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (ghost town, artificial birds), but integration of tactile sensations (e.g., "impossible reality" of pamphlet) remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext about memory vs. simulation, but emotional resonance is undercut by abrupt ending. Theme of "truth collapsing lies" is consistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original use of coin-melodies and "building memories" avoids clich√©, but relies on familiar simulation tropes without deeper subversion. Language avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on generic phrases ("iron fingers").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but feel constrained by word limit. Leaves thematic questions but lacks visceral impact; ending resolves too abstractly.</comment>
