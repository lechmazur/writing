<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters display clear motivations tied to their traits, but emotional depth feels slightly underexplored despite strong core conflict. Dialogue effectively reveals history but could use more nuanced psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but some transitions (moon phases, tapestry mechanics) lack sufficient development. Pacing balances revelation and tension adequately within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Haunted setting is atmospheric but could integrate more tactile details beyond visual decay. The owl symbolism and tactile pencil box enhance mood, though some sensory elements remain underused.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story evokes poignant emotional transformation through restrained prose. Metaphors like moths from fortune cards are effective; ending achieves thematic unity with layered implications about truth and redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Risks of formulaic curses avoided through unique consequences and character-specific history. Emotional beats feel earned rather than stated, though some phrasing (e.g., "tapestry of fate") borders on familiar abstractions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion despite some underdeveloped elements. The tight word limit serves emotional pacing well, though certain plot mechanics (moon phases) feel more structural than organic.</comment>
