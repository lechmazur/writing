<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving folk medicine) is clear and drives action, but emotional depth and nuance feel occasionally surface-level beneath poetic imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically between key moments, but the tight word limit sacrifices resolution of smaller threads; emotional beats feel rushed despite strong conceptual arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (rust, rattling chains) effectively create decay; haunted park's decay mirrors the theme of forgotten knowledge but occasionally strains plausibility as a living lab.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (gold-filled cracks, music encoding) creates layered meaning; the ending resonates thematically with legacy and transformation, though emotional impact leans on metaphor rather than earned character moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in playlist hacking conceit is undermined by familiar tropes (noble rebel vs. evil corporations); language is poetic but occasionally over-embellished (e.g., "algorithms' signal," "footsteps writing prescriptions").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually with minor friction; themes of reclamation elevate genre tropes, though execution occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative precision.</comment>
