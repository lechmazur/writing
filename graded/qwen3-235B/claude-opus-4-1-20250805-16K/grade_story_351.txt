<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Character's rebelliousness feels underexplored in current actions; poetic voice is distinct but motivation transition from manifesto-writer to guardian lacks nuanced emotional beats within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Begins with mystery, ends with inheritance arc; cryptic shapes and discovery flow logically, but pacing slightly falters in mid-section compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wistful decay permeates sensory details; ivy/columns/sundial cohere into a mournful tapestry that enhances the theme of erasure and remembrance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense metaphors and poetic compression create lingering resonance; subtext about historical memory elevates beyond plot mechanics, though emotional beats could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in blending decay and resistance; avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing that feels more like aesthetic choice than thematic necessity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements feel deeply integrated into a unified metaphor; the sundial, wax seal, and "unremembered" tie into a meditation on contested narratives that lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
