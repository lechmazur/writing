<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's fading nature and motivation for rebellion are hinted but not deeply integrated; her apathy undermines coherence between stated motivations and her detached persistence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression; tension introduced by approaching footsteps isn't resolved, making narrative feel incomplete despite atmospheric pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking, cohesive imagery (stars "gorged on darkness," lavender's practical mysticism) creates a haunting, immersive post-apocalyptic world with layered sensory and symbolic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sophisticated use of metaphor ("world's newest shore") and subtextual rebellion through memory preservation; ending elevates the narrative thematically despite minimalist structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minimal clich√©s; lavender's dual role and hacking-as-boredom subvert expectations; some phrasing ("data streams... humanity's ghost stories") risks overpolished detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically (e.g., lavender ties atmosphere to character), though the unresolved ending sacrifices emotional payoff for thematic abstraction.</comment>
