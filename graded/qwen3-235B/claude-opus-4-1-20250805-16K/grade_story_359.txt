<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack deeper exploration of Marcus's internal conflict; the absent-mindedness is shown but not fully integrated beyond plot convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves logically through Marcus's emotional arc, but the rushed resolution at the archive weakens the build toward his decision to teach, leaving some cause-and-effect underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of the archive and post-AI world create a cohesive melancholic tone, though physical sensations (e.g., brass texture, train station ambiance) could be more vividly rendered to enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphor use (e.g., "earth's dying pulse") and subtext about human imperfection as value elevate the narrative, though dialogue remains functional rather than distinctively styled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids artificial writing marks with restrained, purposeful prose and nuanced emotional subtext; the "extinct birds" metaphor resists cliché, but some phrasing ("grief cracked open") leans toward abstraction over sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation amid obsolescence is cohesively maintained, though the brevity sacrifices secondary character depth; the ending’s emotional resonance feels earned rather than formulaic.</comment>
