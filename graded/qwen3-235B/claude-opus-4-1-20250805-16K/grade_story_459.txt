<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's ghost-seeing occupation and quest for answers about haunting dynamics are conceptually rich but lack emotional depth; her introspection remains metaphor-driven rather than psychologically complex despite thematic resonance in her interactions with Dr. Chen and the flower crown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot's circular structure (lab reflections → elevator resolution) works within the word limit, but transitions between key narrative threads (ghost tours, flower crown, lab dialogues) feel compressed rather than elegantly condensed; thematic payoff justifies structural tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sand castle lab's visual contrasts (frozen impermanence vs. elevator hauntings) are striking, but the atmosphere lacks multisensory texture—polymer spray is the only tactile detail anchoring the lab's scientific-preservation duality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sand castles/ghost metaphors are skillfully layered; the ending's philosophical weight ("preservation vs. release as love") transcends simplicity through concrete imagery rather than abstraction; some reliance on thematic repetition dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uses AI-resistant elements (elevators-as-liminal-space, flower crown symbolism) inventively, but risks cliché through heavy metaphorical exposition ("beauty in holding onto something meant to fall apart") that occasionally substitutes for visceral character experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole—the lab-elevator duality, ghost tours' narrative red herring—but the brief form prioritizes poetic resonance over narrative ambition, creating a polished but slight philosophical parable.</comment>
