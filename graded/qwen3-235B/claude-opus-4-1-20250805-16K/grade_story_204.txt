<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character development is clear but emotionally thin; Mira's transformation feels abrupt despite hints of generational trauma. Her profession as a cuddler informs her touch-related conflicts but remains underexplored, reducing her dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but constrained by the word limit—pacing falters in the middle. The transition from market to ceremony lacks depth, and the resolution hinges on a thematic epiphany that feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (decaying brass, broken panels, cathedral ceiling) create a haunting atmosphere. The contrast between organic decay and reclaimed spaces effectively reinforces the theme, though the "ancient novelty" tone occasionally veers into vagueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its central metaphor but leans on exposition to convey theme. The ending resonates emotionally through symbolic gestures but lacks subtlety in execution. Subtext is implied but uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with the "cuddler" profession and decaying machinery motifs. Some phrases ("unusually usual") border on pretension, but emotional beats (e.g., inherited prejudice) feel humanly nuanced against occasionally formulaic transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally feel imposed. The brevity works for thematic framing but sacrifices emotional depth. The ending's metaphor lingers, but the story's impact is diluted by unresolved narrative compression.</comment>
