<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's duality is strongly embodied through contrast between timid waking self and dream-state power. The dinosaur plush effectively ties to her past survival, though her inner psychology lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from hesitant beginning to hopeful resolution, with dream sequences progressing thematically. Pacing is efficient within constraints; action feels organic to the premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details create haunting atmosphere (electrodes, xenon's "peculiar blue-white," tactile plush texture). Timeframe/setting reinforce tone, though pandemic context remains understated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (tapestry, fossils) and layered subtext about art as healing give depth. Ending achieves thematic resonance. Somewhat risks overwriting but stays purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains occasionally ornate phrasing ("electric lullabies," "quiet thunder"). Nuanced emotional beats outweigh formulaic elements; tone remains cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements like pandemic, time's fragility, and dream-hopping intertwine naturally with motif of transformation. Style choice justifies length; lingers emotionally beyond page.</comment>
