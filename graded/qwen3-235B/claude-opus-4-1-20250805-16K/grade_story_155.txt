<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Minimal interiority undermines connection to Marcus' transformation; motivations feel imposed rather than organically revealed through actions; "patently impatient" trait remains superficially sketched. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Time-bending premise collapses rather than crescendos under word count constraints; key confrontations occur off-page; sealed timelines' consequences remain emotionally underdeveloped. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Electrifying sensory dissonance between neon-drenched quantum chaos and tactile weight of buttons; underwater pressure metaphors could have deeper integration with temporal compression themes. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sublime interplay of welding as both literal craft and cosmic metaphor; temporal dissonance imagery lingers but emotional resonance remains surface-level despite lyrical language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids time-travel tropes through naval uniform reflections and button alchemy; occasionally stumbles into ornate description ("cosmic lock") that dilutes narrative intensity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of quantum physics and domestic ephemera succeeds thematically but loses human dimensionality; structural ingenuity outpaces character engagement.</comment>
