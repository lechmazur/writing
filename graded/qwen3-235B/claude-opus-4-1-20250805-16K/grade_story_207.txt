<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but internal conflict could be more nuanced. The "meekly assertive" trait works effectively in both past and present, but some emotional reactions lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels slightly compressed. Gaps exist between the protagonist's discovery process and the authorities' arrival, sacrificing tension for brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambiance is strong with sensory decay and cosmic imagery, but metaphysical elements like the "secret song" risk abstraction over immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Idealism and sacrifice themes resonate. The ending blends catharsis with melancholy effectively, though dramatic dialogue ("forge myself anew" phrasing) borders on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids predictable resolution, but "cosmic indifference" and "armor of loneliness" lean into familiar sci-fi tropes. Sensory details (preserved DNA) show inventiveness but aren't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesive but feels shaped by constraints. The space station setting serves multiple purposes, though some elements (gossip columns) strain credibility as evidence.</comment>
