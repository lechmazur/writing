<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's mutism is integral but underexplored; Clarence's voice lacks differentiation; motivation to redefine family is clear but emotional resonance feels somewhat surface-level despite concept.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coincidental overheard calls drive progression coherently; tight arc from eavesdropping to action; pacing balanced despite brevity; minor confusion about how parallel universe mechanics influence the structural logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirror Beach's inverted physics create a vivid, thematically resonant setting; sensory details (burning snow, upward shadows) masterfully enhance the surreal mood that reflects Marcus's internal transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potent emotional arc achieved through symbolic objects and restrained narration; the ending avoids sentimentality while maintaining thematic unity; metaphors (coffee sleeve, inverted weather) deepen subtext about reconstructed normalcy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in inverted phenomena; avoids predictable emotional beats; avoids generic descriptors (burning snow, lightning that "strikes before thunder"); maintains unique tone through consistent surreal imagery rather than purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements work collaboratively rather than decoratively; brevity feels purposeful; lingers in the mind through its juxtaposition of impossibility (backward storms) with human vulnerability (mutism, grief).</comment>
