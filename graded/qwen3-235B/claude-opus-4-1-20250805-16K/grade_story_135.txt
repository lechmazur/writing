<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira's ambition and loyalty are clear motivators, driving her quest, but her internal conflicts and growth feel underdeveloped. Her "peculiar faith" lacks nuanced exploration, though her actions align with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The decoding of bruises propels the action effectively. Pacing is tight but occasionally rushed, particularly in the climax, yet maintains logical cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (metal straw clinking, ice storms) create an immersive, haunting world. The frozen harbor’s mechanical caravans and touch-based language deepen the atmosphere, though some concepts lean on abstract worldbuilding without full explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (language as fermentation, silence as violence) resonate emotionally. The theme of preserving language through action, not just text, is profound. Ending fulfills the arc elegantly, with layered meaning in "lost paths" as transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh integration of fermentation and linguistics avoids predictability. Some descriptors (aged honey-wine, rust-colored path) verge on ornate but serve the tone. Subtext about cultural memory elevates it above formulaic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh well conceptually, though fleeting explanations (e.g., post-wheel timeframe) disrupt flow. The brevity enhances urgency, but some worldbuilding feels truncated. Lingering questions about the Guild and Kira’s future leave room for reflection.</comment>
