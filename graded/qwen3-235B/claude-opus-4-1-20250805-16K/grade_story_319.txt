<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character's frailty and wavering resolve are established but underexplored; motivation for escape feels authentic but lacks layered psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows with purposeful momentum; high-concept action (phial use) resolves internal conflict without sacrificing coherence, though some transitions between scenes feel compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral atmosphere (salt-weathered oak, sour phial) immerses readers; tidal setting and color-coded allegiances deepen thematic symbolism through tactile details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subtext about systemic oppression resonates; poetic imagery ("marks slide like water") and ambiguous ending balance hope with existential risk. Emotional restraint amplifies impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (carved messages as rebellion) while maintaining stylistic clarity; emotional beats shown through action (trembling hands, receding tide) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate with thematic precision; brevity serves purpose by focusing on existential choice; ending lingers as existential metaphor rather than narrative conclusion.</comment>
