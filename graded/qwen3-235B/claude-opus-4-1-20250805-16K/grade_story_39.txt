<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's skills as a tailor tie to her role, but her emotional depth remains underexplored despite resonant motivations. Consistency in actions, but lacks nuanced psychological layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from repair to communal impact but feels compressed; some beats about community adoption of her work could be more gradual. Pacing uneven in middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cracked biodome, rustling books, and synthetic/organic decay create haunting textures. Lantern light's interplay with warped architecture is vivid, though Martian specifics feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mix of technical precision and poetic metaphor ("stitch an act of endurance against forgetting") elevates materiality into memory work. Ending lacks emotional punch but the weaving of hope into practicality is poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While phrases like "luminous and strange" border on pretentious, most imagery (water-damaged books projecting memories) avoids cliché. Emotional subtext emerges through objects rather than stating, but some stiffness in character logic remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically—lantern's projections transform tailoring into ritual, Martian setting contextualizes desperation. Narrow word count occasionally strains thematic density but leaves lingering questions about collective trauma.</comment>
