<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei's professional perspective on death is consistent but underdeveloped; her transformation through reading the manuscript feels earned but lacks visceral emotional beats. The "neutrally passionate" trait is conceptually strong but rarely demonstrated through specific actions beyond floristry and philosophical monologues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a spiritual journey arc with admirable economy, but the celestial dojo metaphysics remain under-explored. The typed pages mechanism drives progression but feels more like narrative scaffolding than organic discovery, with cosmic revelations arriving through exposition rather than dramatic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (mist, candlelight, decaying wreaths) create tangible atmosphere, though the floating dojo's physics and cultural context remain frustratingly nebulous. The dying lantern's symbolism works beautifully, but the setting's conceptual grandeur overshadows its practical implementation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (flowers, flames, cosmic wheel) create resonant subtext. The central theme of cyclical transformation is both intellectually rigorous and emotionally evocative, with the final image of the balanced flame serving as a masterful thematic unifier. Dialogue remains purposeful despite limited interaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar mystical tropes (floating sanctuaries, dying mentors) without sufficient subversion. Language remains poetic yet precise, though some flower-based metaphors verge on overused. Subtext through objects (wilted flowers, unwritten manuscripts) prevents pure abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically cohesive whole despite occasional conceptual weight. The florist-dojo juxtaposition demonstrates ingenuity, and brevity serves its meditative tone. Leaves lingering questions about mortality without feeling incomplete, balancing poetic ambiguity with narrative purpose.</comment>
