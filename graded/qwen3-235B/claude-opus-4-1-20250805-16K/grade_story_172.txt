<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s accidental heroism is conceptually clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth in her internal conflict. The puzzle box and prophecy shape her actions, but her voice occasionally defaults to archetypal gravitas rather than distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually tight but constrained by the word limit—the hallway opening and seashell transformation feel rushed. The reversed wish mechanics are logical but under-explained, and the ending’s thematic resolution arrives abruptly without earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorgeous, layered sensory details (acoustic resonance, fossilized geometry) create a vivid, alien atmosphere. The seashell-as-architecture metaphor is evocative, though the deserted beach setting remains underutilized beyond its visual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "frozen fireworks") and thematic subtext about embracing destiny. The ending’s twist—prophecy as invitation—is memorable, though some emotional beats rely on thematic assertions rather than experiential buildup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative avoids clichés but sometimes overcompensates with baroque descriptions ("mathematical prayers"). Sensory details are specific but occasionally veer into overwrought abstraction. The accidental hero arc is fresh, though Marina’s emotional trajectory feels slightly schematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While ambitious in theme and imagery, the compressed structure feels dictated by format rather than intentionality. Some assigned elements (e.g., reversed wishes) strain cohesion, but the seashell’s metaphysical logic lingers as a haunting, original conceit.</comment>
