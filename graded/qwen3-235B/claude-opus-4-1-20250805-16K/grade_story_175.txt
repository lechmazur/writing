<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character driven by clear motivation but lacks internal complexity. Dialogues reveal traits but no meaningful evolution. Elder serves as flat antagonist without nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through resonant action with logical cause/effect, but relies on compressed time cues rather than earned tension. Resolution feels narratively complete yet structurally abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sensory details create vivid atmosphere, but mycelial sentience concept demands deeper physical/thematic integration for full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (birdcage, spores) and layered metaphors elevate impact. Some emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction over character-driven realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original setting avoids generic fantasy tropes, but "feral elegance" tone occasionally veers into self-consciously literary language rather than organic expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Excellent thematic cohesion despite tight constraints. Emotional resonance weakened by minimal character differentiation among villagers.</comment>
