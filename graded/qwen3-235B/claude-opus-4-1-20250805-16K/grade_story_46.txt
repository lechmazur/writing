<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character serves as an atmospheric device more than a fully realized entity; motivations implied through action but lack emotional depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Static structure lacks traditional arc but creates cyclical momentum through ritualistic repetition; coherence maintained but growth/resolution minimal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion grounds surreal elements; setting functions as both obstacle and collaborator in the character's work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (dream logic, containment of chaos through ritual) but narrative momentum remains diffuse; style transcends gimmickry.</comment>
