<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s curiosity drives her actions, but her character remains emotionally distant; motivations lack visceral depth despite intellectual coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from rain patterns to revelation, though the resolution feels abrupt for such a condensed form; emotional payoff outweighs structural flaws.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting—the graveyard’s decay and rain’s rhythms are palpable. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere into a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Profound use of metaphor (interference patterns as memory) and thematic resonance. The ending is emotionally ambiguous yet intellectually satisfying, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with few clichés. Language is poetic but never gratuitous. Subtext about love and multidimensional memory feels human-nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole. Uses brevity to its advantage, suggesting universes within a moment. Theme of transcendent love lingers.</comment>
