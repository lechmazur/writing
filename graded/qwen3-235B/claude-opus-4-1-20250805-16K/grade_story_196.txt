<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: The swordsman's internal conflict between apathy and buried defiance is compelling, with motivation tied to his unspoken promise. Weaknesses: His emotional arc remains underdeveloped due to word constraints; his transformation from apathy to action feels abrupt despite hints of buried trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Narrative flow connects resignation of Master Chen to the protagonist's choice, using meteors as both plot device and metaphor. Weaknesses: The compressed arc feels rushed—key emotional stakes could use more buildup, though the word limit is handled skillfully for a short piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Floating monastery and meteor sequences create vivid, mystical atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's emotional journey. Weaknesses: Limited time/space prevents full exploration of setting's potential—floating rocks feel more symbolic than practically integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Metaphorical language ("armor of apathy," "chains of promises") elevates theme of quiet rebellion; ending balances melancholy with hope. Weaknesses: Emotional subtext occasionally tips into abstraction rather than earned connection; some phrases lean on familiar imagery without subverting expectations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Meteors as temporary pathways show ingenuity; "knowing naivety" adds philosophical texture. Weaknesses: Floating monastery and resigned master border on fantasy tropes; character logic prioritizes thematic resonance over human authenticity in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Combines elements into coherent whole; the bag/promise connection and meteor-path decision show purposeful design. Weaknesses: Some elements (floating rocks) feel underutilized narratively; the theme of self-promises works, but execution stops short of profound.</comment>
