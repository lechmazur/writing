<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation of becoming a legend through subverting sacred traditions is clear but lacks emotional depth; her 'voice' is present but not distinctive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is driven by the act of dismantling, but the compressed timeframe muddies cause-effect clarity; ending feels abrupt despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting (canyon with shifting carvings) and sensory details (mirror's "perfectly flawed" surface, cosmic laughter) create immersive, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (mirror as transformation agent) and subtext (mythmaking vs. preservation) to explore themes of narrative control and legacy; ending resonates as both completion and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of mythic watchers and culinary subversion avoids clich√©; occasional overly ornate phrases ("canyon's edge, fingering the stolen tag") risk pretension but not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements but prioritizes atmospheric momentum over character nuance; lingers conceptually though emotional stakes feel distant.</comment>
