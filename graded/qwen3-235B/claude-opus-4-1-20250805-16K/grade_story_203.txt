<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina’s internal conflict is present but underdeveloped; her stage fright and exorcism duty feel conceptually juxtaposed rather than integrally defined. The reveal of her grandmother’s deception shapes her actions minimally beyond a surface-level emotional prompt. Dialogue lacks distinct voice; motivations are more stated than demonstrated through nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The key-turning inciting incident is effective, but the exorcism resolution feels abrupt. Pacing balances tension and reflection, though the arc relies on familiar genre beats (grandparent’s legacy, cosmic battle) without subverting expectations. Cause-effect clarity exists but lacks layered complexity within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere contrasts Earthbound magic with orbital decay; sensory details (glowing petals, skeletal satellites) immerse readers. The salvaged-toy-as-exorcism-tool concept cleverly merges setting and theme. Over-reliance on “void” vs. “Earth magic” binary slightly undermines nuance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphor (flower-as-ash-sculptor) create lingering resonance. Subtext about inherited trauma and redemption through creation is clear but unevenly earned. The defiant ending feels sincere but derivative; showing (e.g., trembling hands crafting amid fear) outpaces telling (“courage hidden beneath lies”) in effectiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Combines sci-fi and supernatural elements inventively but leans on genre tropes (demonic mimicry, therapists-with-secrets). Avoids overt clichés in object/persona pairings but lapses into stylized phrasing (“ancient power,” “shrieked into stardust”). Emotional beats occasionally rely on tell-don’t-show, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive metaphor elevates disjointed elements. The tension between loss and hope weaves through narrative and setting, though thematic beats are explicit rather than subtly revealed. Length feels constrained; deeper exploration of “inherited lies” or demon mechanics would improve longevity.</comment>
