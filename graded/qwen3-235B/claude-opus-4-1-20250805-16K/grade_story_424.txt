<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but emotional depth remains surface-level. The "mild zealot" trait informs her actions but isn't fully integrated with psychological complexity. Physical descriptions ("oddly typical") don't translate into distinctive behavioral patterns or internal contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot reveals its arc methodically through object-driven revelations, but the 400-word structure creates abrupt transitions between holographic sequences. The connection between historical currencies and quantum visualization feels underdeveloped. Resolution satisfies thematic intent but lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes old/new Geneva and rustic/high-tech lab effectively, but atmospheric details (machine hum, golden light) lean toward generic science-fiction tropes. The "strange attractor" concept isn't fully leveraged to create unique sensory experiences beyond visual metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the story beyond simple exposition, with potent metaphors like "maps to follow" for scars. The central theme of choice-as-attractor resonates, but emotional impact feels curated rather than organically earned. Some "telling" remains in philosophical conclusions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While conceptually original, execution reveals traces of algorithmic writing patterns: recurring phrases like "relentless march" and "roads not taken," emotionally resonant moments stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced character behavior, and occasionally vague sensory details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but with visible seams. The lab setting functions more as thematic scaffolding than organic environment. The brief length amplifies thematic clarity while sacrificing emotional immersion. Final reflection lingers intellectually rather than emotionally.</comment>
