<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is well-sketched but lacks nuanced internal conflict; motivations are clear but their evolution feels slightly underdeveloped within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative has emotional direction but lacks causal momentum; the plot is static despite the intimate transformation depicted, with resolution feeling abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Decay-as-rebirth motif is visceral and evocative; sensory details (glitter, vinyl, radiation) crystallize the tension between desolation and defiant beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (orchard=transformation), tone balances wry humor and vulnerability, but relies too heavily on stated themes rather than subtextual revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptually fresh but occasionally veers into self-congratulatory symbolism; glitter/resistance parallels feel occasionally didactic rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but execution borders on preciousness; the premiseâ€™s audacity elevates the slight narrative, leaving resonant echoes beyond the apocalypse.</comment>
