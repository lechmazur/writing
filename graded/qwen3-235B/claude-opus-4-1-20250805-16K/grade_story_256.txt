<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically articulated but lack complexity beyond symbolic function. Marcus's "loyally disloyal" conflict is conceptually rich but remains underexplored through action. Emotional resonance suffers from excessive abstraction in interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical circularity substitutes for plot progression, but the transactional structure (time exchange) maintains narrative tension. Pacing in confined space is masterful, though lack of tangible stakes creates emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "hummed lonely hymns" and ethereal foodstuffs create immersive liminal space. The grocery store/midnight framing juxtaposes mundane with mystical to haunting effect. Sensory precision elevates metaphysical conceits.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("stolen time's arithmetic") and haunting imagery creates lasting impact. Theme of cyclical self-exploitation resonates through symbolic economy of scale. Ending achieves metaphysical profundity while maintaining narrative continuity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Some phrases ("whipped into foam") border on clich√©, but overall the surreal fusion of bureaucracy and emotion feels inventive. Emotional states are shown through precise gestures rather than told, though occasional abstraction ("chronology's altar") risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified metaphysical parable. Time economy conceit remains consistent throughout. Ambiguous ending invites necessary contemplation of consequence. Brief format enhances existential compression rather than limiting depth.</comment>
