<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's hesitation drives the conflict but emotional stakes feel underexplored; motivation tied to compass and daughter lacks visceral, specific grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unpolished edges exist but cohesion dominates; chamber-as-metaphor for collective trauma/redemption feels earned despite constraints.</comment>
