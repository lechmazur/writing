<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character development lacks depth despite intriguing traits; Kestra behaves like an archetypal figure rather than a person with layered motivations. Her cyber-templar background shapes her technical actions but not her psychological complexity. The impatient patience during the ritual shows contradictory behavior, but the narrative doesn't explore these dimensions meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight cohesion through the prism's intervention, but the storm's recursive destruction feels abrupt. The collision between digital and physical realms creates narrative momentum, yet the transition from tension to victory relies on under-explained metaphysics rather than logical cause-effect relationships within the story's internal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through stark contrasts—sacred burial versus technological ghosts—but physical sensations feel selectively rendered. The plateau's cold, the vulture circulations, and the prism's heat create powerful impressions, while spiritual elements and digital overlays remain conceptually present rather than viscerally tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery ("teaching lightning to fear itself") and thematic interplay between virtual/permanent resonate memorably. The ending's thesis about vulnerability-as-protection satisfies emotionally, though some thematic delivery relies on overt statements rather than subtextual construction through sensory details or character evolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by fusing cyberpunk aesthetics with Tibetan spirituality. The prism-method stretches plausibility but works metaphorically. Phrases like "code-streams and corpse-flesh" demonstrate inventive conceptual marriage, though internal monologue occasionally descends into familiar techno-mysticism phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Story cohesively integrates all elements through refractive symbolism, but prioritizes concept over execution. The narrative compression leaves certain components (like spiritual implications) under-developed, though the sky burial-prism-light interaction exhibits creative synergy that makes the brief format feel purposeful rather than limited.</comment>
