<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Creative but inconsistent; the 'homeless' aspect feels underexplored, and the tyrant's backstory lacks psychological nuance. Strengths: unique voice through poetic abstraction of philosophy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot logic holds, but the 500-word arc feels compressed—tyrant’s betrayal resolution lacks emotional weight. Strengths: confetti as thematic McGuffin enhances progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid visuals hindered by underdeveloped time constraints and inconsistent atmosphere shifts (eerie labyrinth to whimsical weddings). Lanterns’ symbolic resonance underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates theme of fluid joy vs. rigid control. Weakness: final lines risk pretension with "living poem" abstraction; emotional impact diluted by ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but leans too heavily on decorative metaphors ("confetti-coded vows"). Betrayal subplot feels algorithmically resolved; insufficient subtext on power vs. creation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Element cohesion is strong for labyrinth/kaleidoscope but strained for weddings/timeframe. Weakness: "homeless" and "during readings" elements feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
