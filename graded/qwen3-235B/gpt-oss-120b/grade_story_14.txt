<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Characterization relies on poetic abstraction over psychological depth; motivations are implied through poetic metaphors but lack concrete behavioral grounding or internal conflict that feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure creates poetic cohesion but sacrifices narrative momentum; key transitions (professors vanishing, wax solidifying) feel undermotivated within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through synesthetic details (humming machinery, trembling wax, salt-and-metal tang) that fuse industrial decay with mystical undertones; setting as active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premature obituaries for luck as both metaphor and material force; candle-wax lighthouse as haunting synecdoche for doomed human agency, with emotional ambiguity more implied than overexplained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through surrealism but stumbles into ornamental prose rhythms; some visceral metaphors (porcelain cracks, whispered tides) elevate over formulaic phrasing while others border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under functionalismâ€”every object serves conceptual purpose at expense of organic strangeness; final image resonates but mechanical use of "bargain" lacks folkloric or emotional specificity.</comment>
