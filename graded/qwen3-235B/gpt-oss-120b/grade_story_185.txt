<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong motivation and clear connection between Selene's obsession and her calm, deliberate actions, but lacks depth in exploring her past or inner conflicts that might contextualize her sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot proceeds logically from preparation to climax, with cause-effect clarity in the mechanism, but the ending resolves too abruptly, leaving the world’s altered state underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imaginative sensory details (humming consoles, flaring graphite) and eerie atmosphere enhance the mystical tone, but the probability center’s history and millennia-spanning scope remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, symbolic resonance of the pencil as latent power, and thematic meditation on sacrifice elevate the narrative, though emotional impact is slightly muted by abstract diction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of mundane objects and cosmic stakes avoids genre tropes, but some phrasing ("fractured grace," "infuriatingly calm") borders on ornamental without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story tightly integrates elements into a cohesive whole where each piece supports mythic themes, though the brevity prevents deeper exploration of consequences or philosophical ramifications.</comment>
