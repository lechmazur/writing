<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's hesitation is present but underexplored; motivation to unravel sorrow tapestry feels externally imposed rather than psychologically rooted; the dinosaur plush reveals sentimental value but lacks narrative agency beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression through portal traversal but relies heavily on conceptual transitions rather than concrete cause-effect; dream-hopping mechanism feels abstract rather than functional; resolution lacks earned emotional weight despite successful tapestry transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through synesthetic details (humming machines, sealed-sigh compression) and conceptual time-capsule visuals; xenon lighting creates effective emotional dissonance against warm dinosaur plush; some spatial logic gaps in tunnel/machine relationship.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (time as fabric, voices as candles) elevates theme; closing image of warm plush as temporal proof provides satisfying symbolic resonance; lyrical prose successfully 'shows' fragility rather than stating it outright.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Occasional overuse of adverbial dilution ("shyly loud") and abstract pairings ("ironic awe") borders on poetic indulgence; original conceits like sorrow-stitched walls avoid cliché but some similes ("frayed like memory edges") verge on familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in practice – plush and time-fragility work together, but dream-hopping machinery remains frustratingly nebulous; brief length amplifies thematic density without sacrificing intellectual engagement.</comment>
