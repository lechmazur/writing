<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is vaguely sketched—trembling and reckless traits are stated but lack emotional grounding. Motivation to confront the past remains abstract; actions (freeing the spider) symbolize redemption but feel conceptually borrowed rather than organically earned through lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels overly compressed. The decision to break the amber resolves too cleanly without earned tension; cause-effect relationships rely on symbolic logic rather than character-driven progression, weakening narrative stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (collapsing cathedral as rebirth motif), with rich sensory details (amber’s scent, spray-can hum), but atmosphere overwhelms character. The timeframe and environment enhance mood but don’t actively propel the protagonist’s internal journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery (phoenix mural, trembling amber) and symbolism (spider as trapped past) are potent. The ending’s emotional resonance is undercut by predictable metaphors, but the thematic connection between ruin and redemption lingers. Subtly layered subtext elevates the work.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional overwrought metaphors (“amber trembling with forgotten memories”) veer into purple prose. Originality in combining cathedral decay with street-art rebirth exists, but some elements (phoenix symbolism) default to cliché. Emotions are shown, but psychological complexity feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres formally but lacks emotional urgency. Assigned elements are present yet unevenly integrated—the cathedral and amber are essential, but the “improbable rumor chains” feel tacked on. Lingers as a poetic vignette but falls short of transcendent impact.</comment>
