<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's traits (necromantic abilities, scuffed cap, movie love) are distinctive but underexplored; motivation to map caves for the colony is clear but lacks psychological depth. The baseball cap symbolizes resilience but isn’t woven into major decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from cave entry to revelation, but the word limit leaves some transitions rushed. The "dominate" action drives exploration logically, though the resolution feels abrupt; movies-as-cipher lacks mechanical explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Crystalline cave’s visual and auditory details (glowing veins, machinery hum) are vivid but functional, not fully exploiting the setting’s metaphorical potential. Atmosphere blends cold precision with cinematic nostalgia, though emotional resonance is muted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echoing movies create haunting imagery and thematic parallels (art vs. science, memory vs. progress). Subtext about mapping as both creative and utilitarian act resonates, but emotional payoff is muted by clinical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés via unique fusion (necromancer/historian), though "futuristic nostalgia" strains toward novelty. Movie motifs occasionally dip into generic sentimentality; scarred comet-shaped forehead feels overdesigned but not hollow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements cohesively but unevenly—the shared movie ritual and crystal-as-medium concepts elevate it beyond formulaic sci-fantasy, though some ideas (sound of resolve) lack payoff.</comment>
