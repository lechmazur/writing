<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character inconsistently blends traits; motivation is present but underexplored. The paradox of "impulsively thoughtful" is underdeveloped despite repeated references.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Element utilization is competent but unevenâ€”setting and charcoal shine while social upheaval remains a distant rumble rather than narrative engine.</comment>
