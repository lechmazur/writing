<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped character with unclear psychology; traits like "kindly" feel superficial while "loyally disloyal" is stated but lacks behavioral foundation or emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No tangible plot progression; cyclical atmospheric vignette sustains mood but lacks momentum, tension, or structural payoff within its limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly surreal atmosphere with evocative tactile details ("chairs cradling sighs") and interconnected spatial logic between contrasting settings create immersive, dreamlike cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Strained originality through excessive metaphor-layering creates impressionistic surface but lacks human-scale authenticity; tonal consistency outweighs derivative existential pondering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Strikingly visual but conceptually fragmented; many assigned elements operate independently rather than synthesizing into a unified narrative organism despite inventive imagery.</comment>
