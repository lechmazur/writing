<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are present but thin; introspection relies too heavily on abstract descriptors rather than embodied behavior, weakening emotional connection despite poetic consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot executes a complete arc but feels compressed; key actions (locker discovery, serum use) lack sufficient setup or obstacle, weakening narrative tension despite strong thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently integrated; sensory details overwhelm setting functionality—medical bay's history remains underexplored despite ghostly imagery anchoring tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism ("universe's song," flowering redemption) elevates impact; theme of breaking oppressive silence resonates through layered metaphor and cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on ornate abstraction ("melancholy lullaby") that occasionally feels artificial; emotional beats border on declamatory rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic cohesion exists, but overreliance on metaphor dilutes urgency; tightness of focus clashes with thematic ambition, leaving resolution feeling abrupt despite lyrical beauty.</comment>
