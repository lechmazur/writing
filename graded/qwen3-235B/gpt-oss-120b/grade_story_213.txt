<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations feel abstract rather than grounded in tangible personality. Assigned attribute of "dutiful" shapes routine but not inner conflict or meaningful growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually ambitious but structurally disjointed. Assigned action (destroy) drives the climax, but cause-effect logic between clip snapping and algae reaction feels contrived. Pacing alternates between rushed and meandering.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting elements (lab/restaurant) juxtaposed effectively for initial contrast but fail to merge cohesively. Sensory details (chlorophyll scent, clatter as drumbeat) work but cannot sustain atmospheric unity between disparate locations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (sunrise/algae) creates memorable thematic resonance. However, emotional impact diluted by underdeveloped character stakes and uneven narrative tension. Imagery occasionally veers into overwritten abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but relies on abstract metaphors ("primal sophistication") rather than concrete originality. Prose shows stylistic flair but contains artificial-seeming phrasing ("chaotic chorus of wedding toasts") and inconsistent emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements function more as decorative props than narrative essentials. Style occasionally elevates cohesion but cannot fully reconcile disparate concepts (science/ritual, lab/restaurant) into a unified whole within the constrained format.</comment>
