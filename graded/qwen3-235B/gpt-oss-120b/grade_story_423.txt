<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; motivation is clear but lacks psychological nuance or moral conflict despite poetic descriptions of his nostalgia and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic structure but feels overly compressed; celestial alignment climax works conceptually, though the resolution lacks narrative depth due to length constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere through visceral details (glass scars, melting ice) and temporal contrasts between frozen permanence and rebirth; setting itself acts as metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyricism elevates thematic resonance about impermanence and memory; metaphors (fire as hope, tears as constellations) create layered meaning; ending achieves elegiac circularity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some overwritten imagery ("canvas of life painted in constellations") borders on pretentious, but the central conceit (astronomical mapping as alchemy) feels inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Highly stylized prose masks minor structural fissures; elements integrate tightly into symbolic framework but occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity.</comment>
