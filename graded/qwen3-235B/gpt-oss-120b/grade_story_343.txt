<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth despite atmospheric presence; motivations feel symbolic rather than emotionally grounded. The melancholy reads more as aesthetic choice than behavioral imperative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear symbolic arc undermined by abrupt mystical resolution. Ritualistic actions propel narrative but mechanical cause-effect logic feels strained (steam engine responding to whispers).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visceral steampunk details (clanging bells, humid ink) create immersion but timeframe constraint (paint drying) feels artificially imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (tea leaves=map, crew=meshing gears) but message-heavy delivery weakens subtext. Ending sacrifices ambiguity for declarative statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ironic tension between mechanical environment and humanist ritual shows ingenuity, but some phrasing veers into ornamental abstraction ("copper panels, drying slowly as the vessel creaked") that risks obscuring narrative logic.</comment>
