<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is partially obscured by abstraction; inner conflict is hinted but thinly developed, with hesitation and resolve feeling more symbolic than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but feel compressed; the crab metaphor catalyzes change abruptly, sacrificing depth for brevity, while the ending’s thematic payoff lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but unevenly focused; the tundra/orchard contrast and vapor imagery create haunting visuals, yet sensory details occasionally prioritize mood over plot relevance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels imposed; ideas orbiting tradition vs. adaptation are clear, but brevity flattens potential complexity, leaving thematic undertones underexplored.</comment>
