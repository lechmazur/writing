<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations feel underexplored despite atmospheric presence. Actions and traits (indifferent enthusiasm, role as social media exorcist) remain surface-level with no revealed emotional stakes or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression follows a ritualistic sequence but lacks narrative tension. Resolution feels abrupt and circular rather than climactic, with cause-effect relationships weakened by underdeveloped stakes despite tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compelling sensory details create immersive decay and liminal spaces, but the timeframe reference to the music hall’s final chord feels disconnected from the plot’s momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric use of "quietly loud" and paradoxical imagery (social media/ghosts, mundane/sacred) elevate the narrative. Ending’s unresolved tension lingers, though emotional connection remains distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise is undermined by clichéd "haunted relic" tropes and overused phrases like "whispers of the dead." Sensory details occasionally verge on purple prose; emotional resonance relies heavily on atmospheric implication rather than earned impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic interdependence—secrets clubs and timeframe could be swapped without major disruption. Style serves atmosphere but occasionally obscures character and narrative clarity.</comment>
