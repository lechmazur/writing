<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has vivid traits and clear motivation, but lacks emotional depth or credible internal conflict to justify transformation. The social pull and coy aggression are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with logical cause-effect, but the rapid transition from puzzle-solving to ending feels compressed. Some gaps in how character interactions with elements drive progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Excellent sensory details create an immersive, thematically resonant atmosphere where dance and mysticism intertwine. Some setting elements (e.g., jasmine scent) feel slightly overstylized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with fresh metaphors (e.g., "incantations merged with scientific readings") and thematic subtext. Ending sacrifices emotional resonance for poetic abstraction slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nuanced handling of tone and original concept integration, though occasional ornate descriptions and the exorcist archetype border on formulaic. The dance-science fusion demonstrates ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Cohesive despite many required elements, though some (facility) feel functional rather than essential. The ending provides thematic closure while suggesting broader implications about epistemology.</comment>
