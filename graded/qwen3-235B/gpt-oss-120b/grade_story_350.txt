<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's vague restlessness drives the plot but lacks depth; motivation to 'uncover hidden truth' remains abstract, unsupported by meaningful emotional shading or personal stakes beyond surface obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structure follows clear quest narrative but compresses logic-defying steps (album transformation, stair descent) without grounding causal connections; ending feels abrupt despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stylish sensory details create haunting atmosphere, but temple's cultural weight remains superficial; connection between setting and central symbols (album, gown) feels largely decorative rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Luminous metaphors and tactile symbolism elevate the prose; theme of truth-as-experience resonates, though 'truth as feeling' resolution feels philosophically undercooked despite poetic delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overuse of compound adjectives and metaphor clusters ('symphonies of truth', 'dying moth riddles') veers toward self-indulgent excess; concept hinges on surreal logic but struggles to balance originality and coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Compelling imagery outweighs structural awkwardness; elevated style suggests literary ambition, but uneven execution leaves some assigned elements feeling like checklist items rather than narrative necessities.</comment>
