<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like arrogance and "doubtful confidence" are stated rather than fully dramatized; motivations tied to "shackled potential" feel abstract, with transformation resolution relying on poetic gesture over psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—the song’s abrupt introduction disrupts momentum, and the pivotal tapestry-cutting resolution feels condensed, lacking escalation; symbolic logic is present but conceptually hurried.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (ink, lacquer, bamboo rustle) immerse effectively, but the "harsh tenderness" tone occasionally veers into vague juxtaposition without sustained emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "protective bruise of arrogance") and layered imagery enhance thematic resonance; subtext about humility vs. hubris is engaging, though some emotional beats rely on abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imaginative use of symbols avoids triteness, but phrases like "thin ribbon of light" flirt with overfamiliarity; emotional shifts lean on lyrical description rather than organic character behavior, slightly undercutting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive metaphorical framework, but the brevity strains narrative depth; the ending suggests depth but leaves thematic threads more implied than earned.</comment>
