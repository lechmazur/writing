<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "blunt" and "enthusiastically cautious" are stated more than demonstrated through specific actions; motivation to protect secrets is clear but feels abstract, with limited emotional resonance or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The battle-as-coding conceit drives momentum, but the logic of the method (ticker codes as weapons) lacks internal consistency; the arc is complete but resolution feels abrupt, with cause-effect gaps in how the puzzle is solved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery (cracked doorways, humming shelves) is undercut by inconsistent sensory details; the temple-cum-library’s spiritual tone clashes with the anachronistic stock ticker, diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like the teddy bear’s "stitched smile widening" and the ticker as a battlefield create symbolic depth; the theme of resistance against omniscience is compelling but underdeveloped, leaning on poetic phrasing more than earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attempting fresh fusion of occult and financial motifs but strays into purple prose ("holographic chessboard of equations"); avoids clichés in tone but relies on predictable "lone hero vs. omniscient mind" tropes; emotional beats are often stated ("anxious elation") rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the teddy bear and stock ticker hint at creativity but strain suspension of disbelief; the ending lacks lingering impact, resolving too neatly for such a high-concept premise; the temple’s revival feels underexplored.</comment>
