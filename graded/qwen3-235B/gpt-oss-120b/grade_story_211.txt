<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is symbolic rather than deeply realized; motivation expressed through external actions more than internal logic. Defiant tone remains abstract rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure leans into surrealism, creating cohesive atmosphere more than plot. Cause-effect between confessions and diary's transformation remains vaguely implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting becomes abstract symbolism rather than visceral space. Ghost town atmosphere feels inconsistent—haunted schoolhouse details vivid but urban decay framework never materializes beyond vague decay descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphor density (botanical decay/power corruption, laughter as confetti) creates profound thematic resonance. Subtext about hope commodification through symbolic duplication remains intellectually satisfying despite abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Language avoids clichés with original metaphors ("whispers as roulette glass"), but leans on lyrical intensity that borders on purple prose without fully crossing. Emotional tone emerges through atmosphere rather than character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Element integration uneven despite strong central conceit. Conceptual cohesion exists in theoretical exploration of power's duplicability, but practical execution relies too heavily on poetic abstraction rather than narrative mechanics.</comment>
