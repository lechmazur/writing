<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Inventor's motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; fatigue is stated rather than demonstrated through mannerisms or decisions beyond relentless focus.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot momentum stalls between activation and resolution; cause-effect of DNA-spliced resonance lacks explanatory logic but maintains structural unity within compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Neon orchard's synesthetic details immerse effectively; however, cyberpunk underworld remains superficially sketched compared to its transformative role in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose achieves visceral impact; the motif of "shame-as-invisible-barriers" and subtextual rebellion/identity themes resonate through resonant imagery rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Challenging genre norms with "singularly plural" paradox but often teeters into overwrought phrasing; DNA splicing and neon orchard lean on sci-fi shorthand rather than distinctive invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements superficially coherent but occasionally strain credibility; the brass bell and DNA method exhibit ingenuity, but shame-as-physical-force concept requires greater philosophical grounding.</comment>
