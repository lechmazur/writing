<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is well-established, but the transformation feels concise rather than deeply nuanced; motivation is clear but could benefit from more textured reactions to the flute's discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot's progression from exploration to revelation feels purposeful, but the tight constraints leave some transitions (e.g., seed research yielding immediate results) underdeveloped; the ending achieves thematic closure but rushes the societal impact of the language revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical descriptions of the archive and crypt immerse the reader in a haunting atmosphere; the extinct symbols etched on urban and organic surfaces create cohesive visual motifs that enhance the mystical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (music as "seedlings pushing through cracked stone") and layered themes of performative identity vs. authenticity elevate the prose; the ending's juxtaposition of "calm fury" crystallizes the subtext effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in merging fortune-telling with academic discovery, but some phrases ("whispers of forgotten syllables") veer toward familiar mystical tropes; emotional beats are shown rather than stated but occasionally lean on poetic abstraction over specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion despite the packed elements, though the planting timeframe remains ambiguously integrated; the ending's reflection on risk-averse scholarship lingers, but the story occasionally prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum.</comment>
