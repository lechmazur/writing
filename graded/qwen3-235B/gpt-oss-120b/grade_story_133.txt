<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Corin’s jadedness is stated but underdeveloped; his transformation feels abrupt. Mara’s motivation ties to the test but lacks depth. Dialogue reveals some character but remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot moves via poetic imagery over logical progression. Pacing drags in the pottery class scene, rushes the climax. Connection between Corin’s locks and the throne lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Richly textured setting with vivid sensory details (pine, iron, apples), though the colonial town’s mechanics feel abstract. Atmosphere supports the theme but occasionally leans on exoticism over internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (locks as memory, throne as synthesis) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. Ending evokes emotional weight but leaves central themes underexplored, sacrificing thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by generic descriptors (“delightfully menacing”) and contrived elements (pottery class as plot catalyst). Sensory details avoid purple prose but occasionally prioritize ornamentation over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>Ideas are unevenly synthesized; the throne’s significance feels imposed rather than earned. Some elegant prose, but the story leans on atmosphere to mask underdeveloped themes and contrived plot mechanics.</comment>
