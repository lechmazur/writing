<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's selflessness and musical focus are clear but lack emotional depth; motivations drive the plot, but inner conflicts/nuance are minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on poetic abstraction over narrative momentum; conflict resolution via sound feels abrupt, undermining structural cohesion in the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., humming steel, mismatched chimes) enhances the story’s melancholic tone and cosmic scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and existential themes (connection, legacy) resonate, but abstract resolution of conflict weakens emotional payoff despite strong imagery and subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but undermined by intermittent purple prose and repetitive cosmic metaphors; transformation of greed into awe feels overly simplistic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are thematically cohesive and poetic, but abstract execution risks superficiality; the story’s brevity enhances its mythic tone but limits narrative depth.</comment>
