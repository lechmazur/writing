<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (escaping violence) is poetically stated but lacks psychological depth; actions (gardening, collecting shards) symbolize redemption but remain abstracted from visceral inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses quietly via symbolic acts (planting, receiving letter), but lacks narrative tension or resolution; structure feels static within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered (moss, rust, cherry petals) but occasionally prioritizes style over plot-forwarding details; setting becomes a character but risks overwhelming narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (shards as redemption, seed as hope) are evocative, though emotional beats rely heavily on poetic abstraction rather than earned resonance; ending is thematically resonant but underpinned by passivity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in blending Eastern and Western archetypes (monk/lawman) and metaphoric layering; some diction (“corroded rapture”) teeters toward ornate abstraction, diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through recurring symbols, but story leans on poetic conceits over narrative urgency; potential for depth is hinted but under-realized due to length and stylistic density.</comment>
