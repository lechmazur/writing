<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's gloominess is atmospheric but underdeveloped; motivation (craftsman's pride) lacks emotional depth despite being stated. Actions align with desire to "contain" lullabies, but internal conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear retrieval-and-revelation arc, but pacing feels compressed in mid-section (e.g., abrupt transaction). Resonance concept drives coherent cause-and-effect, though the black-market deal lacks narrative weight beyond exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Imagery evokes decay and artificiality, but resonance testing facility feels underutilized as a setting (its mechanics are plot-essential but narratively inert). Sensory details are poetic but occasionally overwrought ("machines sound like prayers").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("sap through veins," "orchard's branches swaying to cradle songs") elevate theme of memory-as-life-force. Ending resonates emotionally, though relies slightly on "forgotten mother" trope. Subtext about commodifying beauty is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing but leans on ornate descriptors ("haggard awe," "crystalline tone") that occasionally border on pretentiousness. Metaphors are fresh but occasionally overcooked. Emotional subtext emerges through imagery, not just declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted (black-market transaction feels procedural; "past meets prophecy" motif lacks payoff). Themes of artifice vs. authenticity resonate, but storytelling clarity slightly hinders broader impact.</comment>
