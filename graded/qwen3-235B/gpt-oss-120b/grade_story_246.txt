<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but shallowly developed; Eli's identity as a conspiracy theorist informs his curiosity but lacks psychological depth, leaving reactions to supernatural elements feeling scripted rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a functional arc, but the phone's dying battery as a ritual trigger feels contrived within the word limit; cause-effect logic hinges on arbitrary technical details rather than organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "humming sky" and "glowing handkerchief" create vivid, cohesive atmosphere; the magnetic anomaly's influence on setting enhances the eerie tone without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., polymerizing grief into strength) add thematic depth, and the cosmic scale symbolism is striking, but emotional resonance suffers from overtly stated insights rather than subtle character embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "polymerize" conceit is inventive, but generational curse tropes and attic-letter discovery lean on genre conventions; atmospheric precision and magnetic anomaly blending resist formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Satisfying closure on the surface (broken curse, resolved tension), but thematic and emotional layers feel abbreviated; the required elements integrate successfully yet prioritize mysticism over human-scale consequence.</comment>
