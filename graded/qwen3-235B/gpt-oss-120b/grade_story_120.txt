<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Psychological depth over character arc; motivation is abstractly profound but lacks tangible behavior shifts. The lure’s symbolic weight compensates for limited interaction with others.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ethereal progression replaces traditional plot; repetitive stasis undercuts momentum. Resolution feels conceptually earned but structurally abrupt, straining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel’s surreal texture amplifies existential dissonance. Multisensory details (neon, bells, rust) immerse, though scientific plausibility isn’t pursued.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden tapestry transcends gimmickry; the lure as trauma-keepsake and “nesting” as coping ritual offer rich subtext. Ending synthesizes theme with quiet catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in trauma-as-quantum-loop metaphor; avoids time-loop clichés. Some abstract phrasing risks pretension, but emotional authenticity undercuts excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Hypnotic cohesion between theme & device, but tension between lyrical prose and narrative minimalism may alienate. Lingers as poetic riddle more than story.</comment>
