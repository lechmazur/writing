<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbols than people; Maraâ€™s "assertively meek" trait is stated but not fully dramatized through specific psychological depth or decisions. The traveler remains a passive cipher.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot relies on poetic juxtaposition over cause-effect logic; the tapestry-as-key feels abstract, undermining narrative urgency. Pacing lags in middle but ends with a forced, saccharine resolution that dissolves tension prematurely.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid desert-tech contrast (e.g., "amber heat," "solar drones like fireflies") but sensory details occasionally lapse into ornamentation without character connection or thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (tapestry as analog to data, mirage as digital unreality) elevate the theme, but over-reliance on symbolic abstraction dilutes emotional immersion and reduces tension to didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Excessive ornament ("desperate optimism...a drum") and overused tech anxiety tropes (digital mazes) clash with undercooked elements like "xenialize." Subtext feels telegraphed, not nuanced through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists superficially, but the story leans on aesthetic density over structural rigor. The brief length sacrifices character agency for metaphor, leaving a polished but thin emotional core.</comment>
