<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes; Milo's trustworthiness and Lira's island memories remain underexplored, lacking emotional stakes. Their shared secret lacks psychological nuance despite plot significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear engineering arc but transitions feel abrupt—particularly the lattice activation. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the emotional payoff struggles to surpass functional progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory fragments (ozone, chipped cards) create atmosphere but worldbuilding strains under inconsistent temporal logic—how exactly do videotape memories connect to a physical blueprint fragment?</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metallic textures of "copper spirals" vs. organic island imagery achieve thematic tension. Ending's philosophical resonance feels earned through cumulative sensory metaphor, though subtlety risks diluting emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some passages shine with controlled lyricism, but AI hallmarks surface: Blueprint as "top-secret" trope, overly symmetrical duality between characters. Emotional beats occasionally state rather than dramatize.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Competent cohesion between assigned elements, but lacks transcendent innovation. The lattice metaphor works thematically yet feels like a conceptual MacGuffin rather than narrative revelation.</comment>
