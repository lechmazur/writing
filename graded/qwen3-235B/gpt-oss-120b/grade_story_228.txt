<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psychological depth; motivation ("not enough") is emotionally abstract but lacks tangible connection to Mara's personal history or tangible stakes beyond generalized scarcity themes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tightly paced but relies heavily on metaphorical resonance over plot mechanics; the storm-to-turbine sequence strains plausibility within the genre's logic but effectively serves thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through industrial decay textures (concrete, rain reflections) and scent-driven symbolism; but the government bunker's function remains undercontextualized despite its narrative centrality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (clothespin as revolutionary tool) elevates basic plot; the kinetic energy conversion scene merges technical ingenuity and poetic resonance to create lingering emotional afterimage.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s in structural conceits but often defaults to overexplained symbolism ("tension in chest loosening"); storm descriptions occasionally border on portentousness despite original core concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration prioritizes thematic cohesion over naturalism; the clothespin's mechanical role stretches credibility but anchors the story's thematic scaffolding with memorable specificity.</comment>
