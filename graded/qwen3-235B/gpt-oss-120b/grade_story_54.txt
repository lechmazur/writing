<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's systematically rebellious nature is hinted but not deeply explored; her conflict between old and new methods is clear but could use more emotional depth; voice is distinct but lacks nuanced introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on abrupt connections (e.g., pulsars guiding offloading lacks cause-effect logic); pacing uneven in moments but resolves efficiently within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details, but some imagery (e.g., "nebula hum") feels arbitrarily inserted, weakening coherence between setting and cosmic elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cathedral of forgotten wishes" and the scarf as a sentient artifact elevate the narrative; subtext about tradition vs. innovation resonates, though emotional resonance is occasionally diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in combining sci-fi and carnival surrealism, but repetitive phrases ("vibrations of intent") and overly ornate descriptions risk formulaic patterns; tension between Mara and the implied empire is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and memorable, though some elements (e.g., nebula hum) feel imposed; the fusion of tech and myth sparks discussion but lacks anchoring stakes.</comment>
