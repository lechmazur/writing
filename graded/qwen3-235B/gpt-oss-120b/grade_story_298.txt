<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's unique traits (chameleon actor, tattered dress) inform actions, but emotional depth and voice consistency falter under scrutiny. Motivation aligns with traits but lacks human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with poetic climax, but resolution feels overly neat. Pacing struggles slightly under compression; some cause-effect connections could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid visual atmosphere contrasts ancient and post-oil worlds effectively, but worldbuilding remains surface-level. Atmospheric details lack integration with character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness elevates the piece; emotional resonance emerges through layered imagery rather than direct statement. Ending achieves thematic closure with symbolic transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s with surreal elements and hybrid setting, but occasionally relies on abstract phrases ("anxious serenity") that feel conceptual rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements serve cohesive thematic purpose, though some (oil extraction) remain underdeveloped. Story feels intentionally distilled rather than constrained, leaving intellectual/ emotional resonance.</comment>
