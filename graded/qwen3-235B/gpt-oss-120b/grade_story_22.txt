<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Complex character with layered motivations; Mara's sarcasm and secret belief in the myth add depth, but sudden tonal shifts near resolution weaken cohesion of her evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but the stew's role in dismantling the portal feels underdeveloped. The ending resolution is conceptually strong but rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Portals and carvings create vivid atmosphere, but the blend of mythic timelessness with specific details like lentil stew creates tonal inconsistencies in sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor ("tasting the offering") and subtext about humility over fame. Dialogue natural yet thematically purposeful. Ending's thematic resonance elevates craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids most AI traps: sarcasm-as-theme prevents clich√©s; stew as transformative agent borders on arbitrary but gains meaning through repetition. Purple prose minimized despite rich description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive exploration of legacy. Ending's lentil token provides resonant throughline. Tight length complements mythic scope rather than limiting it.</comment>
