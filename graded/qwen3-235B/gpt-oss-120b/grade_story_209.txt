<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (mapping railways to save towns) is clear, but his psychological depth is thinly implied through abstract metaphors rather than authentic behavior. The confession about selling the hairbrush feels emotionally significant but lacks concrete backstory to anchor its weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a redemption arc, but the logic of how echo-measurement translates to mapping, and how honesty directly affects the radio garden, remains obscure. Pacing veers from poetic linger to abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels in sensory fragments—the humming garden, fractured frequencies—but the setting’s internal logic (e.g., hospital monitors’ influence) strains coherence. Atmosphere enhances theme, yet feels prioritized over functional world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholic wonder and redemption through striking imagery/symbolism (hairbrush as spiritual compass), though emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction over nuanced humanization. Ending resonates thematically but feels slightly preordained rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story avoids genre tropes but occasionally indulges in ornate prose ("cheer that trembled like a wind-chime"). Metaphors are inventive but occasionally overwrought; character psychology leans on archetypes over specific human contradictions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Cohesion exists at a thematic level, but elements strain under precise scrutiny (e.g., why water tower resonance maps railways?). Style elevates beyond cliché but sacrifices some narrative clarity. Lingering resonance is aesthetic more than emotional.</comment>
