<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's uncertainty and motive to map cloud-veiled trails are present but underexplored; her internal conflict about immortality hints at depth but lacks nuanced reactions that would make her decisions feel earned rather than narratively imposed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc within tight limits: the market's impending verdict drives tension; glyph-revealing scene serves as structural pivot. Pacing is deliberate, though the ending’s thematic shift risks feeling abrupt without deeper emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid floating market imagery anchors atmosphere, but "mundane miracles" are unevenly rendered (self-boiling kettle feels forced). Sensory details (humming scale, glowing glyphs) enhance mystery but rarely evoke lived-in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic language avoids cliché with fresh metaphors (e.g., "garden of ordinary wonders"). The scale measuring a decision rather than a soul subverts trope expectations. Ending resonates through symbolic action rather than explicit resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases lean on lush descriptors ("kaleidoscope of hot air balloons") but avoid overwhelming. Minor shifts in glyph explanation feel procedural, yet the forest-as-veins conceit shows inventiveness. Subverts "price of immortality" by weighing choice over sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elegant prose and philosophical weight save coherence from thin character context. Assigned elements often feel mandatory rather than organically discovered, though the scale’s dual role as tool and symbolic object demonstrates clever integration.</comment>
