<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than developed; motivation feels externally imposed rather than organically revealed through actions. Passive detachment undermines emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but relies on poetic abstraction over logical progression. Collage method lacks concrete stakes or consequences, making plot feel arbitrary despite lyrical momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive details create a distinctive cyberpunk-organic hybrid atmosphere. Some elements (metal breathing?) risk becoming distracting conceits rather than meaningful worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical texture and thematic resonance about human/nature connection, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending feels more mystical than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding undercut by occasional purple prose and emotionally detached tone that veers into affectlessness. Conceptual freshness diluted by abstract delivery mechanisms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through atmospheric consistency rather than structural rigor. Ambiguous triumph leaves lingering questions about thematic payoff versus stylistic excess.</comment>
