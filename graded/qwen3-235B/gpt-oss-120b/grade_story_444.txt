<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s fierceness is stated but not consistently demonstrated through actions; motivation to “hush illusions” lacks psychological depth; reactions to objects/concepts (e.g., ghost costume) imply a symbolic role but lack personal stakes or emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear conflict or resolution; planting letters drives action but lacks narrative urgency; connection between beginning and end is symbolic rather than structural; pacing feels elongated within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting’s surreal qualities (sunken zeppelin, radio static) create evocative atmosphere, but temporal framing and sensory details are inconsistent; tone oscillates without anchoring to the story’s conceptual goals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and thematically resonant, but emotional impact is undercut by abstraction; metaphors (e.g., “calm frenzy”) intrigue but lack payoff; ending poses philosophical questions without earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery avoids cliché but occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction; metaphors (e.g., letters as chess moves) feel strained; emotional subtext is hinted at but not deeply explored; style prioritizes texture over narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story’s poetic ambitions are evident but unevenly realized; elements serve atmosphere more than narrative; thematic coherence is diluted by excessive abstraction; leaves lingering questions but not necessarily meaningful ones.</comment>
