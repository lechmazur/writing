<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations obscured by poetic abstraction rather than specific humanized drives. Moral ambiguity hinted but not critically explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression but relies on surrealism over cause-effect; vignette structure sacrifices emotional resolution. Pacing uneven in key transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hyper-specific imagery (xerograph, tower) disrupts setting cohesion. Sensory details mesmerize but fail to ground the world in internal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (seed packets as cryptic maps) and thematic resonance around collective memory impress, though emotional impact diluted by narrative ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with xerograph/seed packet interplay, but lyrical excess risks obscuring clarity. Subtext feels intentional but inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but unevenly executed; atmospheric elements overpower narrative cohesion, making thematic undercurrents feel strained rather than organic.</comment>
