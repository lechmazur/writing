<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; traits mentioned but not demonstrated through meaningful choices. The brother's reference feels superficial, failing to anchor Mara's motivation or rebel identity in tangible emotions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arch of discovery but lacks narrative propulsion. The transition between scenes feels passive; the "call that changes fate" is underexploited as a plot device, resolving too abstractly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting delivers immersive sensory detail ("cracked mirrors," "chandelier of broken glass") and complements the ephemeral gloom tone. However, atmospheric richness doesn't fully integrate with character or concept—haunted elements remain decorative rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("broth a bridge," "adaptation...turning fear into flavor") elevate craft but unevenly land—some lines veer toward cloying abstraction. Final image of the bowl as a comet suggests thematic resonance, though theme execution remains undercoached.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality undercut by overused tropes (haunted house, mystical ramen). Similes like "tears that felt like laughter" and "perpetual dance between loss and flavor" lean precious. Emotional beats often asserted rather than earned through nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are unevenly fused—pocket knife adaptation mechanic feels literal rather than symbolic; ramen-as-motivator lacks connective tissue to Mara's 'rebel' identity. Conceptual framework shows ambition but insufficient narrative payoff.</comment>
