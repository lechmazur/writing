<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s reincarnated identity and guilt are psychologically resonant but inconsistently threaded; key traits (e.g., "tentatively fierce") lack nuanced behavioral grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc is cohesive but structurally uneven—the sudden weather shift feels contrived, while the resolution hinges on underdeveloped stakes (doctor’s chart).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gothic atmosphere and tactile sensory details (cracked windows, bitter kelp) immerse readers, though the hybrid setting’s rules (recipe library’s metaphysics) remain ambiguously defined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("tiny mirrors of redemption") and symbolic object placement elevate the narrative; the dissolution of the soldier’s arm achieves visceral catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through surreal juxtaposition; the inciting "sudden change of weather" strains credulity but serves thematic momentum without feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious concept density; the doctor’s chart subplot feels extraneous, diluting the transcendent conclusion’s emotional resonance.</comment>
