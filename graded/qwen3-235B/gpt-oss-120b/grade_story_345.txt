<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (defying fate) is present but underdeveloped; internal conflict is hinted but lacks emotional texture. The lapsed priest’s voice lacks distinctiveness, relying on abstract introspection over tangible thoughts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear arc (complacency to rebellion) exists, but the pivotal transition into the upward corridor feels rushed. Snow patterns drive the narrative, yet the cause-effect between the pebble placement and the orchard’s response lacks clarity, muddying the climactic shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through “dull radiance” and bean-stalk arches, but sensory depth is uneven—visual details dominate, while tactile/auditory elements (e.g., rustling stalks, abacus texture) are underexploited. The timelessness of “fate unraveling” detracts from grounded immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic coherence (abacus as fractured faith, snow as shifting destiny) and thematic richness about agency vs. stagnation. The prayer of thanks for courage—not redemption—avoids cliché. Occasional over-reliance on abstract phrasing (“whispers of the orchard”) slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in using jogging as a spiritual act, but the bean-stalk labyrinth feels overly familiar. The abacus/snow combo is inventive, yet phrasing like “price of complacency pressed like missing beads” borders on redundant. Emotion is shown through action (pebble placement), but some metaphors (“void”/”voids”) recur excessively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a cohesive parable-like narrative, though the beanstalks and snow patterns verge on whimsy. The self-contained arc works within the word limit, but the ending’s transcendence feels abrupt rather than earned. The tone lingers, but thematic resonance is unevenly sustained.</comment>
