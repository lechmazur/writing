<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s sea-worn status and intensity are visually rendered but lack psychological depth; motivations tied to abstract "guiding others" feel underexplored despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has formal coherence but sacrifices narrative momentum; the ladder’s metaphorical function strains logic, and the abrupt audience reaction shift feels mechanically inserted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest’s phosphorescent imagery and the theater’s dust motes create visceral, dreamlike immersion that enhances the story’s contemplative mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (ladder as memory, fire as revelation) are evocative and thematically resonant, though some phrasing ("set reason ablaze") leans on familiar poetic templates without reinvention.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original imagery (bioluminescent ink, shifting colors) counterbalances occasional purple prose; the ladder-rung-as-memory mechanic avoids cliché but strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story coheres conceptually but leans too heavily on lush description at the expense of emotional urgency; individual elements work but their synthesis lacks friction.</comment>
