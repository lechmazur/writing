<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but lacks nuanced reactions or emotional complexity; motivation is clear but underexplored beyond surface-level exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sufficient structural coherence with clear beginning/middle/end, but progression feels engineered rather than earned through character-driven causality; multiverse element strains logical pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in underwater setting achieved through evocative marine decay metaphors; some over-adorned descriptions risk atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery-rich prose carries thematic weight about commerce's cost, but emotional resonance undercut by explicitly stated feelings; ending's metaphor lands well.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through saltwater botany and bureaucratic ghosts, but "trustworthy unique" framing and phantom hand device feel algorithmically generated rather than organically symbolic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Imaginative premise successfully merges all elements technically, but fails to transcend compilation of parts into transcendent whole; surface thematic unity masks underdeveloped philosophical stakes.</grade>
