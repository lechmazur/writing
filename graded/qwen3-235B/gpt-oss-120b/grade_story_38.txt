<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and passive; insomniac trait lacks functional integration into his psychology or decisions. Motivation for non-violence feels imposed rather than organically connected to actions, which lean on symbolic gestures without clear emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot meanders through atmospheric moments without strong forward momentum; the transition from subway to attic to revelation lacks causal logic. The ending attempts thematic resonance but feels abrupt and under-earned within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (dust, cold drafts, plant scents) that evoke haunting stillness, but the "haunted attic" and subway settings remain atmospheric containers rather than active forces shaping the narrative or character choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphoric richness (e.g., ink as dripping vines) provide emotional texture, while the vague, cyclical structure undermines concrete thematic impact. Subtext about quiet resistance is present but inconsistently embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Imaginative phrasing ("meticulously messy strokes") contrasts with clich√©d elements like whispered warnings and drunken revelations. Some sensory details shine, but the poet's voice often blends into abstract, affectless introspection typical of formulaic lyrical writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially: botanical samples and subway stops contribute to atmosphere, but method (drunken confessions), attic's haunted quality, and "empty abundance" feel forced. Themes are stated rather than dramatized, weakening cohesion.</comment>
