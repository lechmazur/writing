<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits are conceptually integrated but lack emotional complexity; motivations are poetic yet underexplored. Distinct voice exists but feels more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative flows logically but lacks tension; ends abruptly. Time-folding and rotary phone propulsion are conceptually coherent but structurally underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive setting with rich tactile details (concrete, rust, graffiti). "Time folding" enhances atmosphere but is underutilized as a structural device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric language ("beauty is a circuit") and layered subtext. Sensory imagery creates profound emotional resonance without explicit sentiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original metaphors (fractured light as storytelling) elevate beyond clich√©. Some abstract phrasing risks vagueness, but overall style remains inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements form an aesthetically cohesive whole but with varying narrative necessity. Time-folding feels tacked on rather than integral. Leaves reflective questions rather than loose ends.</comment>
