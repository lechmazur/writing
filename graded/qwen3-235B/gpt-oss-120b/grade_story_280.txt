<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character relies too heavily on abstract descriptors; motivations inferred through plot mechanics rather than internal logic; voice lacks distinctiveness; interactions with objects feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot momentum falters from compressed scale; cause/effect between bear, quasars, and strategy lacks organic escalation; abrupt tonal shifts between cosmic and practical undercut cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Strained worldbuilding blends incompatible elements (quasars/beekeeping) without resolving their narrative gravity; atmospheric details prioritize abstract metaphor over sensory immersion; some imagery overwhelms functional purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric scaffolding (strategy as dough, animal tracks as galactic patterns) creates intellectual resonance; poetic rhythm elevates thematic symmetry; emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction and lack of grounded humanity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Linguistic ingenuity in combining sci-fi with rural motifs is undercut by overwritten passages (e.g., "golden glow mingle with quasarâ€™s pulse"); emotional beats stated rather than evinced through consequence; over-reliance on cosmic-personal parallels.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; elements function as conceptual scaffolding rather than lived reality; style occasionally obscures emotional engagement; leaves aesthetic fascination but limited visceral imprint.</comment>
