<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's muteness and ventriloquism remain symbolic gestures without psychological depth; optimism feels tacked on, not integrated into concrete actions or conflicts. The dummy as narrative device lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fragmented vignette structure sacrifices coherence; the tourists' role as catalysts feels arbitrary, and the symbolic "flag" conclusion lacks narrative momentum or meaningful transformation within the compressed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric atmosphere with singing tides and static-sparking sand creates vivid immersion; dissonance between human pettiness and cosmic serenity enhances thematic resonance through visceral sensory contrasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like coffee sleeve turned flag show ingenuity, but emotional beats often gesture toward profundity without earning resonance; the ending feels more poetically tidy than thematically earned or intellectually provocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by AI-flavored poetic abstraction (e.g., "barometric spikes matching sky colors"); emotional responses occasionally state rather than show, though worldbuilding resists genre tropes through deliberate strangeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function individually but cohere uneasily; the parallel universe setting and weather archive concept feel underexploited, suggesting a fragile skeleton holding up more ambitious thematic material.</comment>
