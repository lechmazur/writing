<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>R Mara’s profession as a “professional cuddler” is conceptually tied to her prejudice about touch, but her internal conflict lacks concrete grounding in actions or interactions that would make her growth feel earned. The prejudice feels abstract rather than rooted in specific experiences, weakening the emotional resonance of her shift. Her “unusually usual calm” is mentioned but rarely demonstrated through distinct behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>R The plot hinges on Mara’s shift in perspective via the phantom punch, but the structure feels compressed. The farmer’s market encounter and decay-to-starlight metaphor drive the narrative, yet transitions between settings (hangar, market, hangar) are abrupt. Logical connections exist, but pacing missteps and underexplored stakes leave the arc feeling rushed rather than precise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>R The abandoned spaceport’s decayed grandeur and the farmer’s market’s tactile intimacy create a haunting, layered atmosphere. Sensory details (“dust-laden aisles,” “amber light”) are vivid and thematically resonant, though the juxtaposition of sci-fi and rustic elements occasionally strains credibility. The tone’s reverence for “ancient novelty” is well-sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>R Metaphors like “rusted tracks” and “phantom rails” effectively link Mara’s bias to broader themes of connection. The ending’s light cascade is poetic, but emotional beats rely too heavily on abstract imagery rather than character-specific reactions. The central conflict is clear but lacks subtext that might elevate it beyond a standard redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>R The story avoids overt clichés, but phrases like “dust on her shoulders” and the “cathedral” simile lean into familiar poetic gestures. The phantom punch’s legend adds originality, yet Mara’s realization plays predictably into “overcoming prejudice” tropes. The prose aims for lyrical depth but occasionally overreaches, veering into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>R Despite tight constraints, the narrative coheres around its core elements, though the farmer’s market encounter feels contrived. The brevity underscores thematic focus but sacrifices deeper exploration of Mara’s profession and the spaceport’s history. The lingering theme of unspoken barriers is potent, yet the story’s precision feels calculated rather than organic.</comment>
