<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character lacks clear psychological complexity; motivations are hinted through mood but remain abstract and disconnected from concrete actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot meanders; structure exists but forward momentum feels artificial. Climax/resolution are oblique, leaving cause-effect relationships ambiguous despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with immersive, cohesive sensory textures that deepen mood, though its connection to character psychology remains implied rather than explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor elevate craft, but emotional resonance is undercut by diffuse thematic scaffolding and over-reliance on ornamental abstraction over human-scale stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with idiosyncratic metaphors and cohesive tone, though occasional baroque phrasing risks losing emotional authenticity; mostly avoids formulaic AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack narrative urgency; the brief feels obeyed formally, yet emotional or philosophical momentum remains underdeveloped.</comment>
