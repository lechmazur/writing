<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations exist but are surface-level; Mara's "doubts" repeat without deep exploration. Her rational rebellion feels conceptually sound but lacks nuanced internal conflict. The amber brooch reveals imperfect love but isn't sufficiently connected to her relationships with others.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but stretches plausibility with sudden resolutions. The midnight walk's emotional payoff feels rushed, while the mentorship plan's implementation lacks intermediate stakes. The beginning/end connection via the brooch is elegant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chalk cliff colony creates vivid atmosphere with sensory details (resin glow, bell sounds). Timeframe with bells creates eerie timelessness, but the setting's artistic context isn't fully leveraged beyond visual motifs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("bridge not wall" rebellion) and atmospheric consistency create resonance. The ending's "amber sparks" show strong subtext, though some dialogue lacks bite. Theme of imperfect preservation is clearly rendered but slightly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism but occasional purple prose ("cheerful gloom" overemphasized). The lighthouse keeper backstory avoids clich√© but feels slightly formulaic. Emotional resonance built through action, though some motivations (colony's acceptance) remain unexplained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Despite tight word count, elements generally serve thematic cohesion. The colonial setting and amber motif create memorable texture, though interconnected paths feel tacked on. The ending satisfies but doesn't deepen initial tensions.</grade>
