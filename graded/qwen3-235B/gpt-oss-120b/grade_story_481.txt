<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is poetically rendered but lacks psychological depth; Mira's transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through sustained emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; the forge sequence and resolution occur without sufficient narrative breathing room to establish organic cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative yet inconsistent - sterile hospital imagery contrasts beautifully with forge's warmth but fails to fully integrate technological specificity needed for "futuristic" setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose creates strong atmospheric impact and symbolic richness, but emotional beats occasionally border on melodrama rather than earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original setting combinations and strong metaphors ("metal songs") elevate the piece, but character decisions occasionally feel poetically necessary rather than naturally human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion is achieved but precarious; some elements (cartography profession, forge mechanics) strain believability while narrative compression occasionally fractures emotional logic.</comment>
