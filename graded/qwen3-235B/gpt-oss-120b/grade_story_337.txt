<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character exists as a thematic vessel but lacks depth; motivations are present but static, with minimal evolution or emotional complexity. Voice is atmospheric but not distinctly individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from rebellion against algorithms to community impact, but episodic pacing and compressed word count undercut narrative momentum and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shifting glass, jasmine/rust) create immersive duality between high-tech decay and organic tradition. Setting feels like an extension of thematic conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical integration of crack as temporal/emotional bridge elevates theme. Evocative imagery elevates surface narrative. Subtext about tradition/innovation permeates every structural choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through precise metaphors ("reliably-unreliable," "kinked destinies"). Subtle showing of emotional states via tangible reactions (tile-hum, cookie-cracking rituals).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements largely function organically despite constraints, though some feel imposed (chance meetings, curfew framing). Lingering thematic resonance about preserving ineffable human elements survives.</comment>
