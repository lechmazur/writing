<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is superficially present but poorly defined; trauma connections are thematic assertions rather than earned revelations; motivations are stated more than dramatized through distinct behavioral patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but relies on thematic abstraction over concrete plotting; cause/effect relationships work logically but lack visceral urgency; pacing manages brevity but feels compressed rather than naturally condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensorial descriptions (crystal resonance, trembling sand), but setting elements like the scrying room/catacombs feel conceptually underexploited despite vivid presentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (trauma as multiplied sand, lullaby as collective healing) elevate impact, but emotional resonance suffers from overreliance on "showy" abstractions rather than intimate character perspective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (e.g., "luminous veins") occasionally border on overwritten; some phrasing feels self-consciously poetic rather than organically earned, undermining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and vivid imagery compensate for slight structural hollowness; succeeds as poetic meditation but feels slightly engineered to fit assigned elements rather than organically developed.</comment>
