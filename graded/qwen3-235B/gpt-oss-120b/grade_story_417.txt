<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks consistent internal logic; the zealot's sudden shift to vulnerability feels unearned. Dialogue is minimal, reducing distinct voice development. The theoretical rhetoric overshadows grounded motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually tight but structurally uneven; key transitions (vine seizing cap) occur abruptly. The "unspoken agreement" conceit drives events, but the narrative arc relies on thematic abstraction over cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (humidity, flickering chandeliers) but the Victorian parlor/jungle juxtaposition feels decorative rather than symbolically integrated. Sensory immersion is strong but thematically underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (jungle as contract, cap as altar) offer layered subtext. The ending's symbolic surrender achieves emotional resonance through understatement. Strength lies in conceptual ambiguity rather than direct exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes in concept but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("nervous fireflies"). The zealot archetype leans toward caricature, though the cap's physicality grounds it. Emotional nuance is undercut by thematic over-determination.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly; the parlor/vine juxtaposition and cap ritual create memorable tension. Some motifs (theoretical playfulness) feel disconnected from the storyâ€™s darker existential stakes.</grade>
