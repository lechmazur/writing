<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivations are clear but underdeveloped beyond thematic functions. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person implications through narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; solar flare incident resolves too neatly with the hidden notebook. Pacing unevenly balances exposition and revelation within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting uses specific details (artificial suns, fridge postcards) for atmosphere but underutilizes sensory depth. Tone and concept connect thematically but lack visceral immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Literary devices like debris-redemption parallels are clever, but emotional impact is muted by conceptual abstraction. Subtext is present but risks overshadowing character grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story avoids major clichés but occasionally slips into poetic vagueness that feels calculated. Metaphors are fresh but verge on overdetermined; emotional nuance exists but isn’t fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but some (postcards, coathanger) feel conceptually forced. Brief length amplifies thematic focus but compromises deeper narrative coherency.</comment>
