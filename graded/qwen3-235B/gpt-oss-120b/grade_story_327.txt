<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations feel abstract and underexplored despite poetic language. Restlessness manifests superficially through actions without connecting to relatable internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is mostly linear but strained by forced road closure device. The arc from index card to completed sigil is clear, but pacing feels compressed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid mineral-based worldbuilding undermined by undercooked metaphysical rules. Luminous pearls and stone lack functional connection to thematic elements like memory or legacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegant lyricism elevates the prose, particularly in metaphors connecting water/tide to creativity. Subtext about preserving knowledge through artistry resonates poetically but could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally overreaches with "complexly simple" abstractions. Some descriptors trend toward ornamental over precise, though individual voice emerges through rhythmic sentence structures.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration feels curatorial rather than organic. Creates atmospheric mood but lacks thematic urgency – like a beautiful diorama lacking narrative heartbeat.</comment>
