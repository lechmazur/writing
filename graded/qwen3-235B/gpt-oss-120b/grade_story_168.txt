<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's traits (ruthless, intellectually spontaneous) are present but underexplored; motivations tied to "watcher's burden" lack psychological depth; flower arranging isn't clearly connected to ruthless attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear decoding arc but feels compressed; cause-and-effect connections between past conversations and present actions are vague; climax lacks emotional payoff due to rushed pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Imagery is evocative but disjointed; stone circle's mystery isn't deepened by sensory details; "pause between verses" creates poetic atmosphere but doesn't integrate with setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (burden as weight, comb as key) are conceptually rich but abstract; themes of observation and liberation flicker without full realization; ending resolves plot but not character tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Phrases like "polite anarchy" surprise, but "ruthless" and "watcher's burden" feel vague rather than intentionally cryptic; emotional cues (burden's weight) are stated more than dramatized; some formulaic descriptions ("soft wind," "cracked voices").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly weighted; comb and rock art drive momentum, other elements (road trip, singer's pause) float disconnected; prose style is ambitious but lacks precision in key moments.</comment>
