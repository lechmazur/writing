<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's lineage and self-perceived inadequacy are clear but lack depth beyond surface traits; motivation to confront limitations feels abrupt, though the first-person voice (dry, self-deprecating) provides cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from packages to hologram to broadcast, though the station's sudden activation of star-forged heritage feels slightly rushed; the cyclical return to "bored excitement" in the ending provides structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned station's rust-caked decay and liminal farmland/corporate sprawl fusion create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere; sensory details (flickering consoles, violet runes) enhance mood but the connection between ancient magic and farming community remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "prison of self-doubt" resonate; the subversion of "exceptionally usual" tricks and corporate vs. heritage themes add depth; ending resolves conflict clearly, though the farmer's reaction to the spell broadcast feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Echoes of AI-generated phrasing (e.g., "dormant power stir") and generic descriptors ("ancient promises") undercut originality; the hybrid sci-fi/magic setting and emotionally nuanced tone-shifting avoid clich√©s, but some transitions (e.g., sudden archive activation) lean overly convenient.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a thematically unified narrative; the interplay of heritage, rebellion against mediocrity, and corporate encroachment achieves emotional resonance, with each choice (e.g., doll head's sentience) feeling purposeful despite the brief format.</comment>
