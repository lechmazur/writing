<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's ambivalence is thematically present but underdeveloped. Motivation ties to cosmic themes but feels vaguely defined. Emotional complexity is hinted at through symbolic actions rather than fully realized psychology. Archetypal gestures (whispering to dust) suggest inner conflict but lack visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a surreal ritual arc but struggles with internal logic. The marble-puzzle connection lacks mechanical clarity within the world's rules. The cosmic scoreboard's transformation is more symbolic than narratively coherent. The compressed format forces abrupt shifts between mystical and concrete actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Establishes atmospheric details (basalt walls, lunar wind) that evoke isolation. The mining colony's oppressive drills are effective but superficially treated. The interaction between setting elements (oath, marbles, lunar cycles) creates intriguing tensions but underutilizes environmental storytelling potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of paradoxical imagery (happy/sad, bashful arrogance) creates textured tone. Metaphors like "cosmic scoreboard" offer clever conceptual inversion. Occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction that prioritizes sound over meaning. Ending achieves haunting beauty through resonant chord and fading voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through synecdochic storytelling. Combines spiritual and mechanical elements in unconventional ways (worship in mining colony, oath as cosmic code). Some descriptors ("nebula forming in mind") risk abstraction. Sensory details show authorial control but occasional vagueness about tactile reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements form coherent cosmic parable but sacrifice emotional immediacy for philosophical scope. The lunar setting effectively supports thematic concerns. The story feels purposeful within constraints though resolution remains abstract. Balance between symbolic weight and narrative urgency could be tighter.</comment>
