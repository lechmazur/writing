<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character shows clear motivation and reaction to the tile/memory, but remains abstract with limited emotional depth despite introspective themes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Packs coherence into tight word limit with cause-effect logic, but relies on abrupt transitions between mall/simulation and lacks narrative urgency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion across elements with lingering resonance, but uneven pacing and underexplored emotional subtext limit broader impact.</comment>
