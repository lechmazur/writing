<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is present but underexplored; Aric’s cynical hopefulness informs his actions, but his motivations and reactions lack psychological depth, relying on poetic abstraction rather than grounded emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but uneven; cause-and-effect (herbs → beacon activation) is logical, but the speed-dating setup feels narratively disjointed, and the tight word limit strains the arc’s resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: the juxtaposition of decaying medieval grandeur and synthetic relics creates vivid tension; sensory details (smoke, light, ash) immerse, though some setting elements strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (horizon of mercy, orchard’s demise) and subtext; the ending resonates thematically, though some emotional beats (Liora’s connection) lean on implication rather than fully realized impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality is present but uneven; combining a drone pilot with medieval tropes subverts expectations, but phrases like “charred serenity” and the speed-dating event border on contrivance, risking artificial whimsy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements effectively overall, but the speed-dating framework and “charred serenity” tone occasionally distract from deeper thematic momentum, making cohesion feel strained.</comment>
