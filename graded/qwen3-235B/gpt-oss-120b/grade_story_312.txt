<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but insufficiently layered, with internal conflict resolving too neatly. The agoraphobia and ancestral burden themes emerge through action but lack the psychological complexity needed for a transformation of this magnitude.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structures a satisfying arc but strains credibility through convenience—rhythm of rain guiding a hidden switch feels arbitrary. The connection between inherited burdens and the physical/metaphorical "cracking" is clever but rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive with strong sensory details (whispering dunes, luminous dust), but atmospheric elements occasionally overwhelm narrative function—whispering dunes as a recurring motif could be more tightly integrated with plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Employes metaphor (walls as mirrors) and motif (rain's rhythm) effectively. The theme of inherited fear shaping identity is poignant, though the philosophical resolution lacks the nuanced ambiguity that could elevate it beyond inspirational cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts agoraphobia as a metaphor for generational trauma with fresh imagery. Avoids pure cliché through interplay of "realistically fanciful" dust and desert symbolism, though some phrasing (e.g., "living tapestry") veers toward stock poetics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric unity but uneven emotional payoff. The brevity works for thematic impact, though key transitions (city isolation → desert journey) could feel more earned while better utilizing inherited burden implications.</comment>
