<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and consistent actions aligned with curiosity, but lacks psychological depth; motivation to 'unmask broken precedents' remains abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as a fragmented sequence of symbolic actions without clear tension; transformation feels abrupt despite logical progression of steps. Labyrinth path provides structural skeleton but lacks narrative propulsion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gilded gearwork aesthetics and amber light create immersive atmosphere; however, sensory details remain decorative rather than organically integrated with character psychology or symbolic action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors about rewriting creative paradigms resonate thematically; ending achieves symbolic closure through crystal engine activation. Subtext about archivists as inheritors of forgotten knowledge gives depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Recalls steampunk archetypes but subverts through surreal descriptions like 'living light' from blueprint ink. Avoids generic phrasing more often than not, though some phrases ('dying coals') verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Elements forced into poetic alignment rather than organic necessity; story exists primarily as elaborate metaphor without sufficient emotional anchoring or structural cohesion to justify brevity.</grade>
