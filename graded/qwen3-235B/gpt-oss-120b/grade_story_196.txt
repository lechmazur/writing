<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's apathy and past defiance are established but lack psychological complexity; inner conflict resolved too neatly, reducing emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; meteor shower climax feels rushed, but the mirror between beginning's inertness and ending's action provides minimal coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Monastery's atmosphere is vivid but underutilizes floating rock mechanics; sensory details like "clanking armor" and "tarnished amulet" create strong but superficially sustained mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "meteors as breadcrumbs") elevates impact, but thematic exploration of self-determination lacks subtext or originality despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessive adjectives/adverbs ("fiercely apathetic," "knowing naivety") border on purple prose; metaphors like the "seed-shaped promise" feel predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Story coheres due to tight thematic repetition but sacrifices realism; forced element integration (e.g., resigned colleague) weakens emotional authenticity.</comment>
