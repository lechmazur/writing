<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's traits are stylistically present but lack behavioral nuance; motivation aligns with assigned element but inner conflict remains under-explained. The poet's rebellious formalism influences only surface-level imagery, not structural choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Action sequence (solving riddle, activating sundial) drives plot but resolution feels abrupt; timeframe compression obscures temporal logic despite strong cyclical closure. Pacing prioritizes poetic beats over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is gorgeously textured with sensory paradoxs (whispering ivy, pulsing wax) but setting's symbolic role (transition/memorial) overtly dictates theme without earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Linguistic precision creates vivid imagery and metaphor (e.g., "rebellious chord") but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral; theme of restored memory emerges clearly but lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in combining metaphysical puzzle-solving with literary restoration; risks purple prose in over-kinetic descriptions. Subtextual handling of collective memory is fresh, but character psychology occasionally flattens into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive framing of assigned elements sacrifices narrative fluidity in pivotal moments (e.g., sudden passenger manifestation). The metaphor of "undoing" resonates thematically but strains plausibility of emotional payoff.</comment>
