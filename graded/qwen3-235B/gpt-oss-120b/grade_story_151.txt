<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's awe and rationality lack integration; motivation to topple the idol feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded, with actions driven more by thematic concepts than personal history or nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent plot arc but strained by abstract cause-effect logic (e.g., snowflake patterns undermining an idol); pacing uneven due to compressed explanations that occasionally stall momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually rich yet inconsistently textured setting; sensory details evoke isolation but falter in anchoring symbolic elements (e.g., "shifting ice floes") to visceral experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and resonant themes (hope vs. fear) elevate impact, but emotional engagement is dulled by over-reliance on poetic abstraction over lived-in character responses.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh symbolism (wedding veil as analytical tool), but occasionally drifts into ornate, AI-default phrasing ("crystal shadows seep into soil like liquid moon") that dilutes authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around themes but strain under conceptual weight; brevity works for poetic effect but undermines deeper exploration of ideas like "the last human emotion."</comment>
