<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's sassy voice and culinary rebellion are distinct, but motivation remains surface-level rebellion without deeper exploration. Actions align with traits, but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fracturing reality through camera flashes and vault breaches drives the plot, but some transitions between action beats lack fluidity. The circular structure (chaos introduced/chaos escaped) works, though resolution feels abrupt within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking contrast between sterile quantum technology and visceral culinary elements. Sensory details (ozone, spices) immerse readers, but the reality calibration office's function remains underdeveloped beyond its aesthetic contrast to the character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("equations bent like dough") elevate the prose. The rebellion-as-seasoning theme is clever and consistent. Ending lingers conceptually, though emotional resonance could deepen through subtext rather than symbolic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original combination of bureaucratic tech with culinary surrealism avoids tropes. Language remains purposeful despite occasional florid flourishes. Nuanced emotional beats (e.g., key's "weight like a promise") show human-like subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements integrate cohesively, with the culinary rebellion trope enhancing rather than constraining the theme. Stylistic choices (e.g., fragmented sentences during chaos) serve tone without muddying clarity. The tight word count emphasizes brevity as strength.</comment>
