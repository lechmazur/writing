<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (desire for authenticity) are clear but surface-level; the "nervous" trait manifests physically but lacks psychological depth. The "rarely sincere" attribute shapes his art but isn't meaningfully challenged or resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent escape arc with tight time constraint, but the progression through tunnels feels mechanically schematic. The bacteria-luminescence method lacks concrete obstacles, making tension depend too heavily on atmospheric elements rather than actionable stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Biological-mechanical fusion in setting is vividly rendered through sensory overload—fermented air, pulsing microbes, neon haze. The bacteria-powered city's living mechanics directly enable the navigation method, though the bioluminescent constellations at the end border on visual overload rather than organic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong subtext of artistry vs. authenticity emerges through the lute/music metaphors mirroring bacterial light. The final "true note" creates poignant resonance between protagonist and cosmos. Some lyrical abstraction tips into ambiguity, but the star-path motif provides structural cohesion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original core concepts undermined by inconsistent execution. The bacteria city concept is genuinely fresh, but the "cautious revelry" tone remains mostly stated rather than demonstrated. Occasional mechanical language ("pulsing like veins") feels formulaic; the candle-as-timer device works but lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric tone poem but struggles as narrative—many elements (photo, constellations, candle) create cohesion through poetic association rather than organic storytelling. Technical elements showcase imagination, but emotional authenticity remains elusive, making market viability moderate.</comment>
