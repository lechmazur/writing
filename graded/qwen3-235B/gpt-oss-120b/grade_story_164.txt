<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Corin’s wistfulness and reverence for nature are evident but insufficiently grounded in concrete behavior; his “drifting arrogance” feels imposed rather than earned through organic interaction with his sketches or setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to the brief’s constraints but lacks significant stakes or transformation; the inciting action (projecting sketches) and resolution (subtle rebellion) are conceptually aligned but emotionally inert due to truncation of cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic fusion of cyberpunk grime and organic yearning is masterful—neon’s flicker as “leaf-like patterns,” data-rain-soaked coats, and dust motes as cartographic waypoints create an immersive, paradoxical landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors are consistently startling (“veins spreading across steel walls”) and the ending’s quiet hope resonates beyond the narrative; subtext about resistance through art is layered but occasionally undercut by overly abstract execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction (“cartographic hymn”) that risks obscurity; emotional resonance is implied through imagery rather than visceral character engagement, leaning on poetic over human truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>The story’s cohesion hinges on metaphoric boldness, but its ambition occasionally outpaces the word limit’s demands; the central metaphor is potent, though character and plot remain sketches rather than fully incised etchings.</comment>
