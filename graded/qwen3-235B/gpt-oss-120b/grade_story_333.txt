<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; motivations (preserving traditions through fear confrontation) are clear but psychological depth is sacrificed for poetic abstraction</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cyclical structure works within word limits but key plot turns rely on atmospheric shifts rather than narrative logic; progression feels more conjured than earned</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive: ozone-taste, breathing walls, storm-rhythm pacing create oppressive atmosphere; every sensory detail serves mood and thematic coherence</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose creates lingering resonance (e.g., "braided bitterness"), but emotional payoff remains conceptual rather than viscerally human; lacks narrative teeth beneath lyrical sheen</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original imagery (shifting floor as "living memory") contrasts with clich√©d elements ("whispered of forgotten rites"); "braided bitterness" concept feels more decorative than thematically essential</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements interweave thematically but lack narrative necessity; story retains elegance-as-concept but risks becoming a self-contained symbol mosaic rather than lived experience</comment>
