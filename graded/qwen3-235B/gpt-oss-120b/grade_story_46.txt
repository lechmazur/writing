<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits shape his actions but remain surface-level; motivation is present but lacks depth in connecting to emotional or psychological nuance, leaving the performer more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels compressed; the moon-alignment climax drives plot but lacks layered progression from beginning to end due to limited causal buildup within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally teeters on edge of ornateness; avoids formulaic structure, though some atmospheric descriptions border on excessive lyricism rather than purposeful metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>All elements are utilized, but cohesion relies heavily on the setting's dream logic rather than narrative momentum; the ending resolves the immediate arc but leaves the broader world feeling insular.</comment>
