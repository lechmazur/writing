<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Corin’s spinelessness contrasts intriguingly with his decisive actions, but motivations remain underexplored; emotional depth feels abbreviated, relying more on poetic suggestion than character behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—descriptive pauses enrich atmosphere but slow tension; the prophecy’s resolution feels abrupt, though the circular structure (key’s symbolic weight at story’s start/end) provides cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (oil, vellum, humming lanterns) and metaphysical atmosphere merge beautifully; however, the “hush after the wind” timeframe isn’t deeply integrated beyond static mood-setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luminous doubt as a motif is viscerally rendered through the setting; subtext of rewriting destiny via mentorship elevates the narrative. Prose occasionally becomes ornamental, diluting emotional precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Avoids genre clichés with “spineless mercenary-mentor” paradox; metaphors (e.g., constellations as scrambled letters) are inventive. Some descriptors (e.g., “bright uncertainty”) verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Ambition exceeds execution: thematic richness is evident, but brevity underdevelops stakes and character nuance. The ending’s metaphorical resonance lingers, suggesting latent potential not fully actualized.</comment>
