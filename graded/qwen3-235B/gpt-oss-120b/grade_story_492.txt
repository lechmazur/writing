<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation is clear yet feels abstractly stated rather than organically demonstrated through nuanced action or emotional conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a complete arc but pacing feels rushed in key transitions (e.g., infiltration mechanics glossed over); cause/effect is logical but lacks depth in connecting setup to climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through neon/graffiti imagery and mechanical decay, but world-building elements like the syndicate's role remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and sensory details elevate the prose, but emotional impact is undercut by surface-level treatment of themes like hope and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Trope-heavy cyberpunk imagery ("fractured data shards") and overly ornate phrasing suggest formulaic tendencies; some metaphors (e.g., "neon scars") show creativity without subverting genre norms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements are competently integrated but lack transformative synergy; the ending's redemptive tone resonates visually but doesn't deepen narrative themes beyond surface plot.</comment>
