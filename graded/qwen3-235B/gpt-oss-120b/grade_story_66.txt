<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are poetically hinted at but lack concrete exploration; reactions to objects feel symbolic but not deeply personal, leaving emotional resonance underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves from quiet rebellion to transformation but pacing falters in the middle; connections between beginning and end are thematic rather than structural, weakening arc clarity despite poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly textured but unevenâ€”sensory details often overwhelm practical setting logic, and timeframe's "jigsaw puzzles spanning the semester" lacks temporal grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and lyrical imagery elevate the narrative; subtext about belonging resonates, but emotional beats are occasionally stated rather than embodied, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional overwritten prose ("carbonized into something more alive") and predictable motifs like mirrors/silence; avoids major tropes but flirts with abstraction-heavy AI hallmarks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of assigned elements, but urgency and cohesion suffer under the weight of symbolism; ends with philosophical weight but feels deliberately vague rather than purposefully ambiguous.</comment>
