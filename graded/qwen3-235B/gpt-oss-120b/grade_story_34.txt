<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (morose, objectively emotional) lack nuanced exploration beyond description; motivations tied to 'resurrecting home' remain abstract without emotional depth or concrete transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively but leans on abstract symbolism over concrete cause/effect; ending resolves conceptually but feels emotionally unresolved due to thin narrative throughline in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting details (interdimensional lounge, ozone/coffee scent) and mysterious tone create vivid, layered atmosphere that deeply reinforces themes and emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (amber ribbons as memories, anvil as compromise) and resonant ending elevate impact; some emotional beats are stated rather than shown through character actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imaginative core concepts but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("vaulted ceilings stitched with constellations") and predictable emotional signposts; balance between originality and restraint is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements thematically but prioritizes atmospheric density over narrative clarity; leaves lingering questions about 'home' as metaphor, though some connections feel forced rather than organic.</comment>
