<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear traits and consistent motivation, but lacks depth in showing internal conflict or growth beyond a surface-level revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</comment>Well-paced with logical cause-effect, though the resolution feels abrupt. Narrative arc is complete but slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "walls warned of missteps," "wind chimes") immerse readers, though the setting leans more on atmosphere than functional integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolic use of the opener/chimes, but the theme of "listening" lacks layered subtext. Relies on telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Evocative language avoids clichés but occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing. The twist on "map" feels original, but the workshop trope and resolution lack freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven, but some (puppet master, timeframe) feel decorative. The story’s metaphorical payoff is strong but unevenly executed.</comment>
