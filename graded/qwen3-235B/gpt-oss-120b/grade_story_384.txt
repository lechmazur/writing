<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Lacks plausible motivation for a cook in a scientific facility; actions don't logically align with role; character's shift from frantic to calm feels unearned; occupation isn't organically tied to conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on implausible actions (erasing seismic data); cause-effect relationships between notches and revelations lack technical plausibility; condensed arc suffers from compressed pacing; concept drives structure at the expense of logical progression</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decaying scientific hubris rendered through tactile sensory details; dust/eraser/wooden stick create tactile continuity; setting's oppressive temporality effectively mirrors thematic concerns about predictive fallacy</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (seismic data as carved wood) provoke philosophical questions about prediction; final revelation lacks emotional weight due to underdeveloped conflict; poetic language occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity; tone sustains thematic resonance</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avant-garde premise undercut by stock phrases ("centuries of layered dust"); unique concept buried under excessive lyricism; character psychology feels algorithmically inferred rather than authentically rendered; linguistic complexity often serves evasion rather than illumination</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story possesses intellectual ambition but structural awkwardness; thematic coherence undercut by mechanical integration of assigned elements; evocative moments drowned in ornamental prose; ambitious ideas marred by inconsistent execution</comment>
