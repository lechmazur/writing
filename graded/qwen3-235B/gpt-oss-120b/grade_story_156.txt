<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's confusion is thematic but lacks emotional depth; motivations shift between liberalizing trade and evolutionary curiosity without full psychological realism; actions occasionally feel abstract rather than grounded in specific human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc involving revelation about unity, but pivotal moments (key use, unlocking chamber) feel compressed; pacing balances reflection and progression yet sacrifices causal clarity during critical transitions like the decision to follow bird patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in eerie subterranean setting; consistent use of salt imagery enhances themes but occasionally verges on overwrought symbolism; atmospheric details (singing walls, salt-dust stars) create memorable mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphors (birds as societal adaptation, key as bridge between worlds) elevates the theme of interconnectedness; resolution feels satisfyingly poetic but risks vagueness; the central conflict between cultural preservation and external influence remains under-clarified.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids cloying tropes in most imagery (singing walls, starling diagrams) but occasionally lapses into overdetermined phrases like "joyously tragic"; emotional resonance leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than specific character experiences; stylistic ambition outpaces psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified vision despite word constraints; the salt-mine setting and birds' flight work synergistically but other elements (bus rides, evolutionary wisdom) feel appended; central message about cross-cultural connection lingers but execution strains against length limitations.</comment>
