<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is present but overly abstract; motivations are clear yet lack concrete grounding in recognizable human nuance, with emotional responses conveyed more through poetic abstraction than lived-in experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression through symbolic actions, but the condensed structure occasionally leads to abrupt transitions between pivotal moments, risking emotional resonance in the climactic choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stunning fusion of storm-eroded architecture and metaphysics creates visceral immersion; the lighthouse's trapped-in-time atmosphere permeates every sensory detail, from salt-corroded metal to the glass's infinite tides.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and layered symbolism (compass as fractured purpose, wilted rose as lost beauty) create lingering thematic questions about free will versus determinism, though some imagery verges on self-indulgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Uneven balance between arresting originality ("joyful agony" works) and formulaic phrasing ("tears taste like salt and honey"). Certain symbols (mirror as reality's fractal) feel derivative despite fresh contextual framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through obsessive thematic repetition but occasionally sacrifices narrative clarity; the ending resolves the central dilemma while leaving the symbolic system's internal logic partially undefined.</comment>
