<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's vigilance and grief are present but thinly sketched; motivations feel symbolic rather than deeply felt, with underexplored ties to his sister's death.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is logically structured but strained by the word limit; revelations feel compressed, undermining emotional weight of the conspiracy's unmasking.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Uneven sensory detail: ripe apples contrast with sterile planes, but the paper facility and orchard connections are underdeveloped, weakening immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clever use of peacock symbolism subverts tropes, but the syndicate's existence and paper-plane code feel contrived, echoing algorithmic plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesive on paper, but the brevity forces shallow execution; elements like the orchardist's profession and the syndicate feel grafted rather than organic.</comment>
