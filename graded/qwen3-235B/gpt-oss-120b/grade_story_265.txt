<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character portrayed as emotionally distant but lacks depth in motivations; the "personally impersonal" trait feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot lacks narrative propulsion beyond atmospheric meandering; the oil change ritual serves as weak scaffolding for mystical imagery that doesn't fully resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, original setting merges cathedral solemnity with orchard's sensuous vitality; sensory details create immersive, sacredly eerie atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and metaphorical language evoke meditation on grace and perception; ending's thematic resonance outweighs underdeveloped narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original combinations (bees as translators, twist ties as metaphors) avoid clich√©s; language occasionally risks becoming self-consciously poetic but generally maintains purposeful density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in practice; the cathedral's hybridization with orchard and bees' metaphysical role feel both visionary and structurally unbalanced.</comment>
