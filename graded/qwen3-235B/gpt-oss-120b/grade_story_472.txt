<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are poetic but thinly realized; Lira’s motivation as a matchmaker is conceptually tied to the action but lacks psychological depth or relatable nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but uneven; the button’s revelation feels abrupt. The interstellar secret’s thematic resolution works despite the constrained pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive imagery creates atmosphere; however, the zeppelin’s mechanics and timeframe (“between channels”) lack logical integration with narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Packs emotional resonance through metaphorical storytelling; the interplay of imagery and theme (“untold stories binding hearts”) elevates the craft to near-transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sufficiently inventive to avoid cliché, though phrases like “complicatedly simple” verge on forced cleverness. Emotional showing dominates, but some descriptions border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements blend into a compelling concept, but tighter cohesion between the character’s internal logic and external world building would elevate it further.</comment>
