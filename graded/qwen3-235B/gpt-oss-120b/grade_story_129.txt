<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Archetypal troubadour lacks psychological complexity; motivation is conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped. Actions align with curse-breaking theme but feel performative rather than psychologically grounded. Minimal distinct voice in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Launch pad transformation provides structural scaffolding, but pacing suffers from poetic compression. Logical gaps between tablecloth incantations and rocket ignition. Plot coherence maintained through metaphor rather than causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid decay imagery creates haunting atmosphere; rust/space interface intriguingly juxtaposes industrial past with emotional future. Underutilized sensory potential—temperature, tactile details missing from tactile curse-breaking ritual.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Extended metaphor operates on multiple symbolic levels; "torpedoed grief" as existential payload shows linguistic daring. Lacks emotional payoff beneath surface lyricism; themes resonate intellectually rather than viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("steady yet unpredictable" repetitions) risks poetic monotony. Sensory details specific but unevenly distributed; psychological nuance missing in protagonist's transformation. Avoids major clichés through original metaphoric combinations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce through thematic intentionality rather than narrative necessity; launches feel slightly contrived rather than organically integrated. Stylistic ambition compensates technical shortcomings but lacks emotional authenticity required for top-tier acclaim.</comment>
