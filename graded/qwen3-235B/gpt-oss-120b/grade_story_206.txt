<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (reclaiming locket for hidden continent) lacks psychological depth; vendetta's emotional core feels underexplored. Internal conflict between vengeance and redemption isn't sufficiently dramatized. First-person voice prioritizes poetic resonance over distinct character voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Possible throughline of revenge-to-revelation arc exists, but condensed structure leaves key turns underdeveloped (e.g., locket's discovery mechanism). Causal chain relies on narrative sleight-of-hand rather than earned progression. Ending's thematic reversal feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion (cinnamon dust, peppermint shards) masterfully builds haunting market atmosphere. However, "forgotten" elements recur as vague thematic crutches rather than organically shaping character or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich language ("sugary fury," "caramel ribbons") creates haunting imagery and subtext about sweetness-as-resistance. Thematic fusion of bitterness/redemption could achieve greater nuance, but emotional impact resides in symbolic execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging culinary art with rebellion iconography. Some descriptors ("amber dunes," "emerald seas") verge on stock imagery. The cyclical logic of revenge becoming hope strains credibility but avoids pure clich√© through surreal presentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements create compelling tension between sweetness and resistance, though thematic heavy lifting occasionally overwhelms narrative. The ending's ideological pivot feels simultaneously ambitious and undercooked, leaving meaningful questions about memory and revolution.</comment>
