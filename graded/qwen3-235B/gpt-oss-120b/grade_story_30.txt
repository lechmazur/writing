<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations connect to traditions but lack psychological nuance; reliance on symbolic gestures (tree planting) overshadows interiority, while telekinetic powers serve plot mechanics more than personal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc follows a coherent problem-solution pattern (translation → navigation), but compressed pacing leaves pivotal transitions (e.g., AI sapling manifestation) feeling underexplored despite strong conceptual linkage between elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually rich fusion of decaying medievalism and derelict spacefaring technology creates haunting atmosphere; however, sensory immersion often prioritizes poetic flourish over functional worldbuilding (e.g., hydro garden mechanics remain vague).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical layers (dice as fate, trees as memory) elevate thematic resonance; holographic sapling as living database combines poetic and narrative functions effectively, though emotional beats occasionally lean on excessive metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally falters under its own lyricism ("sacred disorder," "chaotic hymn"); the fusion of agrarian mysticism and space piracy offers fresh conceptual territory despite minor overindulgence in thematic repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Element integration is generally cohesive with minor friction—tapestry's linguistic mysteries and family rituals work best, while some mechanical plot points (AI sapling translation) strain internal logic. Ending offers conceptual closure without emotional saturation.</comment>
