<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is consistent in stoicism but lacks emotional depth; motivation to "defy conformity" is shown through actions rather than deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise drives itself efficiently but relies on sudden, under-explained mechanics (e.g., decoded labels = hidden compartments); coherent arc within constraints but feels compressed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory texture (glass dome, rust, flickering flame) and miniature scale amplify themes; museum functions as a living metaphor for curated perfection vs. hidden flaws.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery ("hollow defiance," "cynical warmth") and nested symbolism elevate the narrative; ending leans on thematic repetition rather than earning its catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subverts "sentient curators" trope with quiet rebellion; occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction ("secret promise" of a cameo) but never devolves into clich√© or artificial complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively to interrogate artifice vs. authenticity; constrained structure feels intentional, though the orchard-museum link and coded labels border on cryptic convenience.</comment>
