<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character background feels arbitrarily imposed; the conscientious objector aspect doesn't organically influence Milo's motivations or actions, and interactions with secondary characters lack emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</question><comment>Assigned elements inconsistently support narrative cohesion; the story struggles to unify its multiple required components into a seamless whole without contrivances.</comment>
