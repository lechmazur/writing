<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character remains a static archetype; motivation is stated but not earned through internal or external conflict. Actions lack visceral emotional context, making the transformation unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels compressed; critical steps (e.g., capsule opening) occur without clear cause-effect progression. Resolution satisfies surface-level arc but lacks narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a haunting atmosphere, but setting's fantastical elements (variable star, nebulae) remain superficial backdrops rather than integral to character motivation or plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose showcases technical skill with metaphors and symbolic fusion of material/spiritual. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional engagement is diluted by abstract, often cryptic phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies excessively on vague, poetic abstraction and conceptual vagueness. Predictable revolutionary narrative and overwritten metaphors undermine originality despite occasional fresh imagery (dissolving nail as narrative engine).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Attempts to fuse mystical and tangible elements cohesively but prioritizes style over substance. Memorable stylistically but lacks emotional or intellectual urgency to justify its ambition.</comment>
