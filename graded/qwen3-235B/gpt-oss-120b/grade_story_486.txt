<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s clumsily dexterous attribute influences her actions, yet motivation lacks depth; her internal conflict between technical skill and silent rebellion feels minimally explored despite coherent external behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with pantomime driving the action, but pacing feels compressed; the connection between Mara’s performances and the crowd’s transformation leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than fully realized cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (e.g., glowing glass, humming cauldron) create a vivid, mystical atmosphere that complements the theme of silent subversion; timeframe reference is underdeveloped but not distracting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (silence as retribution, pantomime as critique) and layered symbolism elevate the narrative; the closing image of the softened city lingers, achieving emotional resonance without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original conceits (sound engineer, practical illusion) subvert genre expectations; prose avoids most clichés but occasionally verges on ornate description without corresponding thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Elements cohere overall, though the witch’s role and timeframe feel perfunctory; brevity is leveraged effectively but leaves some thematic implications underexplored.</comment>
