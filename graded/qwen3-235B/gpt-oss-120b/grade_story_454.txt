<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Predictable motivation; character's duality as "rationally emotional" remains underdeveloped, reducing complexity to surface contradictions. Actions align with plot demands but lack psychological nuance, failing to transcend genre archetypes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative structure exists cosmetically, but pacing stumbles between atmospheric descriptions and abrupt resolution. The map's torn edge and alarms feel contrived, with cause-effect blurred by excessive ornamental language.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting achieves vivid atmosphere through sensory details (neon, mirror fragments), but the funhouse-and-midnight framework relies on Gothic clich√©s. The juxtaposition of jubilant despair succeeds, though deeper integration of "map's torn edge" is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is implied rather than earned; metaphors like the clover's glow lean on overtested symbols. The central conflict (proving loyalty) resolves too neatly. Subtext about inherited trauma through the witch mother feels hastily appended.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Phrases like "jubilant despair" and "phantom judges" risk artificial profundity. Sensory details lack specificity beneath their lushness, and Mara's recognition of the "same rhythm" feels narratively convenient rather than earned psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Premise strains coherence under its own ornate construction. Assigned elements awkwardly coexist rather than interweave; themes of trust and duality emerge but insufficiently justify the contrived plot mechanics and setting.</comment>
