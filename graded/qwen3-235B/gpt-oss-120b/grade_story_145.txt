<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psychological complexity undermines the protagonist's inner conflict, though the 'uncertainly certain' resolve creates intriguing tension between rebellion and purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Echo test mechanics drive action but sacrifice pacing—some cause-effect transitions feel compressed despite a coherent mythopoeic arc from exile to transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vividly rendered atmosphere merges gothic decay with metaphorical resonance; however, the library's symbolic connection to 'hidden worlds' lacks sufficient mythological scaffolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical tapestry (whispering books, empathic water) elevates craft, but emotional beats often state rather than demonstrate internal transformation through sensory experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Excessive ornate abstractions ('colliding destinies', 'papery petals') border on mannerism; empathic conclusion feels conceptually novel despite trope-laden framework of fallen orders and magical tests.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively but unevenly—the echo-test's specificity feels artificially imposed rather than organically connected to the castle's existing architecture.</comment>
