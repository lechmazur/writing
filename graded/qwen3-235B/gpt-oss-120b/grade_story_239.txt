<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice and motivation remains abstract. Reactions to objects reveal little about internal states; motivations hinted at but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing manages tension well within constraints, but resolution feels abrupt. Cause-effect relationships hold logically, though the plot relies on atmospheric momentum rather than narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like pine/dust and luminous shards create an immersive, ethereal mood. The setting enhances the mysticism but occasionally verges on self-indulgent description without functional narrative integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the craft, but emotional resonance feels curated rather than earned. The theme of fragmented connection is clear, though under-explained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in concept exists, but lush descriptions occasionally tip into purple prose. Nuanced emotion is shown, though certain phrases ("secret defiance," "timeless resolve") lean toward abstraction over substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion despite multiple elements, many serve as symbolic scaffolding rather than narrative drivers. Style occasionally obscures clarity but leaves a lingering symbolic impression.</comment>
