<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character exhibits a distinct voice and symbolic evolution, but motivations are hinted rather than deeply explored; internal conflict implied through objects but lacks visceral emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical progression with meaningful beats, but the tight word limit strains the arc's resolution; thematic cohesion outweighs structural precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Evocative, contradictory textures (desert chaos vs. lava lamp quiet) immerse effectively, though some details risk atmospheric schtick (lava lamp verges on kitsch).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and thematic resonance with "quiet rebellion" elevate the story, though occasional overreliance on poetic abstraction dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with the "garden of intent" metaphor, but some phrases ("steadily chaotic," "wandering heart") border on algorithmic lyricism rather than earned originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a meditative whole despite tonal clashes; limited by its brevity but succeeds as a symbolic sketch rather than a limitation.</comment>
