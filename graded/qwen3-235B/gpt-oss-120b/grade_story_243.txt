<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority; motivations are plot-driven, not psychologically grounded. The "jumpy necromancer" trait is superficial, never interrogating how trauma/code corruption might manifest in actions beyond twitchy movement. Actions don't reveal deeper vulnerability or obsession that would make the character compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mechanical plot progression through symbol hunting feels procedurally game-like rather than narratively organic. The fishhook as plot device strains credulity in its transition from narrative clue to literal key. Pacing mismanages tension—icon unmasking happens abruptly without emotional payoff, undermining the final scene's gravitas.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brilliant sensory specificity in pixel aesthetics (flickering halos, static moon bar) creates immersive cognitive dissonance between nostalgic game tropes and subversive truth. The protest mural's "code fragment" drips as data-dystopia metaphor exemplifies how setting actively produces meaning rather than merely containing it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Viscerally haunting imagery ("corrupted pixels" as false saints) delivers philosophical resonance about mythmaking in digital spaces. Subtext on collective heroism vs institutional control is potent, but the ending’s thematic epiphany lands too neatly, lacking the nuanced ambiguity such a complex theme deserves.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original blending of necromancy and digital decay avoids genre clichés while maintaining linguistic rigor—no "shimmering" or "haunting" beyond technical specificity. The revelation’s emotional weight relies on conceptual brilliance rather than over-explaining, though occasional adverb clusters ("twitch with nervous energy") undermine stylistic control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through tightly woven themes of corruption/deception, but emotional impact is diluted by procedural plot mechanics. The brevity serves the mythic tone effectively, though character connection remains elusive. Lingering power comes from its critique of digital hero-worship rather than individual characters.</comment>
