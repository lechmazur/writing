<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation is abstract and underdeveloped. The 'feral' quality is superficial, serving primarily as poetic ornamentation rather than shaping tangible behavior or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks narrative propulsion; repetitive circularity between abstract actions and poetic imagery creates stasis. Thematic concept substitutes for meaningful dramatic structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through surreal sensory details that create haunting emotional resonance, though occasionally verges on sensory overload without sufficient counterbalance from narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates exquisite linguistic craftsmanship with metaphors that surprise and resonate. The meta-textual theme of preserving ephemeral beauty becomes deeply moving through lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic writing but occasionally slips into baroque overproduction; some phrases ("whispered into the night," "legacy carried by sky") border on poetic clich√© despite overall originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherence exists through thematic unity rather than narrative mechanics. Ambitious in concept, though brevity prevents full realization of its own high ambitions as art object and narrative.</comment>
