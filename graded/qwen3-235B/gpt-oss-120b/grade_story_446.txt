<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Promising thematic motivation, but connections between obsession, gambling identity, and kingdom restoration lack psychological depth. Conversations with merchant feel underdeveloped, weakening character impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherent progression but final revelation feels abrupt. The firefly/castle manifestation lacks narrative scaffolding despite poetic resonance. Charity drive timeline compression sacrifices some tension control.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Evocative elements exist (fireflies, moonflowers) but world logic strains – how does ledger connect physically to celestial castle manifestation? Atmospheric cohesion present but ecological plausibility gaps exist.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric interplay between hydrolysis imagery and political transformation elevates. Final image achieves thematic resonance. Some emotional beats remain conceptual rather than visceral despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasionally diffuse diction ("quiet rebellion"). Metaphors fresh but occasional near-mystification of meaning. Avoids overt tropes but sacrifices precise emotional clarity at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Functional cohesion achieved but element weighting uneven – fireflies feel more decorative than organic. Strong final image provides closure, though structural compression costs some narrative depth.</comment>
