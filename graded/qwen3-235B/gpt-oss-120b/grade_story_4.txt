<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's playful trait is mentioned but insufficiently integrated into actions; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth; actions align with goals but reveal little complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-part structure exists but feels compressed; the thread’s role links plot points logically, though the ending’s resolution lacks emotional payoff in the constrained space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by sporadic ornate phrasing (“whispered to ancient gods”); metaphor density occasionally sacrifices clarity, but avoids major clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements synergize cohesively within the word limit; brevity amplifies poetic focus, though structural experimentation occasionally sacrifices narrative momentum.</comment>
