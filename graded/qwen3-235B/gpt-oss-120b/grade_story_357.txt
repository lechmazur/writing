<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s solitude-as-weapon motivation is consistent and drives actions, but psychological depth remains surface-level; emotional resonance lacks visceral specificity despite strong symbolic use of the rose and ice motifs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but pacing feels compressed; game mechanics-as-plot device work conceptually yet resolution seems abrupt, undermining the gradual unraveling of Despair’s narrative as described in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with tactile details (echoing icicles, melting ice) and metaphorical resonance between the black rose and frost setting. Weaknesses include reliance on overfamiliar “lair” tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric layering of solitude as both emotional armor and tactical advantage; prose balances poetic elegance with thematic clarity. Ending transcends mere victory to examine deliberate curation of experience. Somewhat undercut by slight sentimentality in final toast.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids generic fantasy pitfalls through personification of Despair and inversion of party-as-battlefield setup. Some overwritten passages (“cavern erupts in a soft aurora”) flirt with purple prose; emotional stakes stay poetic rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>High concept execution successfully weaves assigned elements into cohesive narrative. Strong thematic resonance between isolation and strategy. Minor inconsistency in pacing and character interiority prevent higher mark.</comment>
