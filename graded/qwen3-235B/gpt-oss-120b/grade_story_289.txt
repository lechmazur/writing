<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond assigned attributes; motivation is clear but underdeveloped, with minimal emotional or psychological nuance. The 'voice' through poetic narration feels more abstract than rooted in human-like interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through ritualistic repetition with a slight arc from discovery to revelation, but the constrained word limit leaves structural gaps in tension/resolution. Pacing drags slightly without a clear conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Richly evocative setting with strong sensory details (glowing bay, shimmering coat), but the connection to the futuristic timeframe feels superficial. Atmosphere supports theme but setting intricacies are underutilized narratively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Uses metaphorical imagery effectively (frailty as strength, ephemeral art as memory), though occasionally leans on poetic abstraction over concrete subtext. Emotional resonance feels controlled but lacks rawness; ending resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by blending sci-fi with unconventional archaeology, but some phrases ("awkward elegance") verge on contrived whimsy. Emotional descriptions lean abstract rather than visceral, bordering on machine-like stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements fit together cohesively for the most part, but the story prioritizes tone over narrative momentum. The brief length suits the poetic tone but undermines emotional investment in the character's journey.</comment>
