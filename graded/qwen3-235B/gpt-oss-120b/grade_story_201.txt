<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s impulsiveness and whimsy are consistently shown through rash decisions and symbolic gestures, but her motivation to "right a historical wrong" feels underdeveloped, lacking personal stakes to ground her actions beyond plot convenience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing compresses the quest’s progression, sacrificing depth for brevity; the method (tracking shooting stars) lacks internal logic (why do stars point to the vault?), but the story’s arc concludes cohesively, aligning Lyra’s song with the choir’s symbolic rebirth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid, layered sensory details (e.g., moss-slick steps, mist-touched starlight), merging the fortress’s decay with ethereal beauty; however, the "restless harmony" tone is inconsistently maintained, veering toward sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Poetic imagery (stars as "celestial breadcrumbs," shadows transformed into light) elevates the narrative, but emotional resonance is diluted by overt thematic declarations (e.g., "promise to return emotional inheritance") instead of organic subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the celestial-tracking method and "emotional inheritance" conceit, but purple prose ("centuries of unspoken sorrow") and formulaic phrases ("whimsical gestures") undercut the voice’s distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative integrates assigned elements efficiently, yet some (e.g., shooting stars) feel contrived rather than organic; the ending’s catharsis lingers emotionally, but thematic clarity is diluted by overcrowded symbolism.</comment>
