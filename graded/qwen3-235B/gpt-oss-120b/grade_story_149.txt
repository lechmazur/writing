<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's rebellion lacks deep integration with actions; motivations stated more than demonstrated through nuanced choices; reactions to objects feel symbolic but underdeveloped narratively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum relies on abrupt transitions; act progression feels forced despite thematic cohesion in the prophet's journey; pivotal moments (estrangement, flower's reanimation) lack structural buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich but inconsistent atmosphere; settings (study/laundromat) contrast strikingly but unevenly; sensory details are evocative but inconsistently applied to deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Poetic language elevates atmosphere; metaphors (decaying flower as hope) resonate, but emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on abstract imagery; theme of unity emerges but feels simplified within the compressed narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some fresh juxtapositions (laundromat as fate's crucible) undercut repetitive phrasing ("glimmering transitions") and tonal flourishes that lean toward artificial grandeur rather than earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>Conceptual ambition evident, but uneven execution between high-concept ideas and organic storytelling; thematic unity is suggested but not fully operationalized within the tight frame.</comment>
