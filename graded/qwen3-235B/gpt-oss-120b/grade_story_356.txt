<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond aesthetic traits; motivation is clear but lacks emotional weight. The 'wry warmth' informs actions mildly but avoids psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic action and poetic cause-effect, sacrificing strict logic for atmosphere. Pacing manages completeness but relies too heavily on abstraction over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in a decaying, sentient ship environment. Setting amplifies melancholic tone, though the 'cloud paths' concept clashes faintly with hard-edged space pirate imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density creates lingering resonance. The paradoxical 'gentle harshness' and lullaby-reprimand duality elevate thematic impact, though emotional engagement remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through surrealism but occasionally slips into poetic repetition (e.g., "warmly aloof," "gentle harshness") that borders on performative complexity. Time manipulation remains conceptually vague.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting mood piece rather than plot-driven narrative. Utilizes constraints effectively but prioritizes style over emotional immediacy.</comment>
