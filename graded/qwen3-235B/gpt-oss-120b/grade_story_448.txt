<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Corin's distrust and docility are present but underexplored; motivation feels slightly abstract despite clear surface-level rebellion, with actions aligning more with plot demands than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sewing machine's halt effectively triggers the plot pivot, but the accelerated transformation between brass candlestick and seashell strains internal logic coherence within the compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (soot, iron, flickering flame) create strong atmosphere, though the seashell's symbolic connection to the guild's industrial setting remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "shadows dance like halted stitches" show craft, but the ending relies too heavily on stating transformation rather than demonstrating its implications through concrete consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasionally ventures into florid descriptions ("soot-black beams breathe anew") that prioritize style over organic storytelling, with Corin's internal conflict resolved too neatly for emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels imposed rather than naturally emergent; elements serve symbolic functions well enough but occasionally strain logic (e.g., seashell-magic integration).</comment>
