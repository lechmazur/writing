<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (survival skills for villagers) feels external rather than organically tied to astral projecting. Internal conflict lacking despite supernatural ability. Compassion stated rather than demonstrated through specific character choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sudden revelation about the key drives concise plot. Pacing uneven – condensed timeframe creates narrative urgency but resolution feels abrupt. Fleeing through tunnel resolves external tension but lacks meaningful internal conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival provides vivid physical decay mirroring Mara’s metaphysical passage. Sensory details (lavender, rusted metal) immersive but occasionally overly ornate. Sun shadows as navigation device connects setting to character ability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (“river of ink,” “compassionate heartbeat”) elevate imagery but strain thematic weight. Astral plane shortcut vs. physical escape creates false tension dichotomy. Emotional resonance undercut by over-articulated concepts rather than lived moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>“Practiced spontaneity” and “unyielding compassion” read like checklist phrases rather than integrated themes. Purple prose distracts (“clutching a legendary artifact of her own making”). Astral projector trope lacks fresh subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but lack synergistic innovation. Forced connection between astral projection and village survival mechanics feels artificial. Concept of “forgotten medicines” as salvation is predictable. Lingering impression mostly atmospheric rather than thematic</comment>
