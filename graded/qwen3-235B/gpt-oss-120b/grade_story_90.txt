<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Circular structure from exile to redemption works within constraints; key revelations about scepter feel rushed; logical connections between tattoo-reading and political intrigue insufficiently established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory overload creates vivid but cohesive atmosphere; floating spa's surreal qualities enhance thematic tension; some descriptions (e.g., "turquoise clouds") verge on excessive ornamentation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich imagery undercut by occasionally self-indulgent prose ("whispered apology" tropes); character psychology remains surface-level; subversion of action-mystery tropes with kindness shows inventiveness despite occasional formulaic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine in service of theme but lack interdependence; tight word count strains relationship between personal redemption and political mystery; atmospheric consistency provides lingering resonance despite structural strain.</comment>
