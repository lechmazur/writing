<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's rashness is surface-level; motivations and transformations lack emotional anchoring. Actions hint at internal conflict but remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses through key elements, but the compressed arc sacrifices depth. Pacing manages momentum within constraints, though resolutions feel abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by clich√©d phrasing ("chorus of light," "whispered back"). Metaphors lean on familiar cosmic mysticism without subverting expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements integrated with effort, but some feel checklist-driven. The brevity serves poetic moments more than narrative clarity, leaving thematic threads frayed.</comment>
