<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is distinct but underdeveloped; the soul-broker's motivation and methods lack emotional or psychological depth despite intriguing conceptual integration of "persuasion" with reversed-label rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear structure driven by bottle-reading ritual feels complete within constraints, but the pivotal negotiation lacks visceral stakes or tension, making the resolution seem predetermined rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ethereal setting contains striking visual details (tea gardens as "static," rivers of recycled leaves) but struggles to ground the abstract concepts in sensory consistency or ecological logic that might enhance the eerie atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Melodic prose and symbolic richness elevate the narrative; the thematic interplay between memory, commerce, and loss shows depth, though emotional engagement is mediated through metaphor rather than earned empathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise executed with vivid, non-generic imagery (e.g., "wraiths with chains loosening at melody") avoids formulaic tropes, though some phrases ("tumbling words," "air filled with hum") strain toward poetics without achieving lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively binds most elements without over-explaining, but the core conflict remains abstract; the brevity serves the fable-like tone while leaving the thematic ambitions partially unfulfilled.</comment>
