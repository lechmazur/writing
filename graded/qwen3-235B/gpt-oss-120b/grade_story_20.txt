<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's disappointment and chronicling social movements are present but lack depth in motivations beyond poetic symbolism; actions align with abstract traits but lack personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a faint arc from reflection to release, but fragmented elements (carousel, celestial bodies) dilute momentum; coherence hinges on metaphor rather than narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically rich, with inverted waterfall and broken carousel enhancing surreal melancholy; sensory details are evocative but occasionally overwhelming.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (bridge, relics, motion vs. stagnation); ending ties character growth to universal themes, though emotional resonance leans on abstraction vs. concrete action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Originality in surreal elements (inverted waterfall, carousel) and thematic layering; slightly undercut by meandering prose and a few overwritten metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through tone and symbolism but struggles with pacing and underdeveloped plot progression; some elements feel inserted rather than organic.</comment>
