<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Presents a strong symbolic motif but offers little beyond surface-level characterization; motivation is stated rather than earned through action, and nonchalant tone undermines emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear structure works but lacks narrative tension; ignition of manuscript drives plot yet resolution feels too swift for the stakes, with cause-effect relationships implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Steampunk elements rendered through rich sensory details create immersion, though setting feels more decorative than thematically essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic resonance elevate craft, but emotional impact remains superficial; theme of art's power is present yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through vivid reinvention of tropes, though some poetic excesses verge on purple prose; originality strongest in synesthetic descriptions rather than structural innovations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack transformative interconnection; style transcends formula but thematic heft remains elusive despite atmospheric richness.</comment>
