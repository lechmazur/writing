<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on abstract descriptors without deep psychological exploration; phobia is acknowledged but insufficiently integrated into decision-making or growth. The "dance on the edge of madness" motivation lacks concrete emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc but falters in logic—knots releasing sea memories strain credibility within the pyramid setting; garage sales framing feels arbitrarily appended rather than organically connected to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere in the pyramid library creates tangible immersion; the mundanely spiritual tone through papyrus/incense juxtaposes compellingly with mystical elements, though "echoes in the dark" remain underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic imagery (net as "storm memories," dust as "ghostly fireflies") enhances impact; emotional resonance diluted by overreliance on abstract phrases like "quiet joy" rather than earned revelation. Theme of fear-to-art transformation is clear but simplistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains ornate phrasing that occasionally veers into self-indulgence ("pristine manuscript," "razor's edge of madness"); metaphors like the net's chant feel fresh, though the pyramid-garage sale juxtaposition risks thematic whiplash.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story remains technically cohesive but strained; elements coexist without fully harmonizing (stunt double profession adds little; garage sales feel disconnected from pyramid quest). Style is purposeful but occasionally obscures emotional immediacy.</comment>
