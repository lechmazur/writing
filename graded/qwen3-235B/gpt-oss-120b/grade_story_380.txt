<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (dream theft for identity repair, thunder as emotional catharsis) are clear but underdeveloped; mathematical challenges are mentioned but don't sufficiently shape decision-making. The act of stitching identity through stolen dreams shows thematic promise, but the emotional logic remains unexplored in favor of poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compact structure traces a complete arc from obsession to release, with the skyball sequence effectively bridging action and transcendence. Some transitions (e.g., spectral players' introduction) lack groundwork, but the central action of stealing dreams aligns tightly with the contained word limit's demands.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (flickering eyes, moth-wing pages, thunder's physicality) create a hauntingly tactile atmosphere. The treehouse's creaking organic structure mirrors Mara's unstable psyche, while the post-human timeframe deepens existential melancholy without overshadowing human-scale emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ('thunder as unmet yearning,' 'fragmented souls in dust') resonate with cumulative power. The recursive motif of shattered wholeness—album, library, self—elevates the narrative beyond surface plot. The final dissolution of the self transcends cliché through restrained, almost sacred prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre templates through the unique interplay of dream-thievery and skyball's ghostly persistence. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate phrasing ('whispers of worlds that never existed') but maintains tonal consistency. Emotional nuance emerges more through imagery than explicit psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically—skyball nostalgia fuels collective yearning, the treehouse's fragility mirrors Mara's psyche, the album's evolution from flimsy to weighty symbolizes thematic completion—though the mathematical challenge feels perfunctorily attached.</comment>
