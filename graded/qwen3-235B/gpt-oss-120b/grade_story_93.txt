<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rendered, but lacks psychological depth; motivations tied to sacred geometry feel abstract rather than emotionally rooted. Reactions to vintage cards are mechanical, not revealing organic personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is conceptually logical but underdeveloped; cause-effect relationships rely on speculative logic rather than organic narrative flow. Pacing lags in middle while attempting to reconcile archive collapse and pirate radio method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details like "embossed edges" and "static coordinates," creating vivid synesthetic resonance. Setting functions more as metaphorical container than lived-in space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "living diagram," "resonant mandala") creates memorable conceptual layers. Ending provides thematic closure but emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through fusion of archivist and digital decay motifs. Some transitions (e.g., elevator doors sealing as "final note") feel conceptually forced rather than psychologically authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but not emotionally; the archival crisis serves more as puzzle box than human experience. The brief format amplifies elegant abstraction at the cost of narrative grounding.</comment>
