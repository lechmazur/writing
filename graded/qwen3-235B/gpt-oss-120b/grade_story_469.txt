<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "logically emotional" trait is mentioned but underdeveloped; motivation to map tunnels hinted at but lacks visceral stakes. Uses child's key effectively as a symbol but inner conflicts remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a countdown-driven arc with logical cause-effect progression, but climax feels compressed. Overreaching and key mechanics resolve too neatly within tight constraints, sacrificing tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (iron tang, stone sighs, bioluminescence) but setting's connection to "whispering gallery" and empire remains underexplored, diluting worldbuilding potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (key as heartbeat/relic, mosaics as maps) and subtext about coexisting opposites (grandeur/modesty) reward reflection. Ending prioritizes thematic resonance over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Largely avoids overt clich√©s but contains occasionally overwritten phrases ("echoing whispering gallery," "weight of history"). Nuanced emotion is implied through action rather than told, but some descriptors lean ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements like countdown, key, and survival concept integrate effectively, but "whispering gallery" and garden scent feel more decorative than essential. Brief length is used purposefully, though thematic ambition occasionally outpaces execution.</comment>
