<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; motivation ("digital connection") is abstract but lacks personal stakes or emotional depth, with actions feeling more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot meanders with poetic imagery substituting for progression; the "wager" resolves too neatly without tension, undermining the "ruthless" aspect of the stated tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (marble, dust, light) effectively merge antiquity with modernity, though the interplay between ghosts and digital technology remains more atmospheric than logically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose contains memorable metaphors ("spectral fragments to bridge time") but relies on clich√©d emotional beats ("stone in chest") that dilute thematic poignancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose veers between hypnotic and overwrought (e.g., "organically humming heart"), with several awkward metaphors ("digital notification pinged on her hidden e-reader") disrupting immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</question><comment>Conceptually ambitious but structurally diffuse; thematic cohesion falters under underdeveloped conflicts and sentimental resolution that undercuts the "ruthless" promise.</comment>
