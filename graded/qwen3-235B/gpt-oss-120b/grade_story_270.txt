<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's 'humbly arrogant' nature is present but underexplored; motivation to 'harness the ephemeral' drives action but lacks emotional or psychological depth, relying on poetic abstraction over tangible motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear ritual-based plot arc with beginning (spell failure), middle (ritual execution), end (success), but pacing feels compressed; some transitions between actions (e.g., aligning globe with beam) lack cause-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through tactile details—cracked phonograph, salt air, trembling shelves—but the lighthouse-library duality could integrate more deeply with the core concept of isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (light as 'story of loss,' shadows as 'ancient scribes') elevate craft; ending balances cyclical inevitability and fragility of connection, though emotional resonance is muted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original imagery (e.g., 'sunrise over sea of glass') avoids cliché, but some lines ('whispered back into the void') lean toward familiar mystical tropes; emotional beats stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interconnect through theme, but the lighthouse's sentience and canyon's role feel conceptually underdeveloped; the brief length amplifies rather than obscures these gaps.</comment>
