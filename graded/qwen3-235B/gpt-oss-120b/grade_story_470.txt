<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rationale for motivation and action alignment present but lacks psychological depth; traits are surface-level rather than intrinsically tied to behavioral nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect chain with action-driven progression, but compressed arc feels slightly artificial; some transitions between key moments strain believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually rich setting lacks thematic integration; sensory details overwhelm rather than reveal character or narrative stakes; atmosphere occasionally feels decorative rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolic motifs partially offset slight thematic shallowness; ending succeeds but lacks emotional or philosophical resonance beyond surface mythic archetypes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imaginative core elements undercut by occasional stock phrases ("breathless longing") and overreliance on steampunk tropes; emotional beats occasionally stated rather than enacted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of fantastical elements with functional story architecture, but lacks transcendent vision; cohesive framework doesn't yet earn masterpiece status.</comment>
