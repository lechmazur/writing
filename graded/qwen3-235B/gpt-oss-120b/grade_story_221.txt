<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to step out of their shadow shape's the plot, but lacks substantial backstory or emotional depth; interactions with ghost captain feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through amber's mystical properties and family tradition, but transitions between key moments lack organic flow, creating pacing issues in compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of the decaying carnival and spectral elements create a haunting atmosphere, but integration of the "half-written letter" timeframe feels abstract rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., amber as frozen memory) and thematic exploration of legacy/decay elevate the narrative, though emotional beats occasionally rely on lyrical abstraction over concrete emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of ghost-lore and carnival decay avoids familiar tropes, though the ghost captain's role occasionally veers toward spectral clich√©s; language is lush but not overly indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists, but reliance on poetic density over character-focused narrative diminishes structural precision; thematic resonance lingers but feels intentionally ambiguous rather than deeply earned.</comment>
