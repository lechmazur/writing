<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Mara’s solitude and motivation to resuscitate the garden are clear and interwoven with her identity as an artist. Weakness: Her internal conflict lacks complexity beyond her stated resolve, leaving her emotional depth somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: The plot flows organically from Mara’s discovery of confessions to her artistic resurrection of the garden. Weakness: The tight word limit compresses her transformation, feeling slightly rushed without deeper tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strength: The exo-atmospheric garden’s surrealism is vividly rendered through sensory details (phosphorescent vines, whispering gravity). Weakness: The "borrowed books" timeframe is underdeveloped, weakening its thematic connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Lyrical prose and metaphors (e.g., "ink of confessions") evoke emotional resonance. Weakness: The ending’s "tears of intimate separation" leans toward vague poignance rather than earned emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strength: Original combinations of abstract concepts (e.g., "gravity’s jokes") avoid cliché. Weakness: Over-reliance on ornate descriptors like "battled notepad, frayed like forgotten constellations" risks veering into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: The story’s metaphor of art as resurrection lingers. Weakness: The integration of all elements (notepad, borrowed books) feels occasionally disjointed, prioritizing style over coherence.</comment>
