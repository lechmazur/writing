<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weak emotional interiority; actions align with surface motivation but lack psychological complexity or evolution. Vow to sea gods feels imported rather than earned through character history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows toward thematic resolution but lacks tension beyond rhythmic escalation. Pacing uneven in brief segments; sacred chant’s payoff feels abrupt despite strong cyclical closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory alchemy transforms zero-gravity hall into mythic liminal space. Dance hall’s luminous disorder and clock’s paradoxical chime create unforgettable tension between decay and transcendence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (coral veins as earth’s capillaries, armor singing vows) elevate without pretension. Ending achieves mythic resonance through compressed subtext about redemption-as-memory rather than conquest.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes like “starlight rewriting constellations” risk preciousness but are grounded by concrete imagery. Moments of abstraction (“holy chaos”) verge on vagueness but serve thematic urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Cohesion achieved through tone and recurring glyphs rather than plotting. Assigned elements serve as thematic anchor points but occasionally feel like checklist items rather than organic integrations.</comment>
