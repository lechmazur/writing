<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is a collage of metaphors without psychological depth; motivations are stated, not dramatized. Assigned attributes shape poetic gestures but lack emotional specificity or behavioral consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as a symbolic tableau; action is static and repetitive. Assigned elements create circularity rather than momentum, undermining narrative progression within the tight constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative setting fails to translate into tangible stakes. Sensory details prioritize surrealism over functional world-building; atmosphere doesn't pressure character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes momentarily elevate the text, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. Conceptual ambition exceeds the execution of thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates, with recycled metaphors (e.g., "whispered across galaxies") and inconsistent logic. Tone shifts feel contrived; lacks human-scale emotional stakes beneath cosmic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story hinges on assigned elements but struggles to weave them into a unified whole. Style occasionally distracts from substance; lacks urgency despite poetic aspirations.</comment>
