<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character acts as a vessel for themes but lacks psychological complexity; motivations are conceptually clear but underdeveloped through action; first-person voice is lyrical but generic, indistinguishable from a generic poetic narrator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a dreamlike logic of images and motifs, but lacks clear stakes or rising tension; abrupt shifts from obituary writing to revolution feel unearned within word limit; symbolic completeness sacrificed for compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric imagery creates immersive absurdity (bookshelf world, sentient mask), but concrete sensory details remain scarce; atmosphere effectively reinforces futility and rebellion themes through surreal setting contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical resonance (revolution as recited eulogies, memory as organic rebellion); striking originality in subverting "elegy" concept; some emotional impact diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but occasionally indulges in dense poetic abstraction; metaphors (bookshelf as imprisonment) are fresh but sometimes overly elaborate; emotional undercurrents present but not fully excavated beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements cohere in thematic unity but strain narrative logic; brevity enhances poetic impact yet undermines character/narrative depth; conceptually ambitious but imperfectly realized within constraints.</comment>
