<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stagnant character psychology; "stubbornness" is stated rather than demonstrated through distinct choices. Motivation to outsmart dark self remains abstract, with minimal emotional stakes beyond conceptual stakes of "memory."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure prioritizes poetic imagery over plot progression; decoding tooth marks as map feels arbitrary. Resolution via flute's vibration opening a compartment lacks logical groundwork despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elevated setting provides visual texture, but "cautious enchantment" tonal ambiguity isn't fully reconciled with darker mythical elements like memory-stealing dragons. Sensory details unevenâ€”some lyrical, others inert.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasional striking metaphors ("cold sand past pressing into palm") elevate, but emotional resonance diluted by exposition-heavy narration. Central theme of memory as both weapon and wound partially achieved through symbolic objects.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors and abstract conflicts lean toward generic mythification. Some fresh integration of flute's traumatic history, but frequent vague phrasing ("dark reflection," "fissure in timeline") undermines credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story leans on high-concept elements to mask underdeveloped thematic cohesion. While some symbols interlock (label/flute), core premise feels contrived rather than revelatory.</comment>
