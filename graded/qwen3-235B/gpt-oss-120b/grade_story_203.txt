<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lack of specific character history weakens motivation. Trembling hands imply stage fright, but how does this fear manifest psychically? "Defiant hush" contradicts "stage fright" without emotional reconciliation. Motivation to overcome inheritance is stated rather than earned through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from ritual to exorcism in logical sequence, but pivotal moments (locker opening, debris dissolution) lack technical/spatial clarity within tight word limits. Key turning as catalyst feels underdeveloped. Epiphany about "truth" arrives suddenly without earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orbital debris field effectively juxtaposes celestial decay with potential renewal. Strong sensory contrast between "synthetic rot" and wildflower "scent of earth." Atmospheric pressure inconsistent - locker's heartbeat sound violates vacuum physics, undermining immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("sound thickening air," "micro-satellite shards") create visceral impact. Overreliance on abstract duality (truth/lie, hush/volume) weakens specificity. Ending's thematic resonance undercut by overly direct proclamation of legacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unique fusion of exorcism and space debris avoids genre clich√©s but lapses into poetic overreach: "stage-light filament," "false inheritance" repeated too frequently. Emotional beats ("hope pressed into permanence") lean on metaphor rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Concepts fit together technically, but strained through-threads. Assigned elements often feel stacked rather than organically interwoven (why must this confrontation occur at "toy assembly stations"?). Lingering questions about lineage mechanics outweigh thematic rewards.</comment>
