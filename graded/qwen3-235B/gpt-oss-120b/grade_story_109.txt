<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of internal conflict weakens transformation; motivation shifts abruptly without sufficient emotional groundwork. Coldness feels more like aesthetic than psychological trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented structure with underdeveloped cause-effect between altars; pacing uneven due to compressed word count. Resolution feels tacked-on rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Melancholic atmosphere through sensory details, but genre collision between knightly tradition and modern secret agency creates tonal whiplash. Symbolism competes with setting logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("ink of herbs," "rebellion's voice") but uneven showing-telling balance. Subtext about preserving cultural memory partially transcends surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing ("whispered through generations") and predictable emotional beats. Several images (painting memories, armor softening) feel conventionally allegorical rather than original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function individually but narrative cohesion suffers - the knight's arc and secret agency framework operate in parallel rather than intersecting meaningfully.</comment>
