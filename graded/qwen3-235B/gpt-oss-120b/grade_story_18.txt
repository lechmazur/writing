<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's telepathic empathy drives action but lacks internal conflict or growth; motivations implied rather than developed; personification of the statue feels conceptually thin despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Circular structure emphasizes atmosphere over plot; weatherizing the square creates momentum but resolution feels abstract and non-specific; pacing lingers on description at the expense of narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually rich but functional details like "steam vents hissing" and "brass tables" ground the setting effectively; some elements (ink sigils, amber glow) strain plausibility within the mechanical world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like "ink-flow method" and "tragic joy" resonate; ending resonates thematically but lacks specific emotional stakes; shows promise in balancing paradoxes but execution remains impressionistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("melancholy optimism"); symbolic coherence undermined by phrases like "bittersweet spark" that feel generic; subverts clich√©s in tone but not structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Imaginative core ideas diluted by diffuse execution; atmospheric cohesion outweighs narrative purpose; requires tighter integration of elements to justify literary excellence at the sentence level.</comment>
