<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue manuscripts is clear but lacks depth in showing how her 'dutiful' role conflicts with rebellion; interactions with Joren reveal some nuance but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent but strained by the word limit, with key transitions (e.g., irrigation plan) feeling rushed; action sequences rely on poetic resonance over logical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is lushly detailed but overly ornate; atmosphere leans on vivid but inconsistent metaphors (cloud-swaying lanterns, golden hues) that occasionally overshadow narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "lullaby of wind") and cyclical imagery elevate the narrative; ending lacks emotional depth, but themes of balance hint at subtext about duty vs. imagination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in combining aeronautics, floating festivals, and manuscript theft; prose occasionally overloads on similes ("sunrise on silk") but avoids clich√©s through inventive setting logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements coexist but lack narrative synergy; the floating spa and manuscripts feel conceptually linked, but "forgotten dance" as a theme remains underexplored beyond superficial callbacks.</comment>
