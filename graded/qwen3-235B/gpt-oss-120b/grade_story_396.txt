<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters are stylized but underdeveloped; Lila's "charming forgetfulness" occasionally undermines plot coherence rather than deepening character. Marcel's aristocratic detachment lacks emotional nuance despite clear role in plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots on improbable yet internally consistent logic. Resolution feels perfunctory - negotiations lack dramatic tension. Final performance sequence visually striking but thematically underdeveloped arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vibrant sensory textures create immersive atmosphere. Abandoned district vs. polished fair dichotomy evocatively rendered. Champagne vault's subterranean coolness contrasts surface decay but could better reflect character psyches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical resonance (fleeting beauty vs. preservation) lingers. Overreliance on telling ("cultural clash", "quiet pride") weakens emotional impact. Ambiguous ending lacks thematic payoff despite poetic imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stained-glass fungi symbiosis inventive but some phrasing ("street-born miracle", "passionate indifference") feels curated rather than organic. Sensory descriptions veer into lavish abstraction without narrative justification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>High-concept premise and stylistic flourishes compensate for compressed emotional core. Assigned elements function as thematic anchors but occasional contrivance undermines narrative urgency. Lingering questions about vault's workers remain unexplored.</comment>
