<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character voice remains generic; motivations are implied but not deeply embodied. The scholar's "amiable" trait isn't substantiated through action, and her "humble rebellion" feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently through symbolic beats, but transitions between the waiting room, lighthouse mechanics, and supernatural elements feel compressed. The grant's arrival as a catalyst lacks emotional preparation, and the resolution hinges on abstract imagery rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from tactile details (creaking timbers, vibrating ink) but suffers from inconsistent spatial logic. The "doubly singular" beams and "haunted" elements aren't fully realized, leaving the setting thematically suggestive but physically unmoored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Storytelling shines in its metaphorical alignment of crosswords with historical synthesis, and the final "double helix" image is striking. However, over-reliance on abstract verbs ("vibrate," "pulse") dilutes tangible emotional impact, and the ending feels conceptually elegant but spiritually inert.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attempts "fresh" combinations (crosswords as archaeological tools) but falters under AI-trope suspicion. Phrases like "whispered lore" and "vibrate through fissures" border on clich√©, while thematic insistence on "doubleness" feels algorithmically imposed rather than organically thematic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>The story hangs together as an aesthetic object but struggles to transcend its component parts. Assigned elements function as symbolic baggage rather than organic narrative drivers, creating cohesion through linguistic polish rather than emotional or logical necessity.</comment>
