<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character traits like 'elegantly clumsy' and the dried flower crown are vividly rendered but motivations (liberation through ghost cataloguing) lack psychological depth or friction sufficient to anchor the ethereal themes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Limited by its brevity, the plot achieves a cohesive arc but pacing feels compressed; the ghost encounter catalyzes change abruptly without sufficient groundwork for emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered: the sand castle lab's fragility mirrors Mara's inner state; sensory details (gritty sand, silent machinery) create a hauntingly tactile world that elevates the story's metaphorical weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (ghosts as 'unfinished sighs') and structural mirroring between sand castles and elevator shafts elevate the thematic cohesion; some abstract emotional beats risk vagueness, but lyrical prose lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dryly poetic tone avoids clich√© but occasionally teeters into ornate abstraction ('forgotten pauses'); subversion of 'haunting' tropes works well, though some metaphors strain toward profundity without earned emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a resonant whole despite their density; the marriage of Mara's occupation and her ghostly preoccupation feels inventive, though certain components (lunchbreak ghost-hunting) remain underexploited.</comment>
