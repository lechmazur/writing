<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Surface-level motivation stated but thinly woven into actions; timidity contrasts with decisive movement without sufficient interiority or tension to reconcile the disparity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structural arc present but strained; scoreboard as narrative pivot feels conceptually ingenious yet under-explained, creating a logical gap between ritual and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, sensory dissonance between industrial decay and mythic grandeur builds palpable mood, though the temple's transformation into a sanctuary lacks layered historical justification.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery (scoreboard as grief-meter, weaving as healing) elevates themes, but resolution’s speed undercuts emotional gravity in favor of symbolic neatness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Recurring metaphors occasionally tilt toward abstraction (“feathered hope”), yet the unique fusion of arcade/factory/temple avoids total familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock conceptually, but the story’s brevity forces sketchy transitions; the thematic ambition outpaces the narrative’s ability to fully reconcile its metaphors.</comment>
