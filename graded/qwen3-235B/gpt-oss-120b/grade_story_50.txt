<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is consistent but underdeveloped; Mara’s motivation as "unconvinced missionary" lacks grounding, her transformation feels abrupt, and the symbolic weight of objects overshadows nuanced psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels compressed; decoding the piano’s cipher drives action logically, yet some beats (e.g., sudden faith shift) lack sufficient buildup within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through vivid, cohesive imagery (shimmering dunes, piano’s wind-music); atmosphere deeply intertwines with themes of fragility and hidden truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking lyricism and symbolic resonance (doubt as magic conduit) elevate the story, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract introspection over concrete character-driven moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise and rich metaphors (e.g., "concealed faith as compass") are undercut by sporadic over-ornamentation and a slightly formulaic arc of skepticism-to-belief.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion hinges on atmospheric brilliance and thematic ambition, though uneven pacing and underexplored character depth prevent full narrative mastery.</comment>
