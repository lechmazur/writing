<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving tradition) is clear but remains abstract; actions driven by emotional symbolism rather than tangible personal stakes. While the core trait shapes the narrative, internal complexity and unique voice remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc with distinct phases, but pacing feels fragmented under the word limit. The coffee-stain divination feels abrupt rather than earned, weakening causal transitions between key moments like the YES revelation and the library's activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport rendered with precise, haunting imagery (rusted conveyor constellations, dark coffee as a future canvas). The setting's decay powerfully mirrors the dying tradition, though integration of tactile sensations beyond visual descriptors remains minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story possesses poetic beauty and potent metaphors (coffee stains as destiny, button as unity symbol) but occasionally privileges lyricism over emotional immediacy. The theme of knowledge-as-connection is consistent yet occasionally drowned in ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Creative in concept but occasionally succumbs to dense abstraction ("fractal sorrow," "luminous corridor") that veers toward purple prose. The divination method and cosmic resolution feel more artistically intentional than formulaic, though emotional depth could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a unifying theme but occasionally strain under the weight of excessive symbolism. The 500-word frame reveals structural seams; ideas resonate more strongly than emotional engagement. Lingering impact lies in its conceptual ambition rather than character intimacy.</comment>
