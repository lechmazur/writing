<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has textured motivations and internal contradictions, but emotional depth remains surface-level. While scars and ghosts offer symbolic weight, reactions lack visceral specificity and evolved agency beyond poetic fatalism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mystical trigger-task-completion arc, but the secret agent escape route concept clashes with the mystical tone. Some logical gaps (e.g., coin sigil mechanics) weaken the cause-effect coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric writing blends mystical and industrial elements through sensory details, but the juxtaposition of fantasy wishing well with espionage infrastructure creates tonal dissonance rather than intentional contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("pain measured like weight") and layered themes of inherited trauma elevate the craft. The ending lacks emotional catharsis but uses the coins and scars as effective symbolic throughlines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality exists in the scars-as-mechanic concept, but AI-like tendencies emerge through repetitive phrasing ("intensely relaxed"). Some atmospheric details feel generically atmospheric rather than purposefully chosen.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story coalesces around core scars/coins/ghosts motifs but forces integration of disparate elements like espionage infrastructure. The brevity works for poetic brevity but undermines fuller thematic exploration.</comment>
