<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (honoring impossible promise) drives action, but Lira's personality remains static and underexplored beyond abstract determination; emotional reactions are hinted at but lack depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (rain ritual culminating in spectral encounter), but pacing feels slightly compressed; the rain-pattern method is poetically justified but lacks internal logic; the timeframe constraint tightens structure but dilutes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ship graveyard's decay resonates with themes of memory and resurrection; sensory details (salt, rust, Morse-like rain) immerse readers, though cosmic intimacy tone occasionally strains naturalism with heavy-handed abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense lyricism and conceptual metaphors (rain as temporal compass) are striking, but reliance on overwrought phrases ("pulse of the universe") undermines potency; theme (honoring promises through resonance) is clear but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose alternates between vivid originality (rain as Morse code) and ornate abstraction ("cosmic intimacy"); avoids formulaic structure but occasionally lapses into poetic vagueness that obscures emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified, melancholic parable, but some assigned components (e.g., timeframe) feel externally imposed rather than organically narrative-driven; lingers conceptually but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
