<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The alien liaison's "righteously flawed" trait is consistently present but underexplored; his motivation and actions lack psychological nuance, relying more on symbolic resonance than human/relatable behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causal chain (music aligns with glyph, vault opens) is logical but compressed; pacing balances setup/development/wrap-up effectively within constraints, though some transitions feel schematic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create strong immersion, but blending Roman architecture with alien elements lacks rigorous internal logic; "fierce tenderness" tone inconsistently applied to setting interactions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent use of lyrical metaphors elevates craft, yet some phrasing veers into abstract vagueness; theme of fear/revelation is clear but lacks subtextual complexity to sustain repeated readings.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original in concept-fusion (aliens/ancient Rome), but certain elements (organ-glyph resonance) border on mystical deus ex machina; emotional beats occasionally flattened by poetic abstraction rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements generally serve the narrative, though the bathhouse's "reborn" quality and organ's centrality strain credulity; prose style is distinctive but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative precision.</comment>
