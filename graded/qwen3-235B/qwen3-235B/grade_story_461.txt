<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Explorer’s irate nature is surface-level; generational trauma depth is strong but lacks nuanced exploration of her motivations beyond revenge/healing. Dialogue reveals character, but inner logic feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure is tight, with clear arc and cause-effect between pendant use and resolution. Pacing is efficient but could use slightly smoother transitions between memory/real world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber-lit study and childhood bedroom use vivid, chilling sensory details to mirror emotional states. Atmosphere amplifies themes of silence and legacy without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heartbeat motif and dragonfly symbolism masterfully intertwine with trauma cycles. Dialogue crackles with subtext; ending transcends plot to imply ongoing healing. Emotions shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes—”static magic,” recursive generational conflict, and flawed relic feel inventive. Language is stylistically controlled without flourish; emotional resonance emerges organically from interactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates masterful synthesis of constraints into cohesive, reflective narrative. Leaves lingering questions about legacy and stillness while fully utilizing word limit for emotional payoff.</comment>
