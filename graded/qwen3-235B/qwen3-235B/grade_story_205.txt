<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually intriguing but inconsistently embodied through action; the cynical weariness is stated rather than fully dramatized, and the sister's emotional connection to her brother's cameo lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through symbolic arc completion (burying/transforming the secret), but pacing stumbles during the spectral king's sudden appearance; the action-object relationships feel somewhat contrived by word-count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creative atmosphere undermined by overreliance on "swamp" clich√©s (methane bubbles as laughter); fireflies as living narrative devices work effectively, but sensory details occasionally prioritize aesthetics over worldbuilding logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (truth as strangled vegetation, secrets as buried seeds) and haunting imagery elevate the narrative; the ending resonates as cyclical yet transformative, balancing lyricism with emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by faintly AI-like tendencies: excessive metaphor density ("light and terrible" laughter), vague descriptors like "ancient and waiting," and occasional emotional abstraction that prioritizes poetic phrasing over human specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Story achieves atmospheric cohesion despite its elements' occasional disconnect (the timeframe concept feels arbitrarily placed); the "delicate warrior" paradox and secret-obsession theme resonate memorably within the tight constraints.</comment>
