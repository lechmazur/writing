<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Claustrophobia shapes actions but lacks visceral, consistent embodiment; motivations tie to backstory but aren't fully tested within the confined setting; voice retains individuality through poetic introspection but occasionally strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot centers on small, symbolic actions driving emotional resolution; momentum dips during dense description; circular structure (glasses left behind/claustrophobia conquered) provides cohesion within tight word limit, though conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting merges mystical and mundane with vivid, layered details; atmosphere of fragile equilibrium mirrors character psychology; sensory immersion (jam tang, bamboo hum) deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (marmalade, pressure) and cyclical structure elevate thematic cohesion; emotional undercurrents rely on subtext and atmosphere; ending lingers but lacks visceral punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally over-embellishes (eel claustrophobia, "viscous silence"); metaphors fresh yet border on preciousness; emotional nuance shown through objects more than lived reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around fragility and healing; brief length emphasizes symbolic economy; tonal consistency and precise imagery suggest intentional design, though some character and plot beats remain underexplored.</comment>
