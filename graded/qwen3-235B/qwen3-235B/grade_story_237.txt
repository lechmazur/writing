<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivations (heartbreak, destiny) implied but not deeply explored. "Proudly humble" described but not fully embodied in nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tight structure lacks clear cause-effect logic. Ending ties to beginning via dice motif, but abrupt shifts (e.g., backstory of child) disrupt pacing and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative details (dying star, shattered viewport) create mood, but bullet trains and space pirates inhabit dissonant worlds not fully reconciled. Sensory immersion uneven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (destiny as mosaic) and subtext about lineage/choice resonate, but overwritten passages dilute impact. Ending evokes ambiguity without sufficient payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of genealogy/space opera avoids formulaic tropes. Sensory detail specific but occasionally overdetermined. Emotional nuance (grief as "alarm bells") feels earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesion amid eclectic elements mostly achieved through poetic throughlines, though some connections (e.g., clockmakers) feel underexploited. Thematic ambition exceeds execution.</comment>
