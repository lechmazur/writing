<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s rigidity and analytical nature drive his arc, but emotional shifts feel abrupt; motivations align with assigned traits, though the final transformation lacks sufficient internal tension to fully justify the shift from steel to empathy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a cryptic mystery driving Elias to the bulb, but the compressed word limit strains logical progression; the connection between analyzing adhesive and triggering spectral events feels contrived, and the ending’s thematic resolution is rushed despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere merges graveyard decay with occult-tech; sensory descriptors (hissing vines, trembling roots) immerse readers. The greenhouse’s defiance and the bulb’s “memory” elevate setting beyond backdrop, merging it with the core concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (filament as empathy, greenhouse as emotional crucible) and thematic cohesion (rigidity vs. vulnerability) elevate the narrative. The ending’s simplicity—carrying the bulb into dusk—evokes lingering emotion, though deeper subtext about grief remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally borders on purple prose (“threads of gold weaving a cocoon”); some transitions feel mechanical. The fusion of Tesla’s science and witchcraft is inventive, though the emotional climax leans on exposition (“Empathy wasn’t weakness”) rather than fully realized subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically resonant whole, though the rapid transformation feels compressed rather than deliberate. The brevity works for poetic impact but undermines the complexity expected of a story aiming to “revolutionize” through quiet change.</comment>
