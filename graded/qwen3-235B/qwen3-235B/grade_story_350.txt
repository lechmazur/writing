<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thalia’s motivation (uncovering truth) is clear, but her emotional shifts between grief, anger, and revelation lack nuanced transitions. Her puppeteering skills tie into the plot but feel underexplored as a metaphor for manipulation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The puzzle event’s riddle and the temple discovery drive the plot cohesively, but the tight word limit strains the complexity of the family secret’s unraveling. The cause-effect chain weakens slightly in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (burnt myrrh, shuddering walls) and the crumbling temple amplify the eerie, introspective mood. The “back-alley” qualifier for Thalia feels disconnected from the mythic setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., stitched tears singing, frescoes unraveling) and layered themes of truth/deception elevate the story. Some emotions (e.g., her screams) risk being told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of stamps and constellations is inventive, but the “symphonies of truth” concept occasionally veers into abstraction. The father’s betrayal twist avoids predictability but strains believability subtly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements contribute to the narrative, but some (e.g., Greek temple) feel more symbolic than integral. The story’s length sacrifices deeper exploration of Thalia’s psychology.</comment>
