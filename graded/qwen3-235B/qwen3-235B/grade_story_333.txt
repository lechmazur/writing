<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve traditions aligns with actions but lacks depth beyond archetypal rebellion; bitterness shown through dialogue but inner conflicts underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear descent-into-vault arc with thematic payoff, but resolution feels rushed; cause-effect logic holds despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere brilliantly evoked via sensory details (smell of petrichor, shifting architecture) but the "between storms" timeframe only loosely ties to thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (fear as mortar, truth as rebuilding) are resonant; themes of memory and tradition conveyed through action, though some phrasing veers toward abstraction over emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with inventive concepts (living blueprints, confession-as-key) but occasionally succumbs to ornate phrasing ("braided bitterness") that distances emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively (motivation shapes plot, setting mirrors theme); ending lingers thematically, though brevity slightly undermines full emotional payoff.</comment>
