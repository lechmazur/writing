<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Well-structured progression through poetic riddles creates momentum. Slight pacing unevenness in transition to cavern revelations, but cyclical framing provides satisfying closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lush sensory alchemy - rusted gears' whisper, bioluminescent fungi, humming soil - creates palpable decay-meets-renewal atmosphere that becomes a character in itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids sword-and-sorcery tropes through unique fusion of evolutionary science and poetic magic. Descriptions remain purposeful despite lyrical prose, never veering into florid excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Elements merge organically into philosophical whole. Concise format amplifies thematic compression rather than limiting depth, particularly in evocative final ascent.</grade>
