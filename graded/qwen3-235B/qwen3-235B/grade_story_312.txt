<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Agoraphobia shapes actions but lacks psychological depth; inherited duty drives plot but character’s emotional arc feels rushed and insufficiently nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mechanically cohesive (snuffbox triggers plot), but the mystical resolution feels contrived; pacing uneven, especially between dunes sequence and abrupt office conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, oppressive sensory details (mildew, dunes) create visceral atmosphere; the setting meaningfully informs emotional states and symbolic burdens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (rain as Morse, dunes as choir) elevate theme of cyclical fate; ending resolves plot but underexplores existential implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ambitious imagery occasionally lapses into florid abstraction ("rain’s rhythm syncopated, insistent"); originality in heirloom symbolism offsets formulaic "hero’s journey" undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements serve story but cohesion strains under high-concept density; brevity sharpens impact yet leaves thematic threads unresolved.</comment>
