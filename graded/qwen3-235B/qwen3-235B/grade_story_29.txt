<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent with his "cleverly naive" attribute, but emotional depth feels truncated by the word limit. His transformation is evident, yet his internal psychology remains somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a tight arc with logical cause-effect, but the climax resolves too abruptly to fully satisfy the built-up tension within the constraints. Pacing is generally controlled.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and atmospheric cohesion; every setting element (maze, orchard, machine) deepens the mood and thematic resonance. The time constraint enhances urgency without sacrificing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance through lyrical metaphors and subtext about regret's duality. The endingâ€™s thematic closure is satisfying, but some internalized trauma lacks "show-don't-tell" nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls with fresh imagery, but risks overwrought poeticism in spots. Character logic (e.g., sudden understanding of frequency syncing) leans simplistic despite the mystical context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates all elements, though some interactions feel contrived (jigsaw/machine synergy). The bittersweet tone lingers, suggesting depth beyond the surface, but emotional payoff is slightly diminished by brevity.</comment>
