<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but sometimes vague; the shift from stamp collecting to seeking magic lacks emotional depth and psychological realism despite lyrical descriptions</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maintains overall cohesion across elements, cleverly interweaving stamps, carnival, and magic, though some connections feel poetically suggestive rather than tightly logical</comment>
