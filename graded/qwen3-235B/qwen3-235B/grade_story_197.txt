<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (penance) is clear but underexplored emotionally; actions align with guilt-driven purpose but lack psychological nuance beyond surface-level atonement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through puzzle-solving and nightmare battles, but the sticky-note logic feels arbitrary; cohesive arc exists but pacing stumbles during the titan confrontation's abrupt escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere via sensory details (ash-flake dissolutions, static languages), but the yggdrasil-tree-worldbuilding lacks internal consistency; setting enhances tone more than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and subtext (grief as hive, lullabies as cosmic repair) elevate impact; the ending's ambiguity about redemption resonates, though dense prose occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of mythic and mundane elements avoids clich√©s; sticky notes as mystical coordinates feel inventive but occasionally slip into ornate abstraction; no detectable AI-patterns, but some phrases risk poetic overload.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements form a self-contained mythos that lingers, though thematic threads (e.g., widow's hive) are underdeveloped; the brief length amplifies poetic density but weakens character/plot resolution depth.</comment>
