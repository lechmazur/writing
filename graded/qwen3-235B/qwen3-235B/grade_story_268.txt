<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character exhibits strong motivation through trauma and vengeance quest, but remains archetypal rather than deeply individualized. Actions align with motivation but lack human nuance in handling guilt and trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows clear vengeance arc with logical cause-effect, but compression of 500 words leaves middle underdeveloped. Beginning and ending connect effectively through symbolic motif of absorbed screams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Disturbing postwar atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details about silence, dust, shattered reflections. Setting enhances theme and creates immersive mood, though some environmental specifics feel generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors and symbolism elevate storytelling. The screaming silence motif and bead-as-memory-cipher create lasting impact. Style balances poetic language with narrative clarity to create memorable, affecting story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrases feel formulaic ("artfully clumsy") and emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements more than shown nuance. Original concepts (screams-as-burdens) redeem slightly predictable vengeance structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesion across required elements stronger than average, with meaningful thematic connections between war trauma and supernatural elements. Brief length feels purposeful but restricts deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
