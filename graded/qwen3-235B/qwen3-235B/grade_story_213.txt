<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters driven by clear motives but lack inward psychological depth; sentinel's resolve is compelling, but the intern's sudden complicity feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clever framing and tight causality, but pacing strains under swift transitions (intern's radicalization) and compressed 400-500 word resolution risks undercutting emotional heft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sharp contrasts between decadent ballroom and sterile lab amplify tension; sensory details (shattered glass, green wave) immerse but underutilize the photosynthesis concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors cut deep (algae as stories, detonation as archival justice); the closing lines resonate with thematic weight and poetic urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avant-garde tone avoids clich√©; the "delightfully strange" surfaces through biochemical lyricism rather than artificial embellishments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements fuse into a cohesive, haunting whole; the wedding-as-battlefield premise is daringly original, leaving questions about legacy and truth.</comment>
