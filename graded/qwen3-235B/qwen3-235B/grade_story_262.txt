<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations exist but lack psychological depth; internal conflict is implied but not fully explored. The "righteously flawed" attribute shapes actions but feels under-examined in terms of personal cost.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but suffer from compressed pacing; key transitions (e.g., floor shifting) feel abrupt despite word constraints. The organ-tile resonance concept drives structure effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details. The bathhouse's historical resonance amplifies both plot and thematic tension between entropy and preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echoes of existential dread and cultural preservation create emotional resonance. Poetic flourishes enhance but occasionally overshadow narrative clarity. The ending resolves core conflict while leaving philosophical questions open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work in concert to explore memory's survival through hybridity. The brevity feels purposeful, balancing wonder with melancholy. Lingers thematically but could deepen character specificity.</comment>
