<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (saving daughter), but the brewer’s internal psychology remains opaque despite poetic descriptions; motivations tie to actions but lack emotional layers beyond grief.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc from labors to sanctuary, but the compressed pacing leaves pivotal transitions (e.g., drinking the brew, entering sanctuary) underdeveloped; cause-effect logic is present but strained by thin explanations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, blending dystopian decay and haunting beauty through vivid sensory details (neon winds, burnt honey); the circus tent’s decay mirrors the brewer’s fractured psyche effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (photo frame as map, lullabies as code) and cyclical structure powerfully; emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on ornate metaphor, but the ending’s recursive imagery lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-writing pitfalls (clichés, flat dialogue) but verges on "purple prose" with excessive poetic flourishes; tonal consistency is strong, though some phrases (e.g., "feral elegance") feel forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Story coheres around key elements but strains under word constraints; themes (fatherhood, analog resistance) emerge clearly, yet the brevity leaves the sanctuary payoff underexplored.</comment>
