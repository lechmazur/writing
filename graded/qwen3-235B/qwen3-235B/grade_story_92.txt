<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (sister's tuition) is clear but underexplored; his "carefully careless" demeanor shows through actions, but emotional nuance is thin. The silent agreement lacks personal stakes beyond surface obligations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight cycle with clear beginning/end framing (sunset to twilight), but the supernatural mechanics remain opaque. Pacing moves deliberately yet coherently within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through visceral sensory details (crushing lilies, bleeding sky, ink-like shadows). The haunted setting merges organically with the botanical decay and eerie silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (botanical nightmares as fear manifestations) and resonant symbolism (vanilla biscuits as currency). Ending satisfies by reinforcing the thematic pact cycle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in merging high-society dog walking with supernatural horror. Avoids full AI-ness through specific details, though some phrasing (e.g., "open wounds") verges on familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates required elements while maintaining a haunting, almost mythic quality. The brevity amplifies tension rather than limiting it, albeit with slight thematic overstatement in final lines.</comment>
