<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (archiving weather, redefining family) tied to muteness and dummy dynamic, but backstory feels somewhat superficial despite impactful moments like disownment and dummy's agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from diner to beach climax, with sleeve/map as key device, but phone booth's sudden appearance and transition to strangers lacks sufficient scaffolding within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Parallel universe beach's turquoise tides and fractal umbrella are vivid; atmospheric sensory details (warm sleeve crinkles, electrode vibrations) enhance mood without overwhelming narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (storms as familial bonds, sleeve as blankness-to-belonging) and theme resonates emotionally; ending avoids clich√© by showing growth rather than stating it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original framing of weather as universe-folding tool, ventriloquism as literal/metaphorical voice struggle, and family-as-archivists avoids genre tropes; only minor purple prose in "frothy origami."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements tightly woven (e.g., sleeve's UV map justifies diner timing), though tonal shifts (euphoric agitation) occasionally strain coherence despite thematic purpose.</comment>
