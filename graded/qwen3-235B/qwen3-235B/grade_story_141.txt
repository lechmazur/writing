<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the submarine-engineer-poet juxtaposition feels fresh, the framing of “women’s wisdom” risks reductive essentialism; the ending subverts escapism tropes effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements converge into a thematically tight, resonant whole—only the scavenger hunt setup feels tacked on; the story’s brevity enhances its mythic compactness.</comment>
