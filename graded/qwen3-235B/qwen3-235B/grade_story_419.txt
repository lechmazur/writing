<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths lie in the blacksmith’s empathetic actions aligning with her motivation, but lacks deeper exploration of her personal history; the “no-nonsense” trait occasionally feels overshadowed by poetic introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear throughline from haunting to resolution via the pendant’s creation; pacing is tight but occasionally feels rushed during spectral interactions. Cause-effect logic is consistent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on vivid sensory contrasts—forge heat vs. spectral chill—but the Victorian dollhouse aesthetic occasionally veers toward Gothic cliché without fully exploiting its thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance via themes of memory and connection; subtext about preservation vs. stagnation is present but underdeveloped. Ending feels purposeful but slightly formulaic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes (e.g., ghosts aren’t malevolent) but leans on familiar imagery (dust, shattered glass). Language is lyrical yet occasionally overwrought, straining toward profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements contribute meaningfully to the narrative; the brevity emphasizes thematic cohesion over plot complexity. Leaves a lingering contemplative mood aligned with its theme.</comment>
