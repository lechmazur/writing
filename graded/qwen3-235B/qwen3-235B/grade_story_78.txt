<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's grief and resolve drive actions, but depth beyond archetypal "hero" traits is underexplored; motivation is clear yet emotionally static.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves completeness in brief span, but key transitions (raiders' compliance) lack narrative groundwork; pacing uneven during pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, unsettling atmosphere through sensory specifics ("crunching solar panels," "shimmer of satellite grid"); setting shapes both conflict and theme with gritty cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("compass needle trembling northward") elevate thematic resonance, but subtext about survival's cost is overshadowed by occasionally portentous prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasional clich√©s ("jagged teeth of Collapse") and overwrought phrasing undercut originality; emotional nuance in grief portrayal avoids formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve story purposefully despite tight length; ending lingers with thematic resonance, but brief format limits deeper exploration of central ideas.</comment>
