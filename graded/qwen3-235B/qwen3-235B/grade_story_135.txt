<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (documenting dialects) drives action, but depth undercut by minimalist prose; loyalty to 'lost words' consistent, but Eira's inner conflict remains underexplored. The metal straw's personal history adds emotional weight, but distinct narrative voice lacks nuance typical of first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence but strains under word limit: map revelation and enclave discovery feel abrupt. Chronological progression from tavern relic to preserved dialects holds logical through-line, yet pivotal moments (e.g., confrontation with elders) lack gestation. The wheel's descendants as endpoint cleverly bookends, but pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting's mechanical caravans and frostbitten dialects create potent atmosphere. Sensory details (pulsing bruises, braille-like accordion dents) anchor the fantastical. However, 'after the wheel' timeframe feels underutilized thematic scaffolding. The harbor's groaning gear-metaphor for linguistic erosion elevates cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (straw as bridge, bruises as constellations) resonate with existential threat to language. The blind accordionist's untranslated song embodies theme powerfully. Ending's wheel descendants juxtaposed with preserved word transcends sentimentality. Some telling ('peculiar faith') undercuts 'showing' mastery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in decoding carnival bruises as map/genealogy of speech. Avoids linguist clich√©s through tactile archaeology (straw/wax tablet transcription). No repetitive phrasing; 'rusted gears' through 'humming gears' progression shows arc. Overly mythic diction ('wheel's descendants') slightly mars precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brewer-to-linguist pivot strains plausibility but works as allegory. Story sacrifices micro-character beats for grand theme. Economy of language serves the haunting tone but limits emotional saturation. The final whisper-'music' over meaning' crystallizes theme with lingering resonance.</comment>
