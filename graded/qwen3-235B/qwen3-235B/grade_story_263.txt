<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with Morvain’s zealotry driving his actions. The plush ties to his backstory, but inner conflict feels underdeveloped despite effective alignment with his traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has a tight arc: setup, execution, aftermath. Pacing is efficient but slightly rushed in mid-action; cause-effect relationships (e.g., echo sabotage leading to trident failure) maintain coherence within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic imagery with bioluminescent coral, twin moons, and eerie kelp forests immerse readers. The plush juxtaposes decay against the reef’s grandeur, though some sensory details (e.g., oceanic soundscape) could deepen.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor ("morality as a current") and symbolic objects elevate the story. The thematic focus on legacy and truth resonates, with a poignant ending that avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids genre tropes—e.g., the plush and "echo-reversal device" feel original. Some phrases lean ornate ("bruise-purple hues"), but the tonal balance of solemnity and dry humor feels distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements serve the story, though the echo device’s mechanics require narrative hand-waving. The brevity feels intentional, emphasizing climax over exposition. Lingering questions about the Drowned King’s history hint at depth.</comment>
