<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is symbolic and vividly rendered, but lacks internal conflict and concrete backstory that would make the prophetic drive more universally relatable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear progression is clear, but the mythical elements create ambiguity about whether this is a literal journey or an allegorical awakening, slightly undermining narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hyper-detailed textures (rust, wood grain, stickers as "wounds") create immersive decay, though steampunk machinery feels underutilized beyond decorative background elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor density (stickers as "peeling youth," train whistle as "ghost's sigh") delivers powerful thematic resonance, with motion-as-activism concept memorably embodied in the skateboard's physicality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vibrant originality in mashing prophetic gravitas with countercultural detritus (anarchist stickers + rusted machines), avoiding clich√© through tactile specificity rather than abstract polemics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements function as poetic metaphors rather than literal plot devices, creating thematic harmony; the train-whistle catalyst feels marginally less essential than other components.</comment>
