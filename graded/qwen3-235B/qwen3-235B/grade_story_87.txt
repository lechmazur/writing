<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but slightly overshadowed by dense prose; inner conflict lacks visceral immediacy despite potent thematic grounding in archival ethics and betrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through physical objects (stickers/tapes) as narrative anchors; pacing stumbles slightly in transitional moments but resolves effectively with haunting final image.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steampunk elements create tactile, immersive decay; sensory details (coal smoke, ruptured pipes) masterfully enhance psychological states and moral rot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (adhesive as regret, incineration as release) resonate powerfully; ending transcends 'hollow victory' clich√© with paradoxical fusion of triumph and existential starvation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional overwrought phrasing (e.g., "Morse code of release"); emotional beats occasionally stated when subtext would strengthen impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interconnect with thematic precision; brevity amplifies psychological tension, though minor character nuance sacrificed for atmospheric density.</comment>
