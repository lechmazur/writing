<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (debt, reversal) are clear but lightly sketched; the gambler's "naivety" and unpredictability drive actions but lack deeper psychological nuance. His bargain with the mold reveals desperation but doesn’t fully explore contradictions between his stated goals and symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear progression from bargain to crisis to resolution, but the turbine reversal feels rushed and under-explained. The structure uses the word limit efficiently but leans too heavily on poetic vagueness in key moments (e.g., "spat the incoming wave back") rather than earned climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (candle wax, rusted metal, turbine thrum) and the juxtaposition of industrial decay with occult rituals create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere. The professors’ ghosts as static and the tidal station’s rhythm enhance the tone of doomed defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (mold as burden, candles as transient hope) and subtext (rebellion vs. surrender). The ending resonates thematically, but some poetic phrases ("bitter sweetener to the wine") border on forced lyricism. Emotional impact is potent yet grounded in imagery, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original combination of elements avoids clichés; themes of energy, debt, and memory are fresh. No AI-like repetition or tonal shifts. The professors’ lectures and candle mold feel purposeful, not derivative. Only minor overuse of adjectives ("wine-thick stories," "mechanical Lazarus") slightly strains credibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements; each component (debt, mold, station, spark) serves the theme of defiance against entropy. The brevity enhances urgency but leaves some emotional beats (engineers’ tears, professors’ legacy) underdeveloped. Lingering questions about "spark" symbolism justify reflection.</comment>
