<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character possesses philosophical weight and unique attributes but lacks deeper emotional complexity; motivation is clear but occasionally abstracted into concept rather than felt experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear escape arc resolves effectively but pacing feels compressed; some transitions between action sequences and thematic musings lack rhythmic balance within the tight word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decayed artificiality rendered through precise sensory contrasts (gold dawn/static gaps), though existential dread occasionally overshadows environmental specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric language and theme of memory-as-resistance elevate the piece, though emotional resolution feels conceptually overdetermined rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking imagery interspersed with overly familiar phrasing about loops and simulations; some emotional beats verge on stated rather than embodied, though tonal consistency remains intact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptually rich premise with thematic cohesion, but element integration varies â€“ certain devices feel thematically essential while others operate as symbolic scaffolding rather than narrative bedrock.</comment>
