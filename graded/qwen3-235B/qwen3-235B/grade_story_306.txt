<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While Lila's ambition and shattered psyche provide surface-level motivation, her descent lacks gradual development, relying on exposition rather than lived tension between her past and present selves. The child-star trauma feels stated over shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot's cathedral-vault structure and Faerie mound climax lack connective tissue—the "vibration to descent to revelation" sequence progresses via dreamlike logic rather than organic causality, undermining tension despite vivid beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich imagery (stained glass as prismatic code, 444 Hz as ritual frequency) creates hallucinatory immediacy, but over-reliance on "mad scientist" clichés (tap-dancing boots?) undermines the cathedral's eerie gravitas.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of sound as synapse-altering force is arresting; Lila's self-annihilation-as-ambition crescendo resonates. However, some poetic overreach (e.g., "cosmic audition") muddies thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends cultish fandom with occult science effectively, but tropes like the collapsing chamber "pyrotechnic farewell" feel contrived rather than subversive. The frequency dials/rose window intersection is fresh, though.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts to weld gothic atmosphere with modern decay of celebrity showcase ambition, but tonal whiplash between Lila's trauma and campy accessories (noise-cancelling headphones?) weakens emotional gravity.</comment>
