<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially developed; the sister's eulogy and father's note are underexplored, but the assassin's duality and use of routine to cope with trauma are effectively layered into actions and setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with clear cause-effect, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions (e.g., widow's betrayal reveal) feeling slightly rushed despite strong central twist and cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (lantern's patina, cemetery mud, ticking clocks) create a suffocating atmosphere of regret and secrecy that amplifies both character and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (time as both creation and destruction) and haunting imagery elevate the narrative, though some subtextual ambiguity in the widow's final agency slightly dilutes thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise with inventive subversion of assassin tropes through symbolism; avoids overwrought prose despite lyrical style, maintaining emotional resonance through precise, context-driven details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion across elements with deliberate brevity; lingering questions about complicity and grief justify the constrained format rather than limiting it.</comment>
