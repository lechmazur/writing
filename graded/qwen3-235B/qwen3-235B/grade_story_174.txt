<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Main character’s artistic obsession and regret are vividly stated but psychologically flat; motivations align with actions yet lack emotional texture – more symbolic conduit than fleshed person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from haunted designer to temporal resolution, but compressed trajectory from frost patterns to time-bending fireworks feels rushed; conceptual logic holds, emotional beats skim surfaces.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of melancholy and frozen wonder achieved through precise tactile details (frost veins, crackling tomes); setting’s mythic undertones clash slightly with modern fireworks framework but mostly coexist beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractals as time, firework symmetry as redemption) resonate intellectually; final line balances hope and ambiguity, though Elara’s spectral response risks melodrama. Lyrical yet controlled prose elevates thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise in theory (temporal botany?), but execution leans on fantasy tropes (hidden library, mentor’s unfinished work) rather than subverting them; language avoids overt purple prose but occasionally drifts into clinical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story weaves elements into a resonant whole despite word constraints, though some connections (fireworks ↔ leaf geometry) demand suspension of disbelief; emotional resonance present but unevenly distributed across narrative layers.</comment>
