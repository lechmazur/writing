<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (proving midnight's impermanence) drives the plot, but the internal logic of their desperation lacks nuanced layering. The shadow-self is symbolic but remains underexplored beyond its narrative function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot tightly follows the scholar's obsession to its resolution, with cause-effect clarity. However, the confrontation with the shadow-self feels condensed, slightly diminishing the emotional weight of the "scattered selves" theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends surreal and tactile details (humming shell, frayed carpets), effectively reinforcing the mystical tone. Flying carpet garage and restroom diaries create tonal dissonance that slightly undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors ("mosaic souls," time as a threshold) deepen thematic resonance. Ending balances closure with mystery, though some imagery risks over-explanation (e.g., "frantic peace").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the witch’s garage setting and soul-mirroring concept, but diary-in-bathroom trope feels overused. Language avoids most purple prose but occasionally relies on familiar rhythms in introspective passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Story coalesces around its mythopoeic themes, balancing brevity with emotional heft. The elements work symbiotically, with the shell’s symbolism and midnight-as-threshold motif creating lingering resonance.</grade>
