<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thaddeus’ theatricality defines his actions, but motivations (revenge vs. redemption) lack psychological depth. Confession to vendor feels abrupt rather than earned through prior emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression via riddles is contrived but serviceable. The connection between kindness acts and puzzle-solving feels overly schematic, flattening cause-and-effect into mechanical steps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive worldbuilding with kinetic sensory details (neon signs, tectonic shifts). The city-as-character thrives; symbiosis between setting and theme elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (theft vs. truth, sincerity vs. power) and lyrical prose shine, but resolution’s thematic payoff feels simplified—complexity teased but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés (kindness as weaponized quest mechanic) but occasionally succumbs to ornate abstraction (“frenzied tranquility”). Subtler emotion-handling would enhance authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a whimsical arc but lack narrative urgency. The ending’s tonal shift feels unearned; the discarded case symbolizes theme but lacks emotional weight.</comment>
