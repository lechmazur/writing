<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (hush the crowd) is clear, but psychological depth lacks; actions align with assigned traits but interiority remains elusive. Assigned attribute "clumsily dexterous" shapes physicality more than psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure emerges within word limit; cause/effect between crowd's roar, Mire's preparations, and projection climax cohere. Pacing occasionally stalls in atmospheric digressions but resolves effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Witch's cauldron imagery merges with technological metaphor seamlessly; sensory details (prayers humming in glass, steam's texture) create oppressive atmosphere. Timeframe device ("chalkboard's hush") anchors the world's internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful use of subtext through projected illusions as collective confession; ending's ambiguity about justice vs. temporary reprieve lingers. Prose achieves poetic precision without overwrought metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subverts crowd-justice tropes through spectral film/silence-as-weapon; avoids AI patterning through tactile specifics (e.g., "edges worn smooth by use"). Occasional rhythmic repetition ("clumsy dexterity") risks sing-song cadence but doesn't derail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve story organically despite high-concept framing; brevity enhances tension. Lingering question about cyclical silence/roar invests narrative with existential weight beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
