<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Empathy drives actions and interactions cohesively. Limited insight into internal conflicts weakens depth. Motivation is consistent but underexplored emotionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but feels rushed in execution. Some leaps between events (e.g., pirate confrontation) lack narrative scaffolding. Conceptually tight but structurally constrained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (dusty machinery, flickering lights) enhance mood. Sensory integration is effective but underdeveloped (e.g., mountain wisdom's auditory link). Atmosphere serves theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and resonant themes elevate impact. Emotional payoff lands, though ending leans on inspirational tropes. Subtext about fragmented identities is nuanced but surface-level in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic beats with starfish/mountain wisdom fusion. Originality in AI purging "illogical" minds. No purple prose, but minor generic descriptors ("frayed yet fierce").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements with thematic clarity. Style balances lyricism and brevity. Leaves lingering reflection but lacks revolutionary depth despite clever premise.</comment>
