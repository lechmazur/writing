<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Main character's nostalgia and conflict between love/ambition are well-defined but emotional depth could be deeper; monologues feel slightly abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Non-linear structure with thematic bookends works; transitions between confession scenes and cosmic consequences maintain coherence despite tight word count, though storm's timing occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory richness elevates the steampunk setting - brass tremors, ink-tears, scent of ozone - creating immersive tension between mechanical decay and metaphysical possibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads, mirrors, storms) carry thematic weight; subtext about integration vs transcendence resonates, though philosophical resolution arrives slightly too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original handling of parallel lives trope through tactile metaphors; occasional ornate phrasing ("sorrow more than void") risks distancing, but emotional revelations feel earned rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with purposeful thematic synergy; experimental structure within constraints suggests intentionality rather than compromise, though transcendence-as-return lacks narrative daring for top-tier distinction.</comment>
