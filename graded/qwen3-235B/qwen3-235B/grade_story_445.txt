<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's weariness and past influence actions, but inner conflict lacks depth; motivations hinted but not fully embodied through nuanced behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically between wandering, discovery, and epiphany, but the mist lifting feels contrived; some pacing inconsistencies undercut tightness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere weakens in dissonant elements (disguise room's purpose unclear); sensory details inconsistent in grounding fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linguistic flourishes occasionally border on purple prose; avoids major tropes but relies on slightly abstract phrasing over concrete emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve theme, but brevity constrains deeper exploration; leaves lingering questions rather than profound resonance.</comment>
