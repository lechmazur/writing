<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (atonement) is clear and drives action, but inner conflict remains underexplored; "ghostly resolve" is stated rather than embodied through nuanced behavior; minimal dialogue weakens distinct voice development</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying cause-effect (chain alters destiny) and circular structure, but compressed execution creates ambiguity about how tracing stars physically changes fate; pacing uneven in midsection transitions</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meticulously rendered atmosphere with tactile celestial details (pitted meteorite, breathing shadows) creates immersive liminality; time suspension enhances thematic tension between permanence and change</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical web (chain as temporal key, dirges undone) and haunting imagery elevate narrative; emotional resonance slightly undercut by overreliance on poetic abstraction over visceral character experience</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through synesthetic fusion of science/poetry; some phrases ("bones still hear") risk pretension, but originality shines in treating "quiet" as active force rather than absence</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into metaphysical thriller despite brevity; themes of redemption through microscopic intervention emerge strongly, though sheriff's transformation lacks granular depiction</comment>
