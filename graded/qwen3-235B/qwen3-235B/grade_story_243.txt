<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character exhibits nervous habits but lacks internal depth; motivation hinges on exposition rather than intrinsic drive; reaction to divine visions shows fear but doesn't fully explore necromancer's psyche or unique voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear descent mirrors glitch narrative; cause-effect between sound patterns and spatial unlocking is clever; pacing manages complexity within constraints despite slightly rushed divine awakening resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Retro-video-game atmosphere meticulously rendered through pixelated air, polygonal shards, and 8-bit static; sensory fusion of glowing barbs and humming code strengthens mood; slumbering gods enhance temporal tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "temporal loop" and mutable footsteps offer thematic resonance; ending's ambiguity raises questions about truth's cost but insufficient emotional anchoring hinders deeper impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subverts savior trope with warden revelation; avoids clich√© through genre-blending; precise sensory details (spectral carp, neon drips) enhance originality; no excessive formality or predictable emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve theme rather than vice versa; brevity amplifies existential stakes; recursive animation twist and cyclical mural imagery demonstrate purposeful concision with lingering thematic weight.</comment>
