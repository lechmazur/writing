<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak secondary characters; protagonist's internal conflict lacks emotional depth despite clear motivations. Wanderer’s role as a plot device overshadows personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression undermined by abrupt shifts in time and spirit manifestation mechanics; resolution achieved too neatly for the established mystical complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent sensory details (charred beans, volcanic glass) create a vivid, immersive setting; occasional overdetermination with excessive mystical accoutrements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance with reinvention vs. tradition; emotional impact diluted by overly expository dialogue ("Our blood remembers") and uneven pacing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of tattooing and magic; avoids clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate description (e.g., "midnight lotus ink") that prioritizes style over coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion strained by sheer number of elements; brevity works against development of the lost city subplot and deeper exploration of the rebel-keeper duality.</comment>
