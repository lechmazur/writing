<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's reservation is evident through solitude and quiet determination, but lacks depth beyond action. Motivation to preserve art is consistent but emotional complexity is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is driven by the act of mending, but pacing feels uneven in places. Clear arc from isolation to revival, though some cause-effect connections could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imaginative setting but atmospheric details could be more vivid. Sensory contrasts (lab vs. choir) enhance mood but lack full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance through subtext and symbolism; ending ties theme to action. Literary devices (metaphor, imagery) enrich narrative, though some subtleties could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with clear theme. Style serves purpose but occasionally strains under ornate description. Leaves a lingering impression of cultural preservation and hope.</comment>
