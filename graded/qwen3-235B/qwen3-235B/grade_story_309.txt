<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Complex portrait of a haunted detective through tactile details, but motivation remains abstractly tied to trauma rather than concrete character-defining priorities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightly-wound structure uses the 500 words like a compressed spring, though the ending's metaphysical leanings risk diluting the noir grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting with tactile decay - warped mirrors and bleeding paintings create a character in themselves, though timeframe integration feels decorative rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope as memory prism is masterstroke; weaves trauma into narrative structure. Ending's "dance" with nihilism feels simultaneously fresh and familiar.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps through poetic grit ("molten sarcasm"), but some phrases border on noir parody ("match hissing like confession"). Memories-as-liars concept elevates the human elements.</comment>
