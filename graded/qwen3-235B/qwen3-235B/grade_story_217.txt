<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>June’s "underestimated rebel" label lacks full integration; her actions stem more from grief than rebellion. Motivations tied to familial loss are clear, but the political/social edge implied by "rebel" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong central action (rescuing her brother) drives coherence, but some plot mechanics (e.g., spectral traps) feel perfunctory. The emotional arc concludes satisfactorily, though pacing occasionally sacrifices tension for poetic brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, multisensory integration of setting elements—sesame oil-slicked carousel, chili-laced ghosts—creates an atmosphere where culinary nostalgia and horror collide, heightening emotional stakes through environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elevated prose blends mythic resonance with emotional authenticity. Recipes as incantations and memory-as-cuisine deepen thematic layers. Ending avoids neat resolution, favoring bittersweet, thought-provoking ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subverts horror tropes via Korean diasporic lens; metaphors (e.g., congealed gochujang as emotional paralysis) feel fresh. Occasional rhythmic stiffness and overly elaborate phrasing hint at formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully woven into narrative without feeling forced. Despite formal constraints, story maintains conceptual cohesion and thematic richness, though brevity occasionally curtails deeper exploration of psychological nuance.</comment>
