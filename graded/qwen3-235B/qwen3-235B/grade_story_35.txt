<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's passivity weakens motivation; emotional shift feels under-explored despite lyrical hints at trauma. Nuanced backstory is implied but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on transformative object-driven moment rather than organic progression; circular structure works within constraints but pivotal actions (joining retreat) feel under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (jasmine roots, humming air) that ground mystical elements; tonal consistency between silence and longing creates immersive dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate powerfully (roots/grief, silence-as-translation); ending achieves poetic symmetry without overstating themes; emotional layers emerge through gesture rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids formula through specific, culturally textured details (cobalt sari, missionary backstory); magical realism feels organic, not gimmicked; prose balances precision with lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with thematic intent rather than checklist; brevity enhances elegiac tone; lingering resonance emerges from juxtaposition of natural cycles and human emotional archaeology.</comment>
