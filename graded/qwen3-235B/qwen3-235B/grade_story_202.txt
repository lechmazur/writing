<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's guilt and precision are consistent, but motivations lack depth; the scavenger hunt as penance feels underexplored. The "innocently guilty" duality is clever but thinly developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through cryptic clues, but the resolution ("forgiven") feels abrupt. The scavenger hunt structure is cohesive, though the leap from guilt to forgiveness lacks narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (dusty starlight, rattling skateboards) immerse readers. The museum's atmosphere perfectly complements the tone of haunted precision and fragile balance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("cobalt liquid etching 'forgiven'") and subtext about guilt/balance resonate. Ending feels earned, but emotional impact is slightly muted by overly abstract phrasing in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., compass toward "heart's tremor") avoid cliche, though some phrases ("gravityâ€™s edge softened") border on purple prose. Emotional nuance feels genuine, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully integrated; the concise format enhances tension. The final revelation lingers, though the thematic weight of "gravity" and "balance" could be more explicit.</comment>
