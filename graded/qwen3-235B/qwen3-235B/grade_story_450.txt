<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's sharp wit is present but underutilized beyond dialogue; her dancer identity feels superficially integrated, as plot hinges more on familial legacy. Motivation to defy denial is clear, but reactions lack emotional nuance beyond stated defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through uncovering the patch's secret, but pacing accelerates abruptly in the climax, sacrificing depth. The beginning-to-end arc is coherent but feels slightly rushed within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., steam blurring photos, bubbles clinging to ears) and the claustrophobic chamber create a dense, oppressive atmosphere. Tone effectively contrasts familial denial with stark truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery (ashes as galaxies) and metaphor (denial as pressure) are potent. The theme of inherited lies and the subversive ending provoke reflection, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by explicit thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining sci-fi with intimate family drama. Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers toward ornate prose ("screams of a dying starship"). Nuanced emotional beats are implied but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole; the twist on the prophecy elevates the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, though some threads (e.g., dancer motif) could deepen for greater impact.</comment>
