<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character transformation is vivid through dialogue and poetic exchange, but lacks psychological depth; motivation to challenge insignificance is clear but inconsistently embodied in actions beyond dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from theft to self-discovery, but pivotal moments (dummy's moth-spilling, sudden transformation) feel disjointed; pacing falters in balancing symbolic beats within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie lighthouse setting is richly textured but inconsistently utilized; sensory details (steam-turned-stanzas, cracked dummy) create immersive tone, yet the timeframe's "appointments" remain vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("spectral stanzas") and thematic resonance of transformation elevate impact, but over-reliance on poetic abstraction dilutes emotional immediacy; ending lacks follow-through on thematic promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on Gothic tropes with uneven subversion; some phrases ("scorching poise") risk pretension; character nuance is implied through action but diluted by lyrical overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story succeeds in weaving assigned elements into a thematically unified whole, but stylistic excesses and uneven pacing limit its punch; conceptually clever but occasionally sacrifices cohesion for poetic flourish.</comment>
