<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct with nuanced inner conflicts (craving real vs digital), but motivation to find connection lacks deeper exploration of how her personal history intersects with the estate. The cameo revelation is poignant but arrives too late to fully reframe her earlier actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains strong causal throughlines (artifact discovery → supernatural events → resolution) within tight constraints, though the leap to the cameo’s supernatural power feels under-explained. Pacing falters slightly in the poltergeist section, which loses momentum despite atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Masterful layering of sensory contrasts (lavender/mildew, marble crunch vs digital screens) and temporal juxtapositions (QR codes on frescoes). Atmosphere deepens both theme and character motive, though overgrown villa could use one more visceral detail to anchor it fully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional emotional resonance through "listening" as a metaphor; symbols like the cameo and sewing box work as dual leitmotifs. Ending avoids sentimentality while delivering emotional payoff. Theme of inherited secrecy and digital alienation is richly subtextual and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls—sharp phrases like "shadows pooling like ink" avoid cliche, and the fusion of eras feels intentional. Some mild purple prose in "whispers coiling" distracts, but the narrative voice remains consistent and purposeful with minimal redundancies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>All elements cohere into a unified exploration of legacy and digitization. The brevity amplifies emotional urgency. Lingers in the mind not just for its plot, but for its interrogation of how modernity interacts with the past—original, layered, and thematically resonant.</comment>
