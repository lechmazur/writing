<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No discernible agency or inner conflict; motivations are abstractly metaphysical rather than emotionally grounded. Character voice dissolves under scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured structure relies on poetic associations over cause-effect logic; coherence maintained through recurring symbols but lacks traditional narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imaginative synthesis of digital/mystical elements sustains intrigue despite thematic opacity; formal experimentation justifies brevity while sacrificing emotional weight.</comment>
