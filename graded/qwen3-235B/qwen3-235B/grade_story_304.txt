<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivations are poetically stated but opaque; actions align with abstract theme but lack psychological depth. Dialogue reveals a pivotal moment of self-doubt, but internal consistency feels secondary to atmospheric demands.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pacing is elegant but plot coherence falters—driver's disappearance and assassin's emotional arc feel abrupt. Connection between beginning and end hinges on thematic resonance rather than causal logic. The assigned action drives minimal events efficiently but avoids concrete resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vividly realized through obsessive sensory detail; the baroque asteroid's decayed grandeur and synthetic atmosphere amplify the existential tone. Setting is character and antagonist, shaping every interaction. Spiderwebs and starlight create a haunting, unified visual logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (shattered lens, unforgiving road) echo with philosophical weight. Ending subverts violence with emotional ambiguity, leaving lingering questions about agency. Style occasionally overindulges in adjectival density but generally enhances mood. Central theme of erasure vs. remembrance emerges powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some phrasing ("lurking assassin," "unforgiving road") risks cliché but gains freshness through context. Avoids formula in tone and resolution; emotional nuance shows humanity beneath the ornate prose. Moments of vagueness ("trembling hands") detract from otherwise specific imagery, but overall the voice feels authorial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements serve a cohesive artistic vision but occasionally strain credibility (e.g., camera lens as narrative device). Length feels intentional, with compression highlighting existential brevity. Lingering effect arises from poetic density rather than narrative momentum.</comment>
