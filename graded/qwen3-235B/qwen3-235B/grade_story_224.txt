<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (escape from mundane existence through silence) are clear and consistent with traits, though deeper exploration of the minstrel's psyche would strengthen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The meteorite rejuvenation method feels conceptually disjointed from the plot's emotional core, while the rushed ascension lacks visceral consequence within tight word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rush-hour giant dining room atmosphere vividly contrasts with cosmic ascension through precise sensory contrasts (ozone, stardust, clattering plates) that deepen the thematic tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors of silence-as-home and texture-as-memory create layered subtext; the ending achieves thematic resonance without over-explaining, using imagery to evoke transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy tropes by focusing on sensory specificity (meteorite grain humming in bone) rather than predictable hero's journey arcs, though some poetic passages risk veering into ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>All assigned elements are present and thematically connected, though the meteorite texture method feels strained; the brief length serves the mythic tone but sacrifices emotional weight in key transitions.</comment>
