<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional interiority despite poetic gestures; motivations inferred through abstract symbolism rather than concrete psychological logic, creating an intellectual rather than visceral connection to their rebellion against conformity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear ascent/return structure provides scaffolding but tension dissipates between metaphysical questions and material actions; resolution feels more like thematic repetition than earned conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vividly oppressive urban texture merges with cosmic abstraction through precise details (synth-coffee, streaked glass), but emotional geography remains diffuse – the city’s “hush” lacks tactile immediacy beyond metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphysical themes resonate through prismatic imagery and recursive motifs; however, some lyrical abstractions (“folklore of cracks”) risk collapsing into vague idealism rather than grounded philosophical inquiry.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evades formulaicity through paradoxical language (“absurd solemnity”) and subverted archetypes; occasional phrases (“nebula’s frozen gases”) verge on overworked beauty but mostly sustain inventive estrangement from cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but strain emotional engagement; brevity serves conceptual scaffolding yet leaves mythic layering unsatisfied, like half-unspooled parable demanding extension beyond tight structure.</comment>
