<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear temporal structure creates satisfying thematic symmetry but feels slightly rushed; pivotal transitions between past/present/future lack full emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hyper-detailed cybernetic decay evokes vivid atmosphere, though some sensory elements prioritize aesthetic over narrative functionality; holographic fireflies and server-vines lack clear symbolic purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High-concept fusion of elements succeeds thematically but sacrifices narrative intimacy; technical precision occasionally overshadows human-scale emotional engagement.</comment>
