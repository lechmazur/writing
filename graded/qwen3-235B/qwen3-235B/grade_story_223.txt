<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Secret trade overshadows seasickness; motivation driven by guilt rather than naval identity. Emotional confession feels earned but physical ailment remains surface-level trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight arc from bulb burial to mirror confrontation. Pacing within the word limit falters slightly during canyon entry but maintains cause-effect clarity through moon-phase dependency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prismatic cliffs and glassy soil create immersive sensory worlds. Atmospheric resonance between canyon and fortress underscores thematic truth-seeking but occasionally leans on visual spectacle over emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirrors as unspoken selves) and symbolic transformations deliver emotional resonance. Ending avoids melodrama, but slight over-reliance on "pulse" and "tremble" weakens final line's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy tropes through paradoxical "cure/requiem" framing. Emotional nuance in brother's visage reveals rather than states grief, though journal confessions risk implying narrative convenience over psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic depth (orchid as transaction, mirrors as reckoning). Narrative compression works but occasionally strains time-sense (centuries vs. immediate journey). Leaves haunting ambiguity about release vs. resignation.</comment>
