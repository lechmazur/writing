<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (rebellion, shame) is clear and consistent, but emotional depth feels surface-level despite thematic resonance. Actions align with traits but lack layered nuance; "voice" is strong stylistically but risks overshadowing human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from creation to climax, with the bell's activation driving narrative momentum. However, the ending's abstract resolution feels abrupt; the concise word limit creates tension between expansive themes and a fully realized arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and immersive (neon orchard, cyberpunk decay), but the timeframe (radio broadcast) is underutilized. Sensory details (bioluminescent boughs, spores on the wind) enhance mood, though deeper integration of the "passionate subtlety" tone would strengthen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Successfully evokes emotional resonance through metaphor (DNA as rebellion, shame as architecture). Literary devices (fractals, syntax-as-sound) elevate the narrative. Ending balances closure with haunting ambiguity, though some abstractions dilute thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in blending bio-tech poetics with psychological themes. Avoids clich√©s (DNA-encoded language, living orchard), but occasional ornate phrasing ("neon sap rising in symbiotic rhythm") edges toward purple prose. Emotions are shown through symbolism but sometimes generalized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gels cohesive narrative from high-concept elements, though thematic density occasionally overwhelms pacing. Creativity in combining cyberpunk, biology, and exile motifs shines, but tighter balance between lyrical abstraction and grounded emotional beats would elevate impact.</comment>
