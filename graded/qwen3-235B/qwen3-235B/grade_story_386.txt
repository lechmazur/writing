<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Minimal insight into internal conflicts; motivations are clear but rooted more in symbolic purpose than human depth. Consistently aligned with actions but lacks emotional dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Logical progression from setup to action, but resolution feels abrupt. The catapult climax is strong, but causal connections between the tablecloth’s ignition and the scar’s narrowing are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eerie, vivid atmosphere crafted through precise details (salt plains, ozone scent) and temporal instability. The lighthouse and scar anchor the setting’s tone and thematic resonance. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, potent metaphors ("bridge," "threads of will"), and layered themes of memory/resilience. The ending’s epiphany delivers emotional weight but risks didacticism. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and myth, though some descriptions risk ornate abstraction. Avoids genre clichés but occasionally prioritizes poeticism over narrative clarity. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a resonant whole despite brevity. The themes of rebuilding and defiance linger, though character nuance and a rushed epiphany slightly dilute impact. </comment>
