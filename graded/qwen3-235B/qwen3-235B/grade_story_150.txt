<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s peculiarity drives plot but lacks emotional depth; motivation to disrupt is clear but underexplored, voice distinctive yet thinly contextualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot’s trajectory (rewrite vs. industrialists) coherent and purposeful; pacing tight but resolution abrupt, causality logical within fantastical framework despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting’s steampunk visuals vivid but unevenly sensory; atmospheric tone aligns with thematic tension, though tactile/olfactory details sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like “clockwork sun” deepen themes; ending resonates as thematic closure; subtext critiques power through art, but dialogue sparse, “showing” over “telling” uneven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery fresh in parts (“misalign fate”) but tropes (shadowy deals) risk cliche; avoids most purple prose but occasionally overadorned; subversion of rebellion trope is clever but uneven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but unevenly; length feels deliberate yet rushed; thematic ambition evident but execution uneven in balancing spectacle and introspection.</comment>
