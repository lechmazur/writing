<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (memory redemption, candle's symbolic persistence) is clear but underdeveloped; his "edginess" remains vague despite metaphorical language, lacking visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on abstract concepts (memory vectorization) rather than concrete cause-effect; circular structure works but pacing falters during abstract transitions between physical and temporal spaces.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile, original sensory details (bioluminescent spores, creaking void) but setting occasionally overshadows narrative purpose; mushroom house's "pessimistic rhythm" deepens rather than distracts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (candle, flyer fragment) elevates thematic impact; lyrical prose sometimes borders on self-indulgent ("void's cold fingers"), weakening emotional immediacy despite evocative subtext about hope's fragility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines via fusion of steampunk-esque mechanics and metaphysical themes; avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally relies on overwrought metaphors ("prismatic candle shards") rather than distilled precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through recurring motifs despite experimental structure; brevity serves atmospheric depth but shortchanges character interiority; ends with resonant ambiguity rather than artificial resolution.</comment>
