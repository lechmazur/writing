<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Limited internal conflict weakens psychological depth; motivations are clear but lack nuanced evolution matching "honestly strange" complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc is complete but rushed – the ascending sequence lacks tension calibration; method's plausibility strained by rapid resolution of core system sabotage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exquisite decay details (smell of flaking posters, metallic taste of recycled air) create haunting atmosphere; object-setting symbiosis occasionally overstated (churn's repeated symbolic mentions).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thematic layers (myth vs. machinery, agrarian past vs. synthetic present) resonate through precise metaphors; "aloof passion" paradox masterfully embodied, though emotional restraint risks distancing readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with butter churn innovation; some near-lapses into cyberpunk tropes ("hydroponic farms") narrowly subverted by mytho-poetic register; vocabulary precise but occasionally mannered ("station's newfound breath").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Purposeful fragmentation enhances brevity's power; conceptual density occasionally overwhelms narrative flow (poster symbolism overload), but thematic unity prevails.</comment>
