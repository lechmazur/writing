<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic by design, but lacks psychological depth or emotional evolution despite poetic framing. Motivation is conceptually consistent but feels archetypal rather than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc with atmospheric cohesion, but the word limit forces abrupt transitions between key moments. Pacing falters slightly during the rift collapse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (shifting mosaics, ash-dissolving photographs) immerse readers in a mythic space. Atmosphere outshines plot as the story’s strongest pillar.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("bridge of light," "lexicon of endings") layer abstract meaning, but subtext about choice vs. contradiction lacks visceral human stakes beneath the allegory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but the line between poetic ambiguity and intentional vagueness wavers. Some phrases ("gravitational sigh") flirt with overwrought abstraction without crossing into incoherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively, but the short form exposes structural seams. The story’s ambition exceeds its capacity to resolve them seamlessly within 500 words.</comment>
