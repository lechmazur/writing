<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Verdant's transformation from apathy to purpose feels conceptually sound but lacks visceral emotional depth; motivations are abstract rather than grounded in relatable plant-specific logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but relies heavily on poetic abstraction over narrative momentum; the drive-in's revelations feel rushed despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering—from "burnt celluloid" scent to "phantom glow" of the screen—immerses readers in a hauntingly specific, emotionally resonant liminal space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor ("archives of what humanity failed to say") elevates the theme; the ending sacrifices resolution for lyrical abstraction but maintains emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through original metaphors (e.g., constellations as "threadbare fabric"), though occasional overreliance on lush description strains narrative clarity and pacing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively interwoven but unevenly weighted—some (drive-in's secrets) shine while others (typewriter's silence) feel underexploited; the vignette format suits its reflective tone.</comment>
