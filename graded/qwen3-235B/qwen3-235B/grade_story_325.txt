<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Botanist’s madness and obsession drive some actions, but motivations remain cryptic. Keeper’s warning lacks emotional depth, though dialogue’s terseness suits the eerie tone. Clive’s personification is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses via the botanist’s interaction with film and belt, but pacing stumbles: intermission’s role feels rushed, and the climax’s abruptness undercuts tension. Cause-effect logic (e.g., pollen’s effect on the film) is opaque.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-altitude tea house evokes vivid unease through tactile details (cracked porcelain, pollen-stung air). The black-and-white film’s static enhances the spectral atmosphere. Relationships between objects (belt, reel) and setting are cleverly, if sparsely, interwoven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery (sentient plants, bleeding intermissions) creates lingering unease. Subtext around obsession and betrayal emerges through layered dialogue. Ending’s ambiguity amplifies thematic resonance. Dialogue sparing yet cutting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in merging botany with spectral cartography, but some phrases (“madness born from truth”) veer toward cliché. Metaphors like “veins opening to the half-remembered” stand out; minimal purple prose, though the keeper’s dialogue borders on cryptic contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements like the film’s hidden doorway and ionized belt feel intricately intertwined with the plot. The brevity sharpens the mystery, though some plot beats (e.g., the key’s sudden appearance) strain plausibility.</comment>
