<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While characters have distinct voices, their motivations (minstrel's cosmic obsession, Lira's vendetta) feel underexplored; the feud's resolution is abrupt rather than earned through layered interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but progression relies heavily on thematic shifts rather than organic plot mechanics; the cloud-pattern tracking as method lacks full integration with narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Compelling sensory collisions (synthetic hay vs. ozone) create a vivid but partially realized world; the rooftop stables/metropolis juxtaposition hints at deeper worldbuilding never fully explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (phoenix stamp, spiral clouds) elevate thematic resonance; the mundane coffee truce against cosmic silence creates satisfying emotional contrast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through tonal paradoxes (e.g., "mundane enchantment"), but some descriptors ("neon-lit abyss") border on familiar speculative tropes rather than strikingly original imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under symbolic weight (rubber stamp revelation feels slightly schematic); brevity sacrifices deeper character exploration for conceptual neatness.</comment>
