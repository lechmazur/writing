<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's wistful arrogance is consistently portrayed through his artistry and detachment, but lacks complexity beyond archetypal 'rebel loner' tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight pacing and cyclical structure anchor the story, but the abrupt arc conclusion leaves the central conflict's consequences underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visceral, cohesive atmosphere blends cyberpunk grime with haunting organic imagery; dust motes and neon create haunting contrast, though some descriptors verge on overload.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Masterful weaving of assigned elements into a haunting, unified narrative where form and theme align seamlessly, though brevity slightly limits emotional excavation.</comment>
