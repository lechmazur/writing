<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation (shackled potential + familial legacy) is tightly woven into every action and internal conflict. The arrogant swordsman’s voice carries ironic self-awareness, his doubtfully confident facade crumbling through layered reactions to tangible history. The refusal to sing until forced creates poignant tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Circular logic anchors the plot: authoritarian authorization leads to submission, singing, and self-liberation. The tapestry’s dissolution as plot mechanism feels slightly too convenient, but the between-breaths timeframe creates urgency that salvages its speed. Cause-effect chain is mostly lucid but strains briefly in the final transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Calligraphy master’s courtyard establishes visual austerity but underutilizes sensory details beyond grainy fabric and cold light. Faded tapestry’s visceral resistance (threads clinging “like clasped hands”) brilliantly merges tactile and emotional texture. Atmosphere supports theme but lacks environmental specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Splintered melody as metaphor for fractured identity achieves poetic resonance. Contrast between “cold luminescence” and traditional fire imagery subverts fantasy tropes. The ending’s dual role as requiem/lullaby encapsulates theme with haunting clarity. Overreliance on adjectives like “harsh tenderness” slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Resists genre predictability by making song—not sword—the transformative force, but wedding song specificity feels arbitrarily chosen rather than mythologically earned. Arrogance-to-humility arc follows familiar redemption patterns. Language occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction (“thread stitching past to future”) that strains at profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock with deliberate symbolic economy: fading tapestry mirrors stunted blade; master’s silent authority contrasts swordsman’s bark. Story’s brevity enhances mythic compression, though atmospheric corners feel underlit. Lingering question—how this “first flame” will be used—suggests narrative ambition beyond the frame.</comment>
