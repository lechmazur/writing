<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional depth feels surface-level; detachment and love remain underexplored tensions. The vow provides purpose but lacks visceral emotional grounding beyond metaphorical statements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work efficiently within constraints, but the confrontation/catharsis with weavers feels abrupt; rapid resolution through light/shard interaction lacks structural build-up despite clever conceptual linking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion; every setting detail (burnt ozone, holographic decay, molten glass) amplifies thematic paradoxes of memory/recycling while creating palpable atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (phoenix, collage, pottery) elevates narrative; emotional resonance is intellectualized rather than viscerally felt, weakening payoff slightly despite strong thematic unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original mythology elements avoid genre tropes, but some phrases ("whispering glaze", "liquid stars") cross into borderline-purple-prose territory; overall maintains distinctive voice despite occasional flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements synthesized into cohesive whole with thematic purpose; certain mechanical connections (shard hologram triggering map) feel slightly schematic but overall demonstrates masterful integration of constraints.</comment>
