<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character depth exists but motivations lack full human nuance; the prophet’s internal conflict drives the plot but feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing stumbles slightly during the transition from marble assembly to cosmic collapse, rushing the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pervasive lunar imagery and sensory details (methane flares, dust, fogged helmets) create a palpable atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist’s existential struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (scoreboard, keys) are innovative and thematic layers resonate, though one or two lyrical passages risk overshadowing narrative urgency with ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept and execution, though the "final oath" and "rummage sale" elements border on contrived; overall fresh but not entirely free of thematic overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven with thematic cohesion, but some abstract connections (e.g., "defragmentation" as method) slightly dilute narrative clarity; ending lingers effectively.</comment>
