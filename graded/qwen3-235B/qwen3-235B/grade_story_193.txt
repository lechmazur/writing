<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is implied but lacks depth; his transformation hinges on exposition ("he realized") rather than dramatized evolution. The mother's face and letters hint at backstory but remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arch but feels compressed; the mortar's revelation resolves too neatly. Pacing balances action and reflection unevenly—exposition interrupts momentum during key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with sensory details (dust motes, obsidian mortar's pulse) enhancing thematic resonance. Cold-to-warmth shift mirrors emotional progression, grounding ethereal concepts in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (truth-grinding mortar, "alchemy of redemptions") provoke thought, but some lines ("footprints in meltwater") lean on familiar imagery. Ending's thematic clarity compensates for occasional abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some phrases ("scorned lover," "fragile clarity") border on overused lyricism, and the redemption arc risks trope repetition. However, the mortar's psychological symbolism avoids cliche, offering a fresh lens for self-reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under their own weight—unseen forces and "unintentionally iconic" labels feel imposed rather than organic. The brevity works for mythic tone but limits character and conflict complexity.</comment>
