<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character's motivation to confront past regrets is clear but underdeveloped; his actions align logically but lack psychological nuance beyond surface-level regret and resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses cohesively through surreal imagery, but the abrupt transition from despair to renewal feels under-earned despite the tight structure; the photos drive the narrative but lack contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, otherworldly details like dark matter and event-horizon seaweed create atmosphere, but the diner’s abstract setting occasionally undermines emotional immediacy; sensory details are purposeful but unevenly weighted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., photos as mirrors of possibility) and thematic consistency about renewal; prose is lyrical but occasionally prioritizes style over emotional resonance, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original metaphysical concepts subvert genre tropes, but the stranger’s dialogue risks feeling like a didactic monologue; symbolism is rich but occasionally overt, bordering on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a condensed parable with lingering existential questions, though its ambition to blend introspection and surrealism feels slightly constrained by brevity; cohesion is strong despite minor tonal inconsistencies.</comment>
