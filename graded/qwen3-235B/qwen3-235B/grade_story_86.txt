<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's apprehension contrasts with her "usually exceptional" skill but lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than embodied through nuanced choices or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but pacing feels rushed - sentinels and resolution occur without adequate dramatic buildup; "half-used candle" return in climax strains plausibility within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere shines with neon-soaked decay and tactile details (ozone tang, etched floors) though cyberpunk clich√©s occasionally dilute originality despite strong sensory integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ending resonates thematically with "cycle" imagery; metaphors like "false narratives as serpents" elevate the prose, but emotional payoff feels slightly undercut by underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some purple prose ("candle's light stretched thin across centuries") and AI-esque tropes (sentient serpentine data-streams) present, but candle-as-relic motif and timeline-bones offer fresh conceptual fusion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as tightly-woven mosaic of cyberpunk existentialism with lingering philosophical questions about truth's fragility; element integration occasionally strains under density.</comment>
