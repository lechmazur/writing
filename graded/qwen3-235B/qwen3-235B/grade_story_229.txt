<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (impossible promise) drives the narrative but lacks depth beyond resolve; reactions to objects like the ring box reveal curiosity and persistence, but interiority remains opaque, undermining emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear plot leverages tight word limits effectively, using fragmented revelations to mirror thematic dissonance; pacing is tight despite compressed arc, though final act's sudden ship resurrection feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting as a liminal space between decay and rebirth is masterfully rendered through tactile details: salt-crusted planks, weeping pearls, and resonant vibrations; atmospheric cohesion is flawless, enhancing both mystery and thematic disintegration/reconstruction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layering (rain as cipher, ashes as goodbye) elevates beyond fantastical surface; ending's philosophical heft—truth in unraveling—resonates through juxtaposing entropy with purposeful dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls; imagery is fresh but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction (e.g., "universe tucked away its secret"); emotional beats are shown through action but lack raw human complexity beneath poetic veneer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole despite contrivance in certain transitions; brevity serves the story's cryptic elegance, leaving haunting questions about memory's permeability.</comment>
