<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to preserving hunting methods is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance; Elias's jaded nature is consistent, but inner conflict is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a strong arc, but the sudden shift from rooftop climb to throne interaction feels rushed despite effective pacing in the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery of colonial rooftops and labyrinth orchard is vivid, but connections between tactile details (e.g., glove texture, ivy’s grip) could be more visceral to deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through inventive combinations (e.g., locksmiths safeguarding history, throne-as-root); only occasional overdescription threatens to become purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into theme and setting, though the brevity occasionally sacrifices deeper exploration of conflicts beyond the central preservation vs. erasure dichotomy.</comment>
