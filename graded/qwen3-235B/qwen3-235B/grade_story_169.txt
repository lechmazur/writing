<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Soul-broker’s motivation (forgotten songs) is clear and tied to actions, but lacks depth beyond symbolic role; distinct voice balances between poetic and underdeveloped psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Circular plot works within constraints: opening/closing on the platform, single interaction driving resolution; pacing is deliberate but slightly compressed climax risks emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meticulous sensory details (creaking wood, dissolving ink) and surreal logic (tea-fueled bureaucracy) create immersive, haunting atmosphere; every element reinforces tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Layered literary devices (metaphor, inversion, circular structure) amplify theme of memory/release; ending lingers with philosophical weight; subtext on transactional empathy executed implicitly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original fusion of speculative elements avoids cliché; metaphors fresh, prose lyrical but precise; avoids predictability by reframing “broker” archetypes into existential negotiation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements (bottle, platform, reversed labels) are interdependent and conceptually driven; style enhances thematic cohesion; brevity feels purposeful, leaving haunting resonance.</comment>
