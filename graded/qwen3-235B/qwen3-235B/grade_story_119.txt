<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (compassion vs. survival) is clear but lacks emotional complexity; Mara's astral projection skill is underutilized except as a plot device; reactions to the key and decision to save the boy reveal theme but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot urgency propels the story but relies on contrived mechanisms (lever freeing the car feels unearned); cause/effect between astral senses and action is unclear; pacing works for tension but resolution feels abrupt despite tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere succeeds through sensory details (fractured mirror teeth, vibrating key) but setting's symbolic potential (abandoned carnival's history) remains untapped; predators' connection to astral/light duality needs stronger rooting in place.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (compassion as compass/muscle, light as weapon) deepen theme; ending ties to concept effectively but risks preachiness; tension between survival and sacrifice resonates, though interiority remains minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise combines astral horror and cosmic light motifs inventively but occasionally lapses into ornate description ("shattered glass breath," "forgotten hymns"); some character psychology feels overdetermined rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements (key, shadows, coaster) are cleverly integrated but thematic consistency falters (creed of compassion feels artificially imposed rather than organically dramatized); concision mostly serves the story's momentum.</comment>
