<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to transform fear into courage is clear, but the foster father's influence could be more deeply integrated into present actions; the aloofness sometimes obscures emotional connection despite the thematic emphasis on detachment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery of the ticket to the resolution of the anomaly, with cause-effect links well-established; the tight word limit compresses the arc but doesn't distort it, though the transition from survival to hope feels slightly accelerated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (hum, weight of stones, distorted water) create an eerie yet intimate atmosphere; the gravitational anomaly and garage setting symbiotically enhance the theme of impermanence, though the birdsong epiphany risks sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones as "river-worn survivors," fear as a "knot") and subtext of releasing control elevate the narrative; the ending balances hope and ambiguity without overexplaining, though the "weightless space where fear had been" leans toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh integration of surreal elements (upward spiderweb, liquid glass puddle) avoids tropes; emotional nuance emerges through tactile restraint rather than stating feelings, though "affection dangerously close to affection" risks redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole; the brevity feels intentional, leveraging symbolism and tone to imply depth. The ending lingers but could benefit from a sharper final image to crystallize the transformation.</comment>
