<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character shows thoughtful exploration of artistic tension through actions with puzzle ring and sculpture, but remains somewhat abstract as a person beyond their role as an artist. Motivation is conceptually clear but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a disciplined arc from tension to creative breakthrough within tight constraints. Implantation action drives transformation logically, though pacing veers toward rushed conclusion without deeper conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly realized through vivid, specific sensory details of desert textures, bone fossils, and warped light. Setting feels mythic yet tangible, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong literary craft evident in metaphors about artistic tension and creation from failure. Ending resonates thematically but could have more emotional weight. Subtext about recontextualizing "almost" sustains impact.</comment>
