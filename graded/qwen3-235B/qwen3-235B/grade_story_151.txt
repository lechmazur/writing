<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation and internal logic feel abstract, not deeply human; reactions are metaphorically rendered but lack tangible emotional depth or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on abrupt, symbolic escalations; pacing within the word limit sacrifices some nuance in cause-effect transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (cold, light, decay) create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere; timeframe’s implications are underexplored beyond surface-level desolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Layered use of metaphor (e.g., snowflakes as rebellion) and symbolic resolution are intellectually resonant, but emotional impact feels mediated through abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids major AI clichés with fresh imagery and thematic complexity; some phrases strain toward poetic weight, bordering on purple prose without losing coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven but occasionally forced (e.g., wedding veil’s symbolic pivot); ambition outpaces full execution within strict constraints.</comment>
