<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains symbolic rather than deeply humanized; motivations (language of flowers, grief) are present but insufficiently tethered to concrete actions or evolution. Spinelessness lacks tangible manifestations in decisions or interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure follows poetic progression but lacks causal urgency; transitions (e.g., owl cracking → roots splitting concrete) feel more atmospheric than plot-driven. Completeness hinges on metaphor rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse city’s claustrophobic beauty and toxic sky are rendered through crystalline sensory language (glazed eyes, sodium lamps, ash-fed soil), creating a living, suffocating world that amplifies the story’s existential tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</comment><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flowers as grief/language, fractured owl) elevates the text, but emotional impact is undercut by overreliance on static reflection over active stakes. The ending’s thematic resonance lingers, albeit vaguely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors compete with overwritten passages (e.g., "polarity of sorrow and hope grew in tangled vines"). Tonic cheer avoids direct clichés but occasionally verges on abstract affectation rather than earned originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are meticulously chosen but unevenly fused; the story’s ambition exceeds its execution. The constrained form elevates atmosphere over cohesion, leaving some themes (e.g., boundary dissolution) underharvested.</comment>
