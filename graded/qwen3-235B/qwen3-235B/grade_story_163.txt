<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's bitter optimism is present but underexplored; motivation tied to family legacy lacks deeper psychological complexity, though fragmented reality and multiversal selves cleverly externalize internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but leans heavily on narrative contrivances (e.g., parking stub's sudden functionality); pacing is uneven at times, with some concepts (e.g., multiverse reconciliation) underdeveloped despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are immersive and viscerally rendered, though occasional over-reliance on dense metaphors threatens cohesion; bioluminescent fungi and gravity-defying coffee vividly enhance tone but occasionally overshadow character focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor-driven prose conveys existential tension; ending lands with thematic resonance (survival vs. control), though some literary devices (e.g., rearview mirror doppelgänger) edge toward overfamiliarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("wounds she could see") and relies on emotionally resonant but not fully subversive tropes like the vanished genius parent; tone is distinctive but occasionally inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly organic and thematically interwoven, though some (e.g., parking stub) feel overstated; brevity serves the story’s mystery but occasionally sacrifices narrative clarity; leaves lingering questions without undermining impact.</comment>
