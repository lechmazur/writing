<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (finding wisdom to save village) drives actions but inner conflict with mother's legacy needs more nuance; distinct voice obscured by dense prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from stagnation to epiphany; tight word limit sacrifices secondary stakes but maintains cohesion through symbolic unraveling/resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (gold-rooted plants, mist-congealed ghost) and eerie atmosphere amplify thematic tension between decay and rebirth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with paradox-driven magic system; prose occasionally florid but mostly purposeful; emotional beats shown through action, not overtelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interwoven to explore theme; brevity feels intentional; lingering question about perception vs. reality elevates narrative beyond plot.</comment>
