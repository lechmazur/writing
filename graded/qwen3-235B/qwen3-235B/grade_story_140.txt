<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is tethered to loss but lacks visceral exploration of trauma; emotional depth remains atmospheric rather than psychologically immersive. Actions align with "tortured" archetype but lack idiosyncratic nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Circular structure from doll to dust works thematically but feels contrived; planetarium's introduction disrupts pacing; gateway sequence prioritizes spectacle over clear stakes, weakening narrative causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Decay and residual magic are vividly textured through fractured mirrors, creaking carousel sounds, and syrupy sweetness; atmosphere embodies "denied fate" but occasionally drowns in excessive adjectives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "hands forged in dawn" and recursive lullaby symbolism elevate thematic coherence; ending avoids resolution to suggest cyclical duty, but emotional engagement hinges on appreciation for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in merging circus grotesquerie with cosmic horror; avoids clich√© through "sweet rot" duality. Some phrases verge on ornate, but subtext of parental grief as portal key feels profoundly human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into haunting whole but strain under brevity; planetarium/doll connection feels imposed rather than organic; compactness amplifies mythic tone but sacrifices visceral character investment.</comment>
