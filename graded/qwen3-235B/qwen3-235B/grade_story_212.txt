<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but interiority feels abstract, relying on poetic gestures over concrete emotional beats. Voice is distinct but lacks multidimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression through mystical elements is cohesive but the brevity truncates development; the aquifer sequence connects well to the ending, though the temporal leaps risk diluted tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal plains and post-war decay merged beautifully; sensory details like 'liquid glass' and 'roots rewriting songs' create immersive, haunting atmosphere that amplifies thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., seeds as memory, boundaries as song) evoke layered meaning. Ending's transformation of dirge to lullaby is poignant, though emotional undercurrents sometimes verge on stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids formula with trick cards and moonlight-consuming seeds, but phrases like 'raw solace' and 'smoke-eyed' lean toward stylization over substance. Mix of fresh and occasionally overfamiliar imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere but depend on mystical logic; the story transcends its framework through thematic ambition, though some components feel conceptually prioritized over organic character/societal exploration.</comment>
