<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragments of emotional conflict present but underdeveloped; motivations hinted at through atmosphere rather than lived experience; inconsistent connection between the spy’s actions and their stated rationale for transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Heist action drives momentum, but emotional arc collapses under word limit; cause-effect relationships between past relationships and present decisions feel truncated; ending lacks earned catharsis despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details like "drone-smog," "sterile acoustics," and "holograms that never blinked" create a cohesive, oppressive noir-futurist atmosphere that amplifies both emotional and physical stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("laugh that haunted dreams") and theme of transactional love resonate, but emotional beats often told rather than shown; serum as "synthetic soy paste" hints at deeper commentary stifled by narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre defaults with "sticky label" symbolism but stumbles into AI-typical excess ("sugar dissolving in rain"); scavenger’s betrayal lacks human nuance, feeling algorithmically inevitable rather than organically shocking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the serum and abandoned lover conceptually intertwine but unevenly execute; brevity works for mood but against thematic depth—lingers atmospherically but doesn’t fully resonate intellectually.</comment>
