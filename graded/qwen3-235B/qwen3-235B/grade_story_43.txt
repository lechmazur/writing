<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal conflict between introversion and armor's clatter is compelling but lacks layered motivations; transformation feels abrupt without deeper emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pacing stumbles during hologram revelation; some cause-and-effect connections (e.g., fireflies guiding action) rely on symbolic convenience over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive with neon decay and toxic fog; atmosphere powerfully reinforces melancholy and defiance, though sensory details occasionally lapse into excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (light vs. dark, broken CD/music) resonate deeply; ending achieves thematic cohesion, but "crooked hope" theme is stated more than embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with fireflies/cathedral fusion, but phrases like "trapped bird heart" lean toward expected; emotional resonance is felt but occasionally undercuts subtlety with explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole; brevity serves poetic impact over conventional plot, though some imagery risks feeling self-consciously "literary" rather than organic.</comment>
