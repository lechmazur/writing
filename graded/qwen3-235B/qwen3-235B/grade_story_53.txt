<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's rashness and protective nature influence her actions but lack nuanced internal conflict or growth. Solace-seeking motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through layered behavior. Voice remains poetically abstract without distinct personal dialect.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure (fortress arrival to departure) and postcard release deliver resolution, but pacing lags during cavern winds/vision sequence. Timeframe compression strains plausibility of epiphany. Cause-effect between chance route and cosmic revelation feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Viscerally rendered fortress-caverns contrast ethereal themes, but moving day timeframe adds little narrative tension. Sensory immersion excels in howling winds and postcard textures, though "moving carts" underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stellar metaphoric use of postcards as existential bridges. Ending transcends clich√© with ritualistic release gesture. Writing style's lush imagery occasionally overwhelms subtlety, but thematic coherence on cosmic interconnectedness resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("cosmos's endless story"). Emotional beats shown through sweeping metaphors rather than intimate human details. Conceptual originality compromised by familiar "sudden enlightenment" arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements paradoxically both cohesive (postcards-as-symbols) and loosely tethered (moving day periphery). Style elevates brevity's limitations, leaving lingering metaphysical questions. Unsettlingly beautiful, if occasionally self-conscious.</comment>
