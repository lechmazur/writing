<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fruitless patience drives Mireille’s actions and conflicts; the tech mogul’s corpse forces her to confront this tension. Her voice—sharp, melancholic, ironic—aligns with her role as a bridge between traditions and modernity. Nuances like her physical aches and ledger-keeping hint at deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The elongation action propels the plot, with clear cause-effect from client request to ritual execution. The tape’s glow and upload to the archive connect beginning to end, creating circularity. Pacing balances exposition and action within constraints, though the mogul’s online arguments could be more explicitly tied to his flawed legacy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</degree><comment>Sets Gothic undertaker aesthetics against sterile digital immortality. Sensory details like “liquid sky” paint and saffron pigment evoke tactile immersion. The “pixelated void” and holographic archive contrast with brass runes and silk, enhancing thematic tension. Atmosphere aligns tone (“jubilant remorse”) with the clash of reverence and nihilism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (elongation as legacy, tape’s glow as fading tradition) deepen subtext. The ending’s eulogy draft and “myth of ordinariness” linger thematically. Conflict—tradition vs. algorithmic immortality—is introduced and resolved through her ledger-keeping and ironic laughter. Writing style’s poetic precision (“sharp and bright” laughter) elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Blends gothic and cyberpunk without cliché; NFTs and online arguments ground it in modern absurdity. Avoids purple prose despite ornate descriptions. “Jubilant remorse” feels fresh, tying to rituals rather than mere grief. Some phrases (e.g., “fruitlessly patient”) risk abstraction but gain weight through action. No formulaic shifts or tonal inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>All elements cohere tightly into a poignant critique of modern legacy. The short form highlights Mireille’s resignation, avoiding sprawl. Tone and theme echo beyond the text—how analog traditions survive in digital oblivion. The brevity amplifies emotional resonance without sacrificing complexity.</comment>
