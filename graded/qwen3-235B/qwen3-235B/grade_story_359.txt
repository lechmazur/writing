<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character consistently defined by brewing preoccupation and lingering regret; motivation tied to salvaging lost dreams is clear but lacks deeper exploration of why this particular encounter reignites resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot advances through specific, symbolic actions (peppermint offering, archive recording) but feels slightly rushed in connecting train station moment to ultimate defiance; cohesive within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rain-soaked station and sterile archive create striking contrasts; sensory details (clinking glass, peppermint) immerse reader, though AI-dominated worldbuilding occasionally abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (wild yeast as compassion, fermentation as hope) elevate narrative; ending resonates thematically, though emotional resonance slightly undercut by occasional over-reliance on lyrical abstraction over concrete character revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s through inventive combinations (brewer-archivist hybrid role); some phrases ("storms of doubt") border on familiar, but symbolic motifs (lion knocker's transformation) feel original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leverages all assigned elements cohesively; story operates as a deliberate, tightly compressed parable about human perseverance against mechanization, balancing conceptual rigor with emotional undercurrents.</comment>
