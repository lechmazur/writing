<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but psychologically underdeveloped; the salesman's mockery and vulnerability feel sketched rather than fully inhabited, with internal conflict hinted but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a repair-as-metaphor arc but falters in coherenceâ€”abrupt transitions between mystical elements and philosophical musings create disjointed pacing within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through tactile imagery (moss-speckled clay, extinct-tree sap) but occasionally overwhelms narrative progression; setting and object symbiosis is strong yet overstated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Craft exhibits poetic resonance (tears-as-weight motif, time-fractured whispers) but leans on abstract introspection over concrete action; theme of impermanence is potent but unevenly dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasionally ornate prose that prioritizes style over emotional authenticity; metaphors are vivid but occasionally generic ("bag of loose buttons"), lacking visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story succeeds as lyrical meditation but struggles as structured narrative; elements cohere thematically but lose narrative urgency in service of atmospheric abstraction.</comment>
