<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's desert origins and archival mission are clear motivators, but internal conflicts remain underexplored. The ruler and apple interactions reveal obsessive curiosity, though actions occasionally feel more symbolic than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot traces a coherent arc from research to revelation, but the tightly compressed scope strains cause-effect logic. The AI's "translated love" revelation feels rushed rather than earned, weakening the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Richly textured details like sand-songs and magnetic silk create a compelling atmosphere. However, some elements (e.g., the skeletal tree's connection to Earth) feel conceptually underdeveloped despite vivid descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (vine-grown gears, lullaby codes) resonate, but the central theme of "measured miracles" lacks sufficient subtextual unpacking. Ending evokes wonder but leaves emotional threads ambiguously suspended.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality in merging mechanics with organic decay is strong, while phrases like "weight of a choice" verge on clich√©. Sensory details are specific but occasionally oversaturated, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is admirable given structural constraints, particularly the apple's fall mirroring the AI's "expiration." Some conceptual threads are sacrificed to brevity, but lingering questions about archiving emotion feel purposefully provocative.</comment>
