<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Observer's aggressive kindness shapes actions, but lacks evolution; motivation is clear but motivations feel abstract, not grounded in discernible history/trauma. No distinct voice in third-person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing manages tension within word limit; whale call as action propels plot effectively. Connection between dancer's stage moment and lighthouse activation is abrupt though. Clear arc exists but resolution feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie, mythic atmosphere is masterfully built through sensory details (salt-stung creaks, whale-song resonance). Setting-object-character interconnection (driftwood whistle) is organic. Timeframe remains a plot hinge, not fully integrated thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (tectonic memory, "brazen calm") elevate; subtext about cultural erosion resonates. Ending delivers haunting thematic closure. Writing style occasionally over-ornate but generally purposeful. Central conflict (preservation vs. erasure) is potent and thematically consistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre templates, though "ghostly guardian" trope is slightly conventional. Sensory details specific but some poetic phrasing edges into excess. Emotion is shown through ripple effects rather than stating, but character interiority remains scarce. Originality in merging oceanic/mythic motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively; brevity feels intentional. Style balances poetic and precise, enhancing atmosphere. Lingering thematic questions about legacy/revival emerge naturally. Overarching emotional weight just shy of transcendent depth.</comment>
