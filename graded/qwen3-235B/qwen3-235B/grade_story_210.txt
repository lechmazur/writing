<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivation implied but lacks distinct emotional depth or personal stakes despite their academic-arcane conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured within constraints, though the transition from solving the crossword to activating the beacon feels slightly contrived despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail creates haunting atmosphere, but overuse of phrases like "whispering wood" occasionally muddies immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (crossword as map, lighthouse as bridge) are resonant, and thematic closure effectively ties subtext to action, though pacing near the climax strains believability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but flirts with purple prose; some imagery (e.g., "ink washed from parchment") feels derivative despite fresh central concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>All assigned elements are woven into the narrative, yet some (timeframe, "doubly singular") feel tenuously connected rather than organically essential.</comment>
