<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elric's distrust and docility shape his motivations but lack deeper exploration of how these traits influence his final decision. His voice remains underdeveloped, and his abrupt shift from secrecy to teaching feels under-supported.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from machine failure to revelation to resolution, with clear cause-effect. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in middle sections. The ending ties back to the opening, achieving a clear arc but leaving some thematic resonance unexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (soot, gears, brass) and the surreal atmosphere blend effectively. The setting’s decay contrasts with the hope of invention, though the guild hall’s thematic ties to 'unknown histories' could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (seashell, jettisoning candlestick) deepen meaning. The ending resolves Elric’s internal conflict but could delve further into emotional nuance. The theme of release over possession is clear and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original use of a sewing machine as magical device avoids fantasy tropes. Some descriptions lean into ornate phrasing (e.g., "hum of invention") without humanizing Elric fully. The subtext about distrust is fresh but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful but falls short of exceptional impact. The brevity enhances momentum but limits deeper character exploration. The ending lingers but could provoke more complex reflection.</comment>
