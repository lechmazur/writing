<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (to inspire future compassion) is clear, but her internal depth, emotional complexity, and evolution remain thin; her voice blends into the poetic prose rather than standing distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arc from discovery to legacy is coherent but feels compressed; transitions between timeframes and actions are smooth yet occasionally rushed, slightly diluting emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is lush and immersive, with visceral sensory details (venomous lake, skeletal palace) that amplify tone and theme; setting acts as a character itself, flawlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and symbolic motifs (ice, light, scuff marks) evoke lingering emotional resonance; some thematic points lean toward exposition, but the ending’s metaphorical clarity elevates the whole.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive fusion of science (frozen satellite code) and myth; prose is ornate but rarely gratuitous, balancing originality with purposeful language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements cohere with elegant inevitability; each choice (e.g., melting glaciers, coded scuff marks) feels deliberate and symbolic, leaving lasting thematic and aesthetic imprints.</comment>
