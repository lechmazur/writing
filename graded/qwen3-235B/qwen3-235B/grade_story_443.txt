<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character is emotionally textured through symbolic actions (pocketing seeds, trembling while planting) rather than exposition, but lacks dimensionality—heartbreak motif remains abstract, motivation to map springs feels secondary to atmospheric elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows fluidly through symbolic progression (seeds → library → spring), but lacks narrative tension; the lack of conflict or resistance weakens the arc’s urgency despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered—synesthetic details (petrified roots humming, constellations trapped in dust) fuse with emotional resonance; setting functions as an extension of the reaper’s psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (grief as "softly thunderous," healing through "seeds") are evocative; subtext of mapping inner scars ties to theme. Ending balances ambiguity with emotional closure, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery borders on overwrought ("twilight-streaked feathers," "whispers clinging"); some phrases feel formulaic ("joy of creation, terror of hoping"). Avoids major clichés but occasionally succumbs to lyrical inertia.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but unevenly—mapping springs and the library anchor the plot, while the bird’s role leans on archetypal symbolism. Lingers in the mind as a mood rather than a narrative.</comment>
