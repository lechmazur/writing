<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's physical attributes and symbolic role dominate over psychological depth; motivations are implied through ritual rather than revealed through choice or conflict. The plastic ring drives action but lacks interpersonal or internal stakes beyond functional requirement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight cause-effect chain (rumor arrival → lunar alignment → decision → consequence), but the brevity leaves pivotal moments (character's calculations, ferns' history) underdeveloped, undercutting emotional weight despite strong structural symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush, synesthetic description (waterfalls as voices, piano as sieve) creates palpable dread and wonder; setting feels alive, though occasional over-density of imagery risks obscuring logic (e.g., "liquid mirrors reflecting...watching faces").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (fragile ring, frozen waterfalls) to explore translation as both salvation and erasure; the ending delivers visceral satisfaction while evoking philosophical questions about gatekeeping knowledge through abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes (guardian, sentient nature) through surreal execution; minimal tell-don't-show violations; tonal consistency sustains the fever-dream logic despite occasional overadorned phrasing ("fertile, fevered soil").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>All elements are tightly interwoven, but the story leans on poetic density over narrative momentum; the short length feels intentional yet leaves emotional resonance uneven between visceral scenes (ring cracking) and conceptual abstractions ("dream-language").</comment>
