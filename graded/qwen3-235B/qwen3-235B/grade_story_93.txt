<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations tied to plot but not fully developed beyond immediate actions and inherited purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but suffers from compressed pacing—key transitions (e.g., accessing the node) feel abrupt despite clever integration of constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically rich (failed algorithms, labyrinthine data), but some sensory details lack specificity to anchor the reader fully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (geometry as memory, bridges of motion) and lyrical prose elevate impact, though subtext about collective collapse feels partially unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Daring use of AI-resistant elements (e.g., “moth-wing projector”) and fresh metaphors counterbalance occasional ornate descriptions that risk disengagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize conceptually, but the story’s brevity leaves some threads (e.g., partner’s unresolved farewell) underdeveloped despite lingering thematic power.</comment>
