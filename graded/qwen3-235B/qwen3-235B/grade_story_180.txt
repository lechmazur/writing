<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character is psychologically nuanced through layered symbolism (shipwrecks, needlework), but motivation (atonement) lacks visceral specificity in connecting past transgressions to present actions beyond lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a fragile cohesion between micro-moments (stitching, microscope activation), but the arc’s emotional progression feels under-earned; the resolution is poetically resonant but structurally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously crafted—brine, shadows, moss—blending decay and rebirth; sensory details (e.g., fingerprints like “tiny galaxies”) create an immersive, liminal world that mirrors internal states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storytelling uses metaphor (e.g., thread as hope) and subtext (abandonment, magic as trauma) effectively; the ending’s symbolic weight succeeds, though some thematic threads (control vs. listening) feel compressed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through surreal juxtapositions (knitting needles with magic, eclipse residue), but occasional ornate phrasing (“whispering ballads of unfinished voyages”) borders on self-indulgent; emotional arcs are shown, not just stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole; the brevity works as a vignette of transformation. Some tension between abstract introspection and narrative momentum weakens broader resonance.</comment>
