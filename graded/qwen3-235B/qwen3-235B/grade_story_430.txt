<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's closed-off nature and generational trauma are established, but their internal shifts feel abrupt; motivations are implied through actions but lack gradual development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from rejection to tentative acceptance, with cause-effect clear, but compressed arc relies heavily on symbolic gestures over tangible progression; ending feels abrupt within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotesque yet hopeful setting vividly anchors theme; sensory details (rotting lilies, warped benches) mirror emotional dissonance, though park’s “mirrors fracturing time” strain coherence slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose layers metaphor (“arithmetic of want”), subtext (chains as crowns), and resonant theme of inherited guilt; ending’s lullaby contrasts mother’s silence for emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, original imagery dominates, though occasional phrases (“rusted bells”) verge on cliché; avoids formulaic structure but risks overwrought prose with excessive adjectives (“serrated purr”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Holistic integration of elements like peppermint/starlight motif succeeds; some narrative weight relies on poetic abstraction over concrete character or plot resolution, yet lingers thematically.</comment>
