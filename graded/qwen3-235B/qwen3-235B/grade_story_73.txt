<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gestures toward motivation but lacks emotional depth; actions imply grief and duty but inner conflict remains opaque. The "voice" is atmospheric but not fully individuated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ritual action propels plot but resolution feels abrupt; beginning/end connection is symbolic rather than earned through character. Pacing balances lyricism and momentum within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Colliding anachronisms (subway maps/ancient glyphs) create visceral cognitive dissonance. Sensory details (copal/diesel) anchor the uncanny, making myth tangibly lived-in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("kindrelizing time") and motifs (broken lenses) resonate thematically. Ending earns its poetic ambiguity rather than feeling arbitrary. Conflict between preservation and erasure reverberates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but skirts self-indulgence; some phrases ("laughing gods") border on ornamental. Emotional resonance emerges through ritualized actions, not exposition. Voice remains distinctive without artificial flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements organically while maintaining thematic rigor. The brevity sharpens focus on existential stakes. Leaves lingering unease about memory's fragility in contested spaces.</comment>
