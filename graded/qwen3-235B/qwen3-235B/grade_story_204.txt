<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's professional role as a listener is underexploited; their motivation (uncovering father's truth) emerges late and feels externally imposed rather than organically derived from their established profession. Emotional shifts (re: prejudice) occur too quickly for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure is conceptually tight but unevenly paced – the punch discovery lacks sufficient stakes, while the climax's revelations arrive compressed, sacrificing depth. Cause-effect between the punch's activation and character realizations feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually vivid and tonally cohesive – the juxtaposition of lavender comfort against oxidized steel decay creates visceral contrasts. The abandoned hangar's spectral remnants effectively mirror internal rot, though "hush before speech" framing feels loosely integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphor usage (punch as inherited guilt, fraying scarf as empathy fatigue) elevates the narrative. The ending's thematic pivot from "touch sufficing" to "naming new rules" is emotionally resonant. Dialogue could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids obvious tropes but occasionally slips into poetic overreach ("dusk pooled," "acceptance speech rehearsed"). Some emotional beats (e.g., prejudice realization) feel stated rather than earned. Sensory details compensate for occasional structural looseness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story successfully unites most elements but leans too heavily on device-driven exposition (punch as infodump mechanism). The compressed format creates narrative urgency while sacrificing deeper exploration of the radiation-scarred woman's perspective, an missed opportunity.</comment>
