<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent with their actions, but lacks emotional depth; their idealism never confronts moral ambiguity or personal cost, making defiance feel facile rather than hard-won. The 'strangely honest eyes' gesture is effective but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from documentation to resistance to collapse with admirable compression, but key transitions (siege, regime fall) feel perfunctory. Bottles as rebellion devices drive action but aren't fully integrated with the aristocrat's personal transformation, which remains implicit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (dyed threads, groaning swift, swamp flora) create immersive, mythic atmosphere. Setting's symbolism aligns with themes, though fortress as archive feels underused beyond plot convenience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story resonates through layered metaphors (weaving as memory, bottles as seeds of rebellion). The ending avoids triumphalism by circling back to the swamp, suggesting cyclical struggle. Subtext about narrative agency elevates beyond surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique elements like the yarn swift and mythic timeframe, but some phrases (e.g., "relentless, humble act") border on sentimental. Emotional depth mostly shown through symbolic objects rather than interiority, maintaining originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified allegory about storytelling's power, though brief length strains depiction of temporal shifts. The aristocrat's final scene with a new swift invites reflection but lacks visceral intensity to make the theme indelible.</comment>
