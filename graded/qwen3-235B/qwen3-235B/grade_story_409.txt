<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to extinguish self-deception aligns with his arc, but the transition from self-loathing to resolve feels underdeveloped despite vivid reactions to the shard and lion; his 'skillful incompetence' shapes action but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shard's abduction into a dream drives the plot, but the cavern sequence rushes the thematic payoff; the connection between attic and dream lacks causal logic, while the ending's circularity (dust, clockwork animals) provides coherence but feels overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Attic's sensory details (dust, rusted animals, bruised light) create a tactile, decaying world; the cavern's mirrored chaos contrasts the attic's stagnation, though the sculptor's chisel moment strains temporal coherence with its symbolic abruptness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirrors shattering through inaction, lion as repressed self) evoke layered meaning; the ending avoids clich√© by framing standing as defiance rather than triumph, with visceral language elevating the theme beyond simplicity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dream-logic resolution avoids genre tropes but leans on surrealism as a narrative shortcut; some phrases ("whirring gears and shadow") veer into ornate abstraction, though the subversion of 'competence' as armor is inventively executed within genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements are deftly interwoven, with the brevity emphasizing thematic compression over plot; the story lingers in its exploration of shame and reclamation, though the attic's symbolic recurrence feels slightly didactic.</comment>
