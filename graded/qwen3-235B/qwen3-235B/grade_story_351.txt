<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character defined by poetic sensibility and guilt, but lacks nuanced emotional progression; motivation (penance) revealed too late to fully shape actions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear progression through cryptic decoding to metaphysical revelation, but resolution feels abrupt; cyclical time loop concept introduced too late for full cohesion</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative decay and spectral atmosphere masterfully rendered through precise sensory details (ivy's movement, sundial's quivering shadow), though supernatural logistics remain underspecified</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (sundial as timekeeper/catalyst, names as ghostly imprints) elevates narrative, yet emotional payoff diluted by overly abstract resolution</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vividly original imagery balances on edge of poetic beauty and ornate excess; some phrases like "names etched into stone, each syllable a ghost's sigh" verge on mannerism</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into haunting whole despite occasional overwritten passages; atmospheric consistency and thematic focus on memory redeem minor structural flaws</comment>
