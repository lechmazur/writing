<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations (obsession with glyphs, colleague's disappearance) are clear but underexplored; his internal conflict remains atmospheric rather than psychologically detailed, making him a conduit for plot rather than a fully realized figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through glyph-driven urgency, but the tight word limit strains the transition from scramble to revelation; celestial mechanics and temple collapse feel rushed despite logical cause-effect chains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, contrast-rich atmosphere (solar lanterns vs. ancient glyphs, Wi-Fi vs. divination) merges modern and mystic with sensory precision, though the camp's texture sometimes overpowers its narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (coffee constellations, glyphs-as-drug) deepen theme of obsession; ending resonates as both conclusion and ominous continuation, though emotional impact leans more on tone than character specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept (tech-nomad meets sea-myth), but some phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction ("jittery shadows") rather than gritty authenticity; pacing occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive, haunting whole despite occasional contrivance; the brevity enhances mystery rather than limitation; themes of unresolved pasts and fragile seals linger.</comment>
