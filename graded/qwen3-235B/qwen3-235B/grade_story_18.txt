<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Statue's tragic joy is present but more atmospheric than deeply explored; motivation is clear but psychological depth could be stronger despite resonant gestures toward creator's legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot connects beginning and end but condenses emotional arc too abruptly; recognition scene feels earned yet pacing strains under compressed revelations and worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steam-powered square's grime and clocktower effectively mirror statue's duality; sensory details (ink, steam hiss, rain) powerfully anchor tone and thematic parallels between machinery and artistry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (hair tie as "relic," gears as memory vessels) elevate impact; subtext about art's endurance resonates, though character emotions occasionally verge on stated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s despite dense symbolism; flowery moments are purposeful (e.g., "joy and sorrow flowing"); emotional resonance stems from precise imagery over formulaic emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (truth, legacy) but uneven integration; steam setting remains backdrop rather than narrative engine; compact form feels intentional but strains execution of complex revelations.</comment>
