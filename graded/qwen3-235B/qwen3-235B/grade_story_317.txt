<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Android’s motivation as former caretaker is clear, regret over past inaction drives actions. Nuanced blend of mechanical traits + conflicted nostalgia. Lacks human emotional depth but gains through thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured despite brevity: threat introduced, decision, resolution. Some rushed transitions (e.g., containment field solution), but causality and pacing remain coherent within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is immersive: collapsing facility, writhing crystals, metallic tang, dawn’s light. Atmosphere of decay and tension complements themes of collapse and rebirth. Sensory details consistently evoke mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (betrayal as repeating pattern) enhance thematic depth. Ending avoids melodrama, implies broader reflection on agency. Subtle “showing” through Epsilon’s decisive action and symbolic telescope use.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes (android as passive observer subverted), but some lines strain toward poetic abstraction (“brazen modesty”) over clarity. Logical reactions but underexplored emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve story logic: crystals mirror past betrayal, dawn underscores cyclical themes. Seamless integration of setting, action, and character. Lingering resonance stems from thematic cohesion over plot twists.</comment>
