<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to access lost memories through mapping drives actions, but interiority remains sparse; rituals and interactions with Sam suggest depth without full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; collapse of tunnels and Sam’s projector failure create tension; resolution with the Heart of Glass feels earned, though pacing of final revelations slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Richly immersive sensory details in the crystalline cave deepen motif of light vs. darkness; blending of bioluminescence, filmic echoes, and spectral miners creates a cohesive, haunting atmosphere that mirrors the necromancer's existential quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism of the cap’s dissolution and projector’s "ghost hum" elevate theme of memory as fragile yet enduring artifice; ending resonates with quiet gravitas, though subtext on media impermanence could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through fusion of necromancy with cinematic nostalgia; metaphors feel purposeful but occasionally verge on precious; emotional beats (e.g., Sam’s glitched Bogart voice) feel nuanced, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a mythic parable about preservation; brevity enhances focus on core image of the cap’s final pulse; lingers as a meditation on obsessions that defy futility.</comment>
