<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character is evocative but sketchy—motivations felt through metaphor rather than emotional specificity; actions align with "belonging nowhere" theme but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant circular structure with mirror framing; carbonizing action drives both plot and symbolism; pacing is deliberate but risks feeling static in tighter word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory layering (damp soil, sound of leaves) creates haunting atmospherics; setting merges with theme through ecosystem-as-confessional; tone consistently ethereal yet grounded in tactile details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic resonance (war/growth, destruction/rebirth); ending carries mythic weight; "showing" dominates but some abstractions dilute emotional immediacy; theme of fractured identity lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (carbonized leaves as grief preservation) shine; avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into lyrical vagueness; emotional nuance implied through ritualized actions rather than explicit states.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements fused with poetic logic; brevity amplifies mystery but weakens causal clarity; memorable for its conceptual density and haunting closure.</comment>
