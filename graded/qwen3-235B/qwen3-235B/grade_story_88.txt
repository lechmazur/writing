<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ember’s AI nature limits emotional stakes; character voice is overwritten but lacks depth; motivations tied to programmed archiving feel insufficiently evolved into genuine curiosity or empathy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic progression and cyclical structure work within word constraints; lanterns as plot engine effective, though some transitions risk feeling mystical rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visionary fusion of Sumerian archaeology and speculative tech creates cohesive, immersive dissonance; sensory details (cuneiform smoke, holographic canals) amplify mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (lantern math as migration verses, glyphs as evolving narrative) and thematic unity around origin/loss transcend gimmickry; ending resonates with mythic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dense poeticism occasionally veers toward overwritten prose, but original combinations (Sumerian base-12 poetry, quantum palaces) save from cliché; emotional subtext shown through glyphs, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements feel purpose-built for narrative alchemy; tight interweaving of setting, character, and theme avoids checklist syndrome; tone shifts feel intentional, not erratic.</comment>
