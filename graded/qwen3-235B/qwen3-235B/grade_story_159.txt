<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Action and motivation align with core betrayal theme, but insufficient nuance in showing psychological evolution after exile. Overly abstract character voice lacks distinctiveness beyond mythic archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression through symbolic episodes maintains coherence but relies too heavily on contrived "100th wedding" coincidence. Resolution feels rushed despite strong thematic connection between inciting betrayal and final revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive through precise lexicon ("sandstone labyrinth," "floating lanterns"), but emotional weight of atmosphere doesn't fully materialize. Sensory details prioritize aesthetic appeal over psychological resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical symbolism ("confetti as answers") and paradoxical theme succeed, but lacks emotional gut-punch from overly compressed character arc. Metaphor density occasionally undermines narrative momentum in final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through mythopoeic abstraction, but excessive adjectives/philosophical abstraction border on purple prose. Character psychology remains too opaque to feel human rather than allegorical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements interweave skillfully but lack transformative execution. The compressed format sacrifices emotional investment despite elegant thematic scaffolding. Lingering intellectual resonance outweighs visceral impact.</comment>
