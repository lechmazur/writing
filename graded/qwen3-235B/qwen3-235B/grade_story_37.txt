<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth in showing transformation from con artist to guardian; motivations tied to terminal illness feel abrupt but gains traction through physical symbiosis with seedpod and concrete gesture of organ donation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightly coiled flashback structure works within constraints but relies excessively on exposition in pivotal shaman confrontation; resolution feels earned through cyclical imagery of fire and renewal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical sensory details (earth/sap scents, cracking cavern tones) and visceral plant symbiosis create immersive tension; urban/rainforest duality enhances thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (fire-as-legacy, lungs-as-soil) resonate powerfully; dialogue occasionally stilted but redeemed by haunting final lines; subtext about truth/destruction interplay lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through botanical horror-mysticism blend; some overwritten phrases ("cracked like sugar in rain") but overall distinctive voice; emotional logic of guilt/redemption feels earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements merged organically despite high-concept premises; brevity amplifies thematic impact; leaves haunting paradox about sacrifice/legacy through biological transformation.</comment>
