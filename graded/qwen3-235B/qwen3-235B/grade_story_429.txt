<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivations grounded in cultural reclamation are clear, but inner conflicts remain underdeveloped. Actions align with traditional role, yet psychological depth lacks nuance beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured narrative arc within constraints, with methodically paced cause-and-effect sequences. Ritual's progression logically connects beginning to resonant closure without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, sensorially rich atmosphere merges with thematic elements—auroras reflect ancestral voices, tactile details like "sugar-glaze-stardust" crystallize memory-physicality connections. Setting isn't decorative but conceptually integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (scale as tradition-measure, resin as preserved time) create haunting emotional resonance. Subtext about cultural continuity through reinvention emerges organically from material alchemy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing despite lyrical style; metaphors like "needle trembling like a divining rod" achieve originality. Voice maintains stylistic consistency while balancing poetic precision against emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion across constrained elements—each component (soil/resin, sound/silence) interweaves to explore memory-as-material. Subtle thematic symmetries suggest careful authorial shaping rather than arbitrary assembly.</comment>
