<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thaddeus has a distinct voice and consistent "wisely foolish" duality, but motivations lack psychological complexity. His relaxed pathfinding and interactions feel purposeful but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing manages complete arc within constraints; the trail of notes cohesively connects beginning/middle/end. Plot progression through ghostly interactions and piano resolution feels logical but slightly rushed in transitional moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (mildew/frost/ink shadows) create immersive atmosphere. Timeframe and setting enhance thematic tension between winter's end and supernatural elements, though cellar specifics remain underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Earnest absurdity creates emotional resonance through metaphor-rich storytelling. Subtext about stifled voices and creative liberation emerges organically. Dialogue serves character/plot duality; ending successfully reframes "foolishness" as thematic strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original integration of paranormal and musical metaphors avoids genre clich√©s. Avoids purple prose through precise imagery ("prismatic slivers of stifled voices"). Subtly nuanced character reactions (ghost's laughter shaking dust) avoid explicit emotion-telegraphing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion (lens enables pivotal revelations). Stylistic economy supports tight pacing; winter-to-spring transition mirrors character arc. Lingering thematic questions about artistic freedom compensate for slight underdevelopment of secondary motifs.</comment>
