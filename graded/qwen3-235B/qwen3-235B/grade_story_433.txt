<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness and brokenness are evident but motivations lack nuanced exploration; emotional depth feels implied rather than deeply realized through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit but pivotal transitions (e.g., deciphering prophecies) feel rushed; thematic resolution is satisfying despite tight pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an evocative atmosphere, but the ephemeral gallery’s connection to the core theme feels underdeveloped and occasionally abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyricism elevates the storytelling, with potent metaphors and layered themes about impermanence; emotional resonance relies too heavily on poetic abstraction at times.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with fresh imagery (frozen fire, melting gallery), but occasional overwrought phrasing ("dreamlike pull") and stated emotions risk veering into stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and purposeful brevity; some elements (e.g., prophecies) feel slightly forced rather than organic, but the ending lingers effectively.</comment>
