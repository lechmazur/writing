<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits as a silent archivist are clear and consistent, but lack depth beyond his assigned role; motivation to document seasonal shifts drives actions but his nobility title adds little substance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Focused narrative arc within word constraint, with thematic connection between beginning and ending; pacing is deliberate but occasionally slows momentum through excessive description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich atmosphere through phosphorescent decay and root-bone entanglement; setting deeply informs both character motivation and symbolic resonance of the unknown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original integration of decay-sustained orchard and untranslatable seasonal shifts; avoids genre tropes but occasionally strains plausibility through overly abstract descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive contemplation on impermanence; brevity amplifies thematic weight rather than limiting it, though character dimensionality suffers.</comment>
