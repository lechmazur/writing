<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength in quiet defiance shaping actions, but motivation lacks psychological depth. Actions align with rebellion theme, but inner conflict remains underexplored despite lyrical exteriority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent cyclical arc forged between projected past and ignited present, though the climax's "eruption" risks narrative whiplash from careful build-up to abrupt transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory fusion of decay and luminance creates immersive atmosphere. The repair shop's electro-mystical decay exemplifies setting as character, though timeframe's "hush" could manifest more audibly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (e.g., "soldered melodies") and layered tension between preservation/destruction. Ending risks thematic overstatement, but the image of cynics' ashes elevates subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tech-mysticism avoids genre tropes, though occasional phrases ("parade's orphaned light") lean toward sentimental abstraction rather than earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into mythopoeic whole despite artificial constraints. The parade's ghostly reincarnation through physical objects demonstrates inventive thematic binding.</comment>
