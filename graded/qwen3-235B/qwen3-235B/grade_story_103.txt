<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The knight’s internal conflict—his lifelong grudge against regret—is palpable, but his backstory feels allusive rather than deeply explored. His actions (choosing sacrifice via symbolic items) align with his motivation, yet his distinct voice remains muted due to the narrative’s dense poeticism overshadowing personal rawness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot’s urgency—the choice to silence regret—is clear, but the rapid progression from arrival at the lighthouse to the cage imploding feels compressed. The symbolic method (items forming a pattern) drives the story but lacks explicit logic, slightly undercutting the payoff’s cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison’s oppressive atmosphere is masterfully rendered: the reef’s “gnawing” salt spray, the mirrors’ fragmented selves, the storm’s “warped” shimmer. Each detail amplifies the knight’s psychological torment, merging setting and emotion into a visceral, haunting experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story’s central tension—sacrificing a self to silence regret—is emotionally resonant, elevated by metaphors like the “crystalline cage.” The ending’s fleeting peace (“boy smiling at fireflies”) lingers, though some subtlety in character psychology is lost amid lush imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés, subverting the “prison” trope into a psychological arena. However, phrases like “screamed against stone” and “moth-eaten glove” occasionally verge on Gothic overfamiliarity. The balance between poetic language and clarity is mostly maintained, though some lines risk becoming ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story weaves assigned elements into a cohesive whole—mirrors, items, and impossible choices shape the knight’s arc. The brief length amplifies the intensity but leaves some themes (e.g., time’s imprisonment) underexplored. The final image of the reclaimed self is haunting, suggesting depth beyond the explicit.</comment>
