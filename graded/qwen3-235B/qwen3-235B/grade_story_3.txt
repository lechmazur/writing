<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Surly trait drives character's arc, yarn interaction reveals depth, transformation from burden to liberation feels earned but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story follows coherent arc but resolution feels abrupt; weaving motif ties elements together but pacing lacks rhythmic urgency required for complete satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (lichen mimicking knots, frost-kissed stone) create immersive, elemental atmosphere that breathes cosmic tension without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphors layered yet precise; ending achieves thematic grace note rather than neat resolution; subtext about exchange as spiritual currency resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("eternal argument with the shore") risk poetic overload, but knot-reading specificity and market-as-spiritual-arena framework feel authentically strange and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve story thematically but occasionally feel like symbolic checklist; brevity works for mystery, not necessarily revelation.</comment>
