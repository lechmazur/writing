<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thyme's critical nature and secrecy are well-integrated into her role as a midwife and memory-retriever; motivation to reclaim stolen memories drives her actions cohesively, though emotional depth in pivotal moments feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to transcendence with efficient pacing, but the abrupt resolution of the maelstrom and dense exposition about her mother's fate strain coherence within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with sensory details (scent of burning herbs, argent moonlight, rustling leaves) perfectly mirrors the dissonant calm tone and reinforces the cursed-island setting’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("roots thriving unseen") and lyrical imagery creates emotional resonance; the ending’s thematic clarity about endings as midwives elevates the narrative, though some phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Original mythic resonance undercut slightly by familiar sacrificial-curse tropes; language occasionally prioritizes poetic flourishes over precision, and some character psychology (e.g., Thyme’s calm after learning her mother’s fate) feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense symbolism and packed mythology; the brief form sharpens the story’s emotional impact, though the final thematic leap about "endings as midwives" risks feeling abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
