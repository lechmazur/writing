<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than fully developed; motivations are implied but lack nuanced interiority. Voice feels more atmospheric than psychologically distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression; relies on poetic juxtaposition rather than cause-effect. Circular structure feels incomplete rather than purposeful in the short word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and symbolic setting amplify theme. The carnival's decay/rebirth is evocative, though some elements (mirrors' hum) stretch credibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (phoenix, mirrors) deepen meaning. Ending resonates thematically, but emotional stakes remain diffuse rather than fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery avoids clich√©, but "hammered repose" and repetitive "cradle of sparks" lean toward ornate abstraction. Emotional subtext feels implied rather than organically shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere and symbolic cohesion undercut by lack of narrative momentum and thematic vagueness. Style occasionally overshadows substance.</comment>
