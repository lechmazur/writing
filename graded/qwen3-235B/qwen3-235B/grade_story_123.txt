<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The brewer's devotion to resurrecting the empire's alchemy is clear but lacks psychological depth. His transformation from emulation to absorption of the past's "morose resolve" feels abrupt. Motivation is consistent but one-dimensional, with minimal interiority despite first-person-adjacent narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic arc from discovery to rebirth, driven by the logical progression of alchemical preparation. However, the sudden emergence of vapor-forming symbols (crown/sword/truce) lacks foreshadowing. Pacing balances immersion with forward motion, though some transitions between memory and action blur.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The decaying facility becomes a character itself—the metallic scent of evaporated dreams, the dying starlight's geometry on parchment. Time’s suspension in shattered glassware and ink’s ephemerality masterfully ties setting to the theme of resilience through decay. Sensory details are relentless and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of fermentation-as-survival elevates the narrative beyond apocalypse clichés. Lingering tension between "bitter rawness" and vitality creates thematic resonance. Ending avoids tidy resolution while maintaining cohesion. However, occasional heavy-handed symbols (direct crown/sword imagery) momentarily undercut subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through the brewer’s tactile relationship with history (boots-as-gloves) and scientific/mystical synthesis. Some descriptors border on ornate ("gleefully morose satisfaction") but remain stylistically purposeful rather than purely decorative. Emotional weight emerges through physicality (trembling scuffs) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve theme without forced integration—the boots’ scuffs mirroring the realm’s fractures, starlit memories embodying lost knowledge. The tight word count feels intentional for its elegiac tone. Leaves behind the haunting question of whether resurrecting the past’s failures perpetuates those failures.</comment>
