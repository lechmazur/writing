<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Forgetfulness as a trait drives the plot but lacks deeper psychological grounding; motivation to preserve the stained glass feels reactive rather than fully explored; dialogue remains flat and detached, missing opportunities for interpersonal tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Concision works for the negotiation climax, but the setup feels rushed; Laurent’s reintroduction lacks organic buildup; cause-effect chain between the science fair and vault confrontation is logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vault’s sensory textures—dust, decaying light, symphonic vibrations—create palpable atmosphere; Parisian champagne vaults and cultural clash are visually rich but undercontextualized historically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant frequencies as metaphor for preservation is elegant; ending lands thematically but lacks emotional payoff; subtext about fragility vs. progress hinted at but insufficiently mined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cultural clash framing feels contrived; phrases like “disinterested passion” verge on cliché; tonal consistency is maintained but risks sterile detachment; imagery fresh but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres as a parable but leans on tidy resolutions; brief length obscures depth in character and worldbuilding, though concept integration is inventive yet unevenly weighted.</comment>
