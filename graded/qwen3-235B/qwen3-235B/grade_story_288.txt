<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are mostly clear but lack depth; blacksmith’s internal struggles aren’t fully explored beyond surface-level defiance, reducing emotional resonance despite symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot flows decently but feels hurried; pivotal character interactions (e.g., with child) lack development, and the central action (crafting the flag) isn’t tightly anchored to a distinct arc within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through ozone decay and decayed imagery, but the setting’s potential for deeper thematic integration with freedom/cost is underutilized, leaving worldbuilding disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolic heft (phoenix, ozone-hardened resin) elevate impact, but dialogue and emotional beats occasionally lean on vague abstraction rather than precise, character-driven subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original framing of post-apocalyptic stewardship is compelling, yet some phrasing (e.g., “bruised sky,” “unfinished ballads”) edges toward cliche, and thematic consistency wavers under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements like the flag and ozone station are integral, but paddleboarding and the quarantine’s thematic role feel forced. The story’s ambition exceeds its execution, yielding uneven cohesion.</comment>
