<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character defined more by symbolic actions than interiority; "gentle" and "joyous terror" surface but lack depth, motivation clear but unexplored psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in spots—dwarves’ emergence feels abrupt, but the circle from broken branch to reborn garden is satisfyingly cohesive within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dense sensory immersion in decayed garden and dwarven halls; atmosphere of melancholy and renewal intricately woven into setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve the theme-driven narrative cohesively; slight overreliance on poetic abstraction risks diluting emotional immediacy.</comment>
