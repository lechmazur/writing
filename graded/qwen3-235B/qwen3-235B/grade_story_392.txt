<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's skepticism is understated; motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth. Actions align with goals, but her voice remains vague despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight with a clear arc, but the climax-to-resolution transition feels rushed. Cause-effect logic holds, though the word limit strains some tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, especially the contrast between sterile dome and chaotic rain. Sensory details anchor the haunting and evocative setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. data are compelling, enhanced by striking metaphors (storms as language). Ending resonates, though subtext occasionally leans heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh use of thimbles as prison-objects. Some adjectives lean ornate, but emotional beats (e.g., smashing the sphere) feel human and visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly to theme, but rideshare overheard lines strain believability. Brevity serves the story well, leaving lingering philosophical questions about preservation.</comment>
