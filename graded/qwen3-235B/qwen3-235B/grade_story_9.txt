<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character shows surface transformation but internal logic of "panic" driving action is underdeveloped; motivation revealed through object interaction lacks psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cause-effect of unlocking box leading to rain creation maintains internal logic; some transitions feel rushed but overall arc from desperation to "miracle" coherent within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>Immersive sensory overload grounds reader in toxic utopia; neon/desert contrast creates tension; decaying environment becomes active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Resonant ending reframes opening despair; metaphor density ("middle finger" blade of grass) creates thematic echoes; dialogue avoids exposition, maintains irony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original combinations subvert dystopia tropes ("sculpting hope," "liquor store thunderclap"); some phrasing approaches baroque but never loses narrative pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements present but integration uneven; brevity amplifies final image's impact; creative repurposing of "stewardship" into defiant act works best.</comment>
