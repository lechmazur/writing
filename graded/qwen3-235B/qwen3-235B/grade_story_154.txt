<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s “strongly weak” dichotomy lacks nuanced internal conflict; motivations hinted at via plot but undercut by vague emotional states rather than concrete actions revealing personality. Dialogue minimal and flat.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a spiritual arc but feels compressed—levitation climax resolves too abruptly. Concept shapes direction, but pacing stumbles in transitions (e.g., mural to Cliffs). Coherence maintained but strained by brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting’s neon-Celtic fusion fascinates conceptually but fails to anchor cohesively. Vague descriptors (“between games of tradition and modernity”) confuse. Sensory details uneven—ink’s color-shifting is vivid, but auditory/olfactory worldbuilding absent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Levitating ink trails as metaphor for collective memory and social change resonate deeply. Ending lingers with haunting duality—ephemeral magic vs. persistent documentation. Subtext-rich without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending Celtic myth with cyberpunk, but “jubilant despair” phrase feels tropish. Minimalistic yet lyrical prose avoids over-embellishment; emotional resonance shown through tactile imagery (ink’s reaction) rather than stating.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ambitious in scope but constrained by word limit—elements coexist but lack integration. The “social change” theme is explicit but underexplored; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
