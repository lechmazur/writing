<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Decimus's moral code drives his actions effectively, but motivations lack psychological depth beyond archetypal 'truth-seeker' tropes. His Latin dialogue adds flavor but doesn't fully distinguish his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight 500-word pacing balances exposition and progression, though the ending feels slightly rushed. The 'adopt' action serves as perfect narrative pivot, connecting object/concept seamlessly to plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful fusion of Roman aesthetics and cyberpunk technology creates vivid multisensory immersion. Simulated oil lamps and Mongolian tea rituals enrich temporal dissonance, making thematic contrasts tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subtext about memory as resistance shines through precise metaphors (carving vs erasure). Ending balances hope and uncertainty beautifully, with rain functioning as meaningful narrative punctuation rather than lazy symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historic and futuristic avoids genre clich√©s. Bottle caps as currency and 'neural static' provide fresh twists. Some overprecision in descriptions ('precise inscriptions') borders on mechanical but remains purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements work in concert rather than feeling imposed, though Roman-reimagined setting occasionally leans on familiar tropes. Tea steeping as temporal anchor pays thematic dividends in surprisingly economical fashion.</comment>
