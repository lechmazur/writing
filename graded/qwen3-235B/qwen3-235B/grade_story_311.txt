<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but occasionally underexplored; Elias's transformation from loyal bodyguard to rebel occurs too abruptly. The Minister’s daughter remains underdeveloped, her agency hinted at but not fully realized within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence is mostly maintained, but key transitions (e.g., botanist/technician’s sudden allegiance) feel compressed. The lunar setting heightens tension, but the pacing often prioritizes exposition over lived-in conflict, leaving some cause-effect relationships undershadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fragile lunar greenhouse atmosphere is vividly rendered, contrasting serenity with simmering rebellion. Sensory details (Earthlight, hydroponic vines) immerse the reader, though the outpost’s faint beacon feels underutilized as a symbolic or practical endpoint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ideas of truth and rebirth resonate through persistent metaphors (e.g., photograph as growth in barren ground). Ending balances hope and resolve but leans on declarative dialogue ("We ratify our own future") that occasionally undercuts subtler storytelling strengths.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clichés, the "rebel awakening" arc treads familiar terrain. The lunar setting adds novelty, but some phrasing (e.g., "unclenching fist" as metaphor) risks formulaic gestures. Emotional beats lean on visceral imagery over nuanced introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration is generally cohesive, though "timely rebirth" and "serendipitously stubborn" feel less organically woven. The story’s brevity serves urgency but limits depth in secondary character arcs and worldbuilding.</comment>
