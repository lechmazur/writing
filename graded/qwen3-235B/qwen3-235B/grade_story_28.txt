<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Agent’s transformation from archivist to participant feels underexplored; motivations shift from clinical to emotional without sufficient tension. Dialogue provides minimal character voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (fork, carnival, family tradition) are tightly woven into a thematically rich narrative. Brief format serves the story’s introspective focus.</comment>
