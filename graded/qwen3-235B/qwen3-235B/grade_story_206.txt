<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent flora and decaying market offer vivid contrasts, but regimeâ€™s oppressive mechanics remain underdeveloped, weakening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements serve theme but strain under word count constraints; hidden continent conclusion reads more like narrative necessity than earned revelation.</comment>
