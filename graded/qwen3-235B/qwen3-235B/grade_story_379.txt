<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for preserving languages feels meaningful but slightly underexplored; the 'trickster' aspect isn't fully leveraged in key decisions. The fragmented voice works but could deepen character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong through-line with the dares driving action; transitions between memories and present tense are seamless despite brevity. Some rushed details (e.g., AI voice origins) slightly undercut cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory texture in the biodome’s decayed opulence and sonic tapestry of lost languages creates immersive atmosphere. Timeframe disorientation weakens the 'stretching' moment but doesn’t derail mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The merging of linguistic preservation with rebellion is thematically potent; the labyrinth confession metaphor elevates subtext. Dialogue in holograms lacks differentiation, though the recorder's climactic use is haunting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evasion of clichés is strong except for bounty bots/enforcers. The 'rust vs. synthetic' imagery avoids genre tropes; human-like emotional complexity in guilt/redemption arcs enhances authenticity despite some ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements interweave purposefully: the gift tag’s tracker twist salvages its thematic role, and the dare framework sustains tension without feeling forced. Brevity sharpens rather than hinders impact.</comment>
