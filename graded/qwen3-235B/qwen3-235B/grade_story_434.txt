<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited psychological depth; motivations rely on inherited duty rather than personal stakes, with minimal evidence of internal conflict or growth despite supernatural circumstances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Minimalist structure works for word limit but lacks satisfying resolution; key transitions between action beats feel abrupt, particularly the widow’s confession coinciding with climax without earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (moth-eaten stool, electric ashes) but struggles to fully integrate the conceptual elements like zero-gravity flame into a cohesive metaphysical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("laughter like broken glass") create strong impressions, though thematic throughline about inherited responsibility gets overshadowed by excessive stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subverts 'guardian of magic object' trope with unconventional mechanisms (zero-g flame, confession-fueled ritualism) but occasionally succumbs to gothic clichés in secondary descriptions ("ash and articulated dread").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Technical execution is masterful, but conceptual cohesion falters under scrutiny; elements work individually but strain at connections, creating a mosaic rather than a seamless tapestry.</comment>
