<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters have intriguing traits but lack sufficient depth; motivations feel plausible but underexplored. The woman's scarred past and the teller's archival purpose are hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a cohesive encounter arc with effective cause-effect, but the ending feels slightly abrupt despite strong internal logic. Pacing is controlled but resolution lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details (wolf-pelt, frost-berry wine) and historical undercurrents. Some elements like "storm-churned seas" need stronger contextual integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (ink as trapped lightning, scars blooming) and precise imagery create lasting impact. Emotional subtext is shown through symbolic exchanges rather than told.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through fresh conceits (emotional "seeds" in ink). Some descriptive passages flirt with ornamentation but mostly serve thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion across elements with deliberate stylistic choices. Minor gaps in character psychology prevent transcendent impact. The brevity feels purposeful but slightly constrained.</comment>
