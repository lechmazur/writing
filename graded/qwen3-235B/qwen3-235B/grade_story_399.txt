<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is symbolically rendered through physicality and environment, with trauma as a motivator, but emotional depth feels more conceptual than viscerally human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on surreal transitions between discovery, revelation, and resolution, but 400-500 word constraints leave some causal links abstract rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich gothic atmosphere with sensory details (prismatic light, textured sand), though some settings (scrying room) lean more mystical than grounded in logical cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (trauma as mosaic/constellation) resonate, but emotional resonance is occasionally diluted by abstract language rather than concrete emotional beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original in linking trauma to cosmic symbolism, but phrases like "multiply singular" risk overwrought abstraction; avoids clich√©s through haunting specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are woven together purposefully, with thematic clarity about trauma, though the brief length prioritizes poetic impact over sustained narrative engagement.</comment>
