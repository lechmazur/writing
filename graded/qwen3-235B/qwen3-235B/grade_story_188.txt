<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character internal conflict is understated but lacks visceral engagement; motivation to escape violence is clear but under-explored through action; relics-as-symbolism hints at depth but remains superficially tied to plot mechanics rather than organic personal transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented object quest provides structural skeleton but pacing strains under compressed emotional beats; cause-effect between relic discovery and yakuza confrontation feels contrived; cyclical planting motif ties beginning/end effectively but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dense atmospheric imagery (cracked lenses, skeletal castles) establishes mood but sensory details lack tactile specificity; corroded rapture tone inconsistently maintained during pivotal shrine confrontation; setting serves aesthetic rather than thematic function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegiac prose evokes quiet devastation through precise metaphors (shards as unhealed violence); memorable in its lyrical compression; some subtext about repairing history through stewardship; ending risks sentimentality but mostly earns emotional payoff through restrained symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through archetypal fusion (Western lawman/Japanese lore) but relies on familiar redemption arc; metaphorical scaffolding (cracked lenses seeing truth) borders on didacticism; dialogue sparse but functional; uneven balance between poetic abstraction and gritty realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under formal constraints; brevity sacrifices secondary character shading; elegant craftsmanship elevates structural limitations; leaves contemplation about healing mechanisms rather than simply delivering it.</comment>
