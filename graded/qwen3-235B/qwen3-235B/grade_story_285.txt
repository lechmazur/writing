<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and awkwardness are demonstrated through physical actions (stumbling, awkward gait), but emotional depth remains surface-level; motivation to restore tradition is clear yet underexplored; the postcard's evolving role hints at internal conflict but lacks sustained psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot advances logically through the bridge-building ritual, but the rushed resolution with the queen’s collapse into ash disrupts emotional stakes; cause-effect chain is coherent, though the fusion of orchards feels abrupt despite strong symbolic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, tactile details (crab-shell clacking, pulsing soil, vapor-scented twilight) create immersive duality; the setting’s contrast between frigid tundra and feverish underworld mirrors the tension between tradition and decay, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (postcard as doubt/proof, crabs as mediators) and the poignant ending elevate the story; however, character emotions often lean on abstraction (“rancor,” “resolve”) rather than visceral, embodied reactions that would deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clichés with idiosyncratic elements (bioluminescent sap, obsidian-shelled crabs); some phrasing (“half-remembered hymn”) edges toward poetic vagueness, but the central fusion of realms feels conceptually original and tonally cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a condensed parable about imperfect redemption, balancing tight constraints with thematic ambition; underdeveloped character interiority and slight narrative contrivances (queen’s abrupt submission) limit its claim to flawless publishability.</comment>
