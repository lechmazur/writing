<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's actions and motivation (using loss as fuel) align tightly with his "trapper" identity and method. Past backstory ("daughter's laughter") is hinted but thinly developed. Internal voice is distinct but emotionally distant, sacrificing deeper psychological nuance for mythic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot sustains forward momentum via siphon construction, with cause-effect (sea glass ignition → radiance harvesting → station reactivation) logically executed. Ending loops back to coordinates/commencement, but emotional payoff of "smiling" feels abrupt. Pacing balances density and flow within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and cohesive: rusted observatory corridors, metallic storm tang, "drowned god" imagery. Atmosphere merges decay and fragile hope, perfectly complementing the "gritty whimsy" tone. Sensory details (e.g., static-like sea glass sound, iridescent radiance) are sharply deployed to immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (black hole as doubt, radiance as "scream") resonate with existential weight. "Focusing grief as a lens" theme is elegantly shown through character's crafting of tools from absence. Subtext about creation/destruction cycles lingers beyond denouement. Prose balances lyricism with narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vividly original (siphoning light from black holes, radiance as consumed matter's echo) avoids genre clichés. No formulaic phrasing; language is precise yet evocative. Some borderline-ornate passages ("belly of nothingness") could lean pretentious, but generally restrained. Emotional resonance emerges through symbolic acts, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements (sea glass, observatory, microfilm) are intricately fused to theme and plot. Shifting from doubt's black hole to orbit escape feels thematically unified. Brevity amplifies impact through concentrated imagery. Ending’s "beginning again" implies cyclical struggle without over-explaining.</comment>
