<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent emotional depth and consistent motivation anchored in maternal sacrifice; transformation from timid to bold feels earned but slightly rushed in the final act.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Circular structure with strong thematic cohesion, but pacing stumbles during cosmic hush's rupture; cause/effects for invention's defeat require subtle elaboration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vividly immersive bioluminescent ecosystem transcends typical fantasy tropes; slime molds as living metaphors elevate setting beyond decoration into narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly layered subtext about redemptive truth; some emotional beats (daughter's fate reveal) could use subtler amplification rather than explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original mythopoeic structure avoids genre clich√©s; occasional purple prose passages (e.g., "liquid stars") strain credibility but don't dominate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Masterful thematic fusion of all elements; slight missteps in mechanical plot logic (invention's activation mechanics) don't undermine overall structural integrity.</comment>
