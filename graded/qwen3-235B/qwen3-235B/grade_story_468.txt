<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's curiosity as a motivating force is present but superficial; internal conflicts/motivations lack depth beyond the plot device. Voice remains stylistically consistent but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structural coherence emerges through circular motion (journey-in-journey-out), but the climax-to-resolution transition feels rushed within the tight word count. Pacing balances tension with introspection unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Opulent sensory details (humming dirges, gnarled roots) immerse readers in a mythic atmosphere. The mangrove labyrinth's eerie serenity and spiritual menace are visceral and inseparable from the narrative's psychological undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("ink bled into golden embers") and symbolic objects (ash journals) evoke existential themes. Ending resonates intellectually but risks overshadowing character agency with abstract resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through inventive imagery (e.g., "footprints vanishing heartbeat by heartbeat"), but atmospheric lushness occasionally teeters into poetic excess. Emotional subtext implied rather than over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements blend into a cohesive whole, though the bracelet-as-plot-engine and abrupt journal combustion lean on fantastical convenience. The story’s philosophical punch lingers, but narrative logic feels slightly porous.</comment>
