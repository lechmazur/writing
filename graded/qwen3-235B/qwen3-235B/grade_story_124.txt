<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's skittishness is contextualized through sensory details, but her emotional transformation feels slightly rushed. The motivation to reconcile with "grace" is hinted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from arrival to resolution, but the leap from dancing to system repair relies partly on poetic abstraction. Pacing avoids feeling rushed due to strong momentum.</comment>
