<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivations as a selfless musician are consistent (her sacrifice aligns with her role), but her interiority is thin; her resolve has no visible inner conflict or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (ship’s failing engine → Lyra’s intervention → sacrifice → resolution), but pacing leans heavily on poetic compression rather than earned emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The salvaged spaceship and wind chime frequencies create a haunting, immersive atmosphere; every sensory detail reinforces the themes of decay and memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors and symbolic fusion of Lyra’s identity with cosmic forces are striking, but the abstract tone sometimes muffles emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in blending music with cosmic navigation shines, but the self-sacrifice trope and some phrase inertia (“savage grace”) hint at formulaic undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified, resonant whole; the story’s brevity amplifies its mythic tone, though some thematic layers feel underexplored.</comment>
