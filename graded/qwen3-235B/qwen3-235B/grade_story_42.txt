<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but emotional depth remains understated; Elian’s guilt shapes actions well but lacks nuanced internal conflict. Dialogue absence weakens voice definition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a complete arc but pacing fluctuates—exposition is lush while pivotal moments (e.g., skirmish resolution) feel abrupt. Logical cause-effect chains exist but tension could be more sustained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (ozone, ink, turbine whirs) but "resigned exuberance" tonal duality isn’t fully earned. Jade pen/constellation linkage to atmosphere is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (pen as guilt/redeption, ledger as layered truth) are evocative. Ending phrase lingers, but emotional impact is diluted by overly explicit thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details avoid genericness but some phrases ("whirred like restless spirits") border on cliche. Character logic (e.g., raiders shifting from violence to reverence) lacks psychological nuance typical of formulaic AI leaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically layered narrative but slight disjoint remains between guerrilla-style skirmish and ethereal revelation. Lingering question about redemption’s limits elevates impact.</comment>
