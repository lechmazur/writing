<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character development is impressionistic rather than psychological; motivations are implied through symbolic action rather than revealed through humanized behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plotted with poetic logic but lacks a clear middle; the transformation from conflict to revelation feels compressed rather than structured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pervasive sensory immersion elevates the setting into an active participant, with details like "fractured viewports" and "grated metal" enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical density and thematic cohesion are undercut by occasional obscurity; the ending resonates intellectually if not emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by sporadic overwrought phrasing; "shattered glass harmonizing with a supernova" risks aesthetic excess without emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong conceptual unity but strained by the formal constraints; the story leans on lyrical abstraction to mask the brevity-imposed narrative thinness.</comment>
