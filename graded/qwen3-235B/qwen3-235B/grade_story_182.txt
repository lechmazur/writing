<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is thinly sketched; motivations shift abruptly from "quiet hunger" to embracing chaos without sufficient interior exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively but feels compressed—pacing stumbles in the emotional arc's resolution, which appears sudden rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush but inconsistent; sensory details dazzle while the magnetic mountain's symbolic integration remains superficial.</comment>
