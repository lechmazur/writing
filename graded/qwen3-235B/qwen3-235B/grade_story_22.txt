<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s obsession with whispered immortality shapes her actions and voice effectively. Her nuanced motivation contrasts with typical adventure tropes, though her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight but occasionally rushed; artifact tag and chokecherry pie drive the narrative cohesively, though the time-constrained resolution feels slightly compressed, weakening the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with tactile details (pie aroma, static-choked portals) but the "generations of silent watchers" concept remains underutilized, diluting the time-spanning thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (grace as flaw, dismantling as pruning) resonate deeply. Dialogue is sparse but impactful. Ending’s philosophical twist elevates the narrative beyond genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original interpretation of "harvesting grace" avoids cliché. Occasional over-ornate phrases ("static of collapsed timelines") risk pretension but mostly succeed in building mystique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements synergize seamlessly; the story’s brevity amplifies thematic focus. Lingering questions about the watchers and artifact’s legacy invite reflection, fulfilling high literary standards.</comment>
