<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Calla's guilt is central but lacks nuanced internal exploration; motivations are emotionally resonant but occasionally simplistic in their symbolic parallels to the sailors' history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through layered discoveries, but the resolution feels slightly rushed; thematic symmetry between past/present is clear but could deepen cause-effect ties between Calla's choices and narrative outcomes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in the wreck's decay and oceanic tension; "manic clarity" manifests evocatively through juxtaposed rituals (coffee/diving) and tactile details, though some metaphors (e.g., kelp as lace) border on familiar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emotional heft emerges through metaphor (ring, knots) and lyrical restraint; ending's didacticism slightly undermines subtler themes of collective truth, and the "equalizing force" risks abstraction over visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes; decoding diaries via crochet knots is inventively tactile. Language balances precision and poeticism without excess; subtext (e.g., guilt's duality) unfolds organically, though the captain's mutiny lore leans slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around shared culpability/resilience, with the blanket's knots and ring as standout unifying devices; the concise arc feels intentional, though the final act's tonal shift to serenity lacks full emotional earnedness.</comment>
