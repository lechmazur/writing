<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's actions align with motivation, but emotional depth feels surface-level. Use of "unjustly fair" and alchemical skills define her well enough, but inner conflict lacks nuance in such a tight space. Dialogue minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing is brisk but effective. Morse code signal propels the plot, cause-effect clear. Ending ties to beginning with resumed butterfly migration. Some compression of antagonist's motivation weakens tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush yet precise: brass railings, bioluminescent patterns, groaning submarine. Sensory details (smoke, heat) ground the fantastical elements. Setting drives tone and action seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (love as lullaby, love as verb) resonate. Subtext of institutional betrayal vs. organic resilience. Ending transcends plot to deliver theme. Dialogue sparse but loaded, e.g., "madness, like fairness."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Largely avoids cliche; steampunk elements refreshed by abyssal setting. Only occasional phrase ("fragile, furious light") strains for effect. Emotional arc shown through actions (smoking gloves, jamming pen), not stated. Invented terminology (leviathan repellent) feels cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Each element interlocks: setting justifies pen's function; love motif underpins both butterflies and rivalry. Tight space feels deliberate, climax satisfying. Leaves lingering questions about ethics of control vs. natural order.</comment>
