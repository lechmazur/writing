<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character has memorable traits but motivation (accidental mayoralty causing guilt) feels underdeveloped, especially given rapid transformation of his perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but resolution feels rushed and contrived - too many questions (why monks hid, how beetle works) left unexplored within tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details establish swamp and carnival atmosphere, but the relationship between elements (monks, mayor, swamp) feels underexplored for full cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses some effective metaphors and imagery, but deeper theme of "listening rather than ruling" isn't sufficiently woven through the narrative for literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines genre elements with some originality but contains familiar fantasy tropes without strong subversion; occasionally slips into ornate descriptions over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story functions but feels constrained rather than enhanced by brevity; integration of elements is competent but lacks the distinctive authorial voice for top-tier publication.</comment>
