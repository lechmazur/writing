<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but 'reincarnated' feels metaphorical rather than literal. Dr. Chen’s sudden redemption seems undermotivated. Guilt is consistent but underdeveloped as a lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weather as plot device is predictable but effective. Resolution feels compressed; the toy soldier’s symbolic role isn't fully crystallized. Structure balances compactness and catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dusty, liminal archive space mirrors Marcus’s stagnation. Sensory details (cracking spines, aquarium bubbles) immerse effectively. Toy soldier’s visual contrast of brokenness enhances mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subversion of culinary ruin to redemptive purpose resonates. The soldier’s symbolism and metaphor of goldfish circles are poignant. Dialogue sharpness elevates thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some phrases (“arthritic knuckles”) fresh but others (“haunting echo”) generic. Emotional nuance in subtext (e.g., soldier’s missing limb) contrasts with stated guilt. Avoids purple prose but occasionally undersells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fewer jarring elements; themes of brokenness/redemption intertwine. While reincarnation motive is murky, the hospice kitchen twist feels innovative. Lingering reflection on resilience/stagnation lingers.</comment>
