<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weaknesses in character depth and nuance; motivations are clear but motivations and actions lack psychological complexity. Characters function more as symbols than fully realized individuals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; the double-booking device lacks narrative weight. Plot progression relies on exposition over action, and the short-form arc feels truncated rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through synthetic pigments, pulsing walls, and tactile textures. Atmosphere is thematically cohesive, though some metaphors verge on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext elevates the theme of human-machine symbiosis. Emotional resonance is subtle but present; however, dialogue lacks distinct voice and tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through genre hybridization (cyberpunk mysticism), but occasional phrases ("poetry in DNA") feel synthetic. Maintains stylistic coherence despite ambitious tone shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High concept execution with meaningful thematic integration of elements, but suffers from slight conceptual fragmentation. Conceptual ambition slightly outpaces character/emotional depth for full market readiness.</comment>
