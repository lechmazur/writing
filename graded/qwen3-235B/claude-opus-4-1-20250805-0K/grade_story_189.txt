<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Maya's literal interpretation drives her actions, but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes beyond plot-convenient determination. Her "brazen calm" reads as passive stoicism rather than distinctive character trait, with motivations feeling imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A clear arc exists (downstairs revelation/upstairs transformation), but the rushed decoding process and immediate success strain plausibility. The plot leans on mystical exposition rather than earned tension, with cause-effect logic relying heavily on "the dead helped her."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse basement's condensation and spectral electricity create tangible atmosphere, but the water-war timeframe mostly functions as backdrop rather than shaping Maya's actions or the haunting's nature. Sensory details like frost and dial tones enhance mood but lack thematic anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (star maps as "navigation charts from civilizations") and eerie imagery elevate the concept, but overused phrases like "echoed from corroded pipes" undermine originality. The ending's "phone calls from space" riff has clever conceptual heft but simplistic emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality in combining haunted technology with cosmic communication is undercut by familiar tropes (solitary genius decoding ancient wisdom, photogenic amnesia of the dead). The phone booth key's cosmic tuning function avoids cliche, but some atmospheric details (ghostly whispers) feel recycled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but lack thematic synergy. The setting's potential (haunted preservation efforts mirroring Maya's quest) isn't fully exploited. The ending feels more like a conceptual punchline than earned narrative resolution or emotional depth.</comment>
