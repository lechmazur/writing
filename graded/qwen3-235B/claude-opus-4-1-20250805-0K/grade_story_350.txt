<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear, but the emotional depth of Dimitri's connection to his mother's legacy remains underexplored despite the inherited purpose. The puppeteer identity shapes actions but lacks nuanced psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc, but the rapid resolution of hidden theaters and followers feels underdeveloped. The puzzle event as cover device works, though pacing between discovery and transformation tilts rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gothic atmosphere in the temple is strong, with tactile details like dust and moonlight, but lacks visceral sensory immersion beyond visual cues. The haunting tone complements the clandestine legacy but could deepen the mythic undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "symphonies of truth" and marionette shadows resonate thematically. The ending's symbolic weight elevates the narrative, with layered meanings about art-as-resistance creating lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept (puppetry-as-revolution), but character emotional beats occasionally default to exposition over subtext. Avoids most clich√©s but "revolution waiting for the next puppeteer" finale risks overused cyclical struggle tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of elements (dual-purpose gown, stamp album as storytelling device) elevates cohesion. The tight word count strains secondary revelations, but the central metaphor and emotional stakes justify the constraints.</comment>
