<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations are conceptually tied to her past, but internal conflicts lack depth; her scientific recklessness feels consistent but insufficiently humanized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plots moves decisively from rebellion to revelation, but tight pacing leaves connections (e.g., polaroids' mechanics) unexplored; ending resolves thematic tension but feels compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sterile lab contrasted with bioluminescent discoveries creates vivid tension; compass's physicality grounds the surreal elements while enhancing the eerie, obsessive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., DNA constellations) are lyrical yet purposeful; subtext about external vs. internal exploration lingers; ending's thematic circularity elevates impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blends hard science and mysticism with originality; avoids genre tropes but occasionally leans on ornamental phrasing ("forbidden iridescence") that verges on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Impressive thematic cohesion despite constraints; some forced elements (polaroid genetics) weaken plausibility, but poetic precision justifies stylistic choices.</comment>
