<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chen's insecurity and obsession drive the narrative, with motivations clearly tied to his traits. His fear of irrelevance and self-doubt manifest coherently, but the tightly compressed format limits deeper character evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from obsession to epiphany, but the abrupt revelation about "transmissions from the future" feels underdeveloped. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally strains credibility under the story's brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The decaying, claustrophobic headquarters and "simmering future" create an oppressive, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (humming lights, warped glass, bioluminescent pulses) deepen immersion without overwriting. The setting is inseparable from the theme of collapse and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resonant themes of identity, evolution, and sacrifice are conveyed through striking metaphors (glass separation, phantom footsteps). The ending lingers with ambiguity, inviting reflection on the cost of transcendence. However, emotional payoff is slightly diluted by clinical prose in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the twist—the preserved brains as future receivers—but leans on familiar sci-fi tropes (dystopian labs, identity doubles). Prose is stylish without excess, though some phrases ("neural scarring") feel slightly generic. The philosophical subtext elevates it beyond genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements skillfully but prioritizes concept over emotional weight. The brevity enhances tension yet leaves some ideas (e.g., the "symphony of footsteps") feeling underexplored. Concept and setting overshadow character texture in the final impact.</comment>
