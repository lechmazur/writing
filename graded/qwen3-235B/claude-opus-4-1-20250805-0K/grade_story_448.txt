<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is mostly consistent, but Mara's transformation from "rebelliously docile" to decisive leader feels abrupt and underdeveloped. Her distrust is shown through actions but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a classic arc but strains under word constraints. The revelation via seashell feels rushed; the guild's sudden approval via the sewing machine resuming strains plausibility despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (soot texture, rhythmic machine) ground the world, but the magical seashell and mage-engineer backstory strain the atmosphere's cohesion. The landlocked chimney with a seashell lacks explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of machinery-magic parallels and the candlestick's memory motif. The ending's thematic payoff about tradition/innovation works well, though emotional beats could be less declarative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s, but some phrases ("brass candlestick's gleaming promise") border on forced lyricism. The seashell's discovery feels purposeful yet human-like in its creative logic. Tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but occasionally mechanically. The tight integration of the candlestick and seashell elevates the core concept, though the timeframe feels slightly functional rather than organically developed.</comment>
