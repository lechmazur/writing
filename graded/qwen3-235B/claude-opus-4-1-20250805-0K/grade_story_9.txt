<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation through generational wisdom and grief is effective. Sarcastic voice provides differentiation. Panic is shown through actions, but backstory remains underdeveloped despite constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Intricate cause-effect between water rings and locks drives tight plot. Limited space causes slightly rushed resolution, but circular connection between first/last images of water stains and seeds achieves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gritty neon-on-drought aesthetics brilliantly juxtapose artificial promises with ecological collapse. Sand-scorched wood, weeping-stained bar, and electric-humming billboards create sensory-rich dystopia that mirrors character's desperation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor layers (puzzle box=societal complexity, seeds=radical hope) resonate powerfully. Bitter humor masks existential dread without undermining emotional weight. Final image of planting amid lies creates lasting thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts eco-apocalypse tropes with nonviolent resistance of planting seeds rather than grand confrontation. Dialogue avoids speechifying while maintaining poetic precision. Emotional authenticity emerges through physical details rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically into decayed yet hopeful world. Limited word count doesn't feel restrictive but intentional. Lingers in the mind as parable about how small persistent acts might outlast systemic decay.</comment>
