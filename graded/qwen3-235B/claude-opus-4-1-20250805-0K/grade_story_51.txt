<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Characters are emotionally complex but could delve deeper into Marcus's thug past to justify current psyche; Elena's "rationally subjective" trait lacks consistent manifestation in her behavior beyond one line.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrative flows cohesively with a clear beginning (guilt ritual), middle (revelation via new character), and end (burning slat). Pacing is tight but effective within the constraint; the accidental meetings drive tension but could be more tightly integrated with broader theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Garden's sensory details (crackling arcs, hair standing upright) vividly immerse without overloading prose; its role as metaphor for controlled chaos ties to theme but risks overshadowing other elements with excessive symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Uses potent symbolism (burning slat as catharsis) and subtext (child as counterpoint to Marcus's guilt). Ending resonates thematically, though Elena's dialogue occasionally veers toward exposition to deliver themes directly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through the Static Electricity Garden's tactile symbolism and avoids "redemption through suffering" tropes. Writing is purposeful but some phrases ("controlled chaos," "briefly luminous") flirt with poetic abstraction over specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but rely slightly on familiar frameworks (guilt, redemption) made vivid through setting and imagery. The story’s concise structure feels intentional, though deeper exploration of Marcus’s thug identity might have strengthened stakes.</comment>
