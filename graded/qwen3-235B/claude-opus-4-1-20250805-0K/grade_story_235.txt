<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters are richly hinted at but underdeveloped; their complex history and silent communication are compelling but lack depth in explaining their decades of silence and abrupt reconnection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure is coherent with a satisfying circularity, but the emotional climax feels slightly rushed, compressing the 40-year arc into a brief reunion without fully resolving motivations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly evoked (castle, seasons, meteors), but sensory details beyond sight/imagery are underutilized to immerse readers fully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical symbolism (flowers/meteors), layered subtext, and parallel gestures at the end create profound emotional resonance; lacks only a more viscerally disturbing or unconventional twist to reach perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through inventive pairing of natural phenomena with human emotion, but meteor shower symbolism edges toward overused "stars-as-metaphor" tropes despite fresh execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>The story’s elegance lies in how every element serves its poignant theme—no superfluous details—but leaves a lingering slight hollowness in character interiority despite technical mastery.</grade>
