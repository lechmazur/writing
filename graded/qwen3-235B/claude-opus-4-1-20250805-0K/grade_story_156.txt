<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's evolution from confusion to clarity is clear, but her internal reasoning during key shifts feels underdeveloped despite symbolic use of the key. Motivation for embracing the "counterpoint of hearts" lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bus rides drive the narrative progression, but the central action (liberalizing trade) remains abstract until the ending's abrupt pivot. Pacing feels rushed in depicting intellectual epiphany, though the mirrored beginning/end structure works well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline salt walls, artificial skies, and murmurations create an immersive, hauntingly tactile world where texture (literal/figurative) mirrors philosophical conflict. Sensory details like "frozen tears" salt imagery deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("neurons firing"), layered subtext in Mikhail's dialogue, and the "joyfully tragic" tone create intellectual/emotional impact. Ending's thematic synthesis—diplomacy as co-evolution—feels earned through iterative imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through lyrical but precise language ("salt caverns" vs generic underground). The "diplomat's revelation" trope is subverted via biological metaphors rather than romanticized simplicity. Occasional overreliance on adjective clusters slightly muddies emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically: salt's duality mirrors isolation/connection theme, murmurations structure character arc. The ending's "murmuration of economies" concept elevates concept into lasting philosophical inquiry despite tight word count.</comment>
