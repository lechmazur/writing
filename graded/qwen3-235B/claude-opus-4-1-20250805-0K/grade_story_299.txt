<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations around preserving tradition and personal doubt are well-established, but emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level. The "rationally rebellious" trait lacks full integration with concrete actions or inner conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc but struggles with compression. The decision to preserve Henrik's work feels rushed, lacking the gradual tension buildup the theme deserves. Final revelation reads like a summary rather than earned moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chalk cliffs and studios create visual cohesion. Sensory details like "glowing tablets vs. grinding stones" contrast well, but some atmospheric elements (cheerful gloom) remain underexplored. Salt air and amber glow add needed texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber as "preserved fire" symbolism, intergenerational knowledge as both burden and love, and the paradox of preservation-through-incomplete-transmission create meaningful subtext. Ending's thematic resolution rings emotionally authentic despite brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls - metaphors ("cheerful dirge" vs. "salt air") feel original, and emotional nuance (sad smile at inheritance paradox) works through subtext. Some phrasing ("flawed teachers, imperfect students") veers toward didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate more cohesively than most constraint-based fiction. Creates resonant meditation on cultural preservation within word limits. Some components (interconnected paths, timeframe) feel more utilitarian than essential.</comment>
