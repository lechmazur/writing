<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but could use deeper psychological nuance; Marcus' cynicism feels earned, but his transformation into teaching lacks fully realized emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through the confluence event, but the forced three-minute interactions feel compressed; the ending achieves thematic resolution despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere through sensory details and symbolic decay; the observatory’s ruin mirrors the refugees’ desperation, while the orchard’s pending destruction amplifies tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing and clichés; some transitions feel slightly mechanical (e.g., "charred serenity"), but metaphors like drones as "harbingers of mechanized warfare" refresh genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements form a cohesive whole; the compressed structure feels intentional, though the speed-dating trope strains plausibility, slightly undermining emotional resonance.</comment>
