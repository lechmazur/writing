<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited personality depth; motivation felt imposed by external elements rather than organically developed. His "earnestness" lacked behavioral specificity that might have differentiated him from generic hero archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from discovery to resolution, but some key emotional beats felt rushed. Pacing mostly effective for the word count, though transition between realization and planting motivation needed more psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich visual descriptions created strong atmosphere, but integration of setting with character motivation felt slightly forced. Desert/ice contrast worked well, though the aqueduct's significance remained underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clever use of "canvas of life" metaphor and effective imagery showing rather than telling emotions. Ending resonated thematically. Some symbolic elements bordered on familiar territory, but overall execution was strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoided formulaic patterns with the astronomical map's mapping method. Writing style balanced poetic description with clarity. Emotional beats showed rather than stated feelings. No signs of algorithmic writing patterns detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel deliberately chosen but not fully interdependent. Some components (aqueduct, mountain passes) served primarily decorative functions rather than driving narrative or theme in meaningful ways.</comment>
