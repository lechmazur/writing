<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Poor motivation handling; inconsistent character psychology (sudden heroism lacks internal logic), emotional responses often told vs. shown, but core conflict establishes recognizable personality contours.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Exposition-heavy progression; overcompressed cause-effect chains (museum demolition â†’ shell discovery feels implausible), resolution introduces unearned epiphany mechanics; structural strain shows under 500-word limitations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Striking images (shell acoustics, coral key) undercut by uneven symbolic weight; tactile details present but inconsistently applied (phosphorescent blueprints lack sensory specificity); atmospheric elements compete rather than cohere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical scaffolding (hidden truths as architectural layers) elevates concept, but thematic delivery occasionally heavy-handed; emotional beats in final paragraphs show promise despite earlier didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Predictable mythic structure (prophecies, magical antiquities) undermines freshness; purple prose tendencies ("sharp gentleness," "calcium chambers"); character psychology occasionally reduced to conceptual signposts rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as narrative scaffolding but rarely transcend checklisted obligations; conceptual ambition outweighs execution; thought-provoking mechanics undercut by mechanical execution.</comment>
