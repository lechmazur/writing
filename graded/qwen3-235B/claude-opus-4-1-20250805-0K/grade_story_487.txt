<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's docility clashes with his navigating a violent labyrinth; motivation of maternal loss is strong but underexplored; moments like his interaction with the sundew hint at depth, but his transformation lacks emotional buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying bookends but feels compressed—map assembly lacks urgency, baton's bait twist arrives abruptly without prior foreshadowing; pacing stumbles under word count constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lushly immersive sensory details (stench of corpse flower, acidic sundew tendrils) merge with thematic purpose—bark-spreading transformation mirrors the greenhouse's decay/beauty duality. Minor inconsistency in drum solos' Morse code.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtext of language vs. emotion resonates; transformation conclusion earns its emotionality through prior hints of mother's fate; understated "tears streaming down green face" juxtaposes elegiac tone against horror elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Danger of cliché with "man-eating plants," but corpse flower's hybrid mother/monster form subverts expectations; metaphor of emotion-as-language feels fresh but borders on oversimplification; drum solos as Morse code risks contrivance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion undermines itself with scattered execution—treasure map feels mechanically imposed, drum solos are a strained narrative device; central metaphor (language fails, emotion connects) lingers despite structural flaws.</comment>
