<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is richly detailed through history and objects but lacks active evolution; motivations drive observation over action, creating passivity that weakens narrative force.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has poetic cohesion with strong beginning/middle/end parallels but feels slightly static; the circular structure works but pacing lagged slightly in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels with vivid sensory anchors like "methane lakes" and "nebula-light" but lacks auditory/tactile depth; atmosphere consistently supports thematic tone through sparse, precise details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance through metaphorical precision (binary stars as love) and layered subtext; style balances poeticism with purposeful restraint, culminating in a thematically satisfying revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s with specific metaphors (e.g., "dark matter's tender frequency"); however, occasional overuse of "miraculous ordinary" phrasing approaches purple prose while maintaining stylistic coherence.</comment>
