<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but somewhat simplified; Maeve's no-nonsense empathy needs more complex internal conflict, and her dialogue lacks distinctiveness despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight but slightly predictable; the use of stained glass and heartbeat synchronization drive the narrative well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed within the constrained format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>World-building succeeds in atmosphere (ghosts, dollhouse decay) but underdevelops sensory integration (e.g., sounds of the forge, texture of glass); some illogical connections between the timeframe and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance via metaphors (iron veins, collective heartbeat) and subtext about preservation as resistance to erasure; ending effectively ties craft to existential meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending haunting with post-human themes; avoids genre tropes through specific details (Victorian child ghost, cathedral glass). Avoids purple prose but occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction that risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole; brevity works as an asset. Some reliance on familiar concepts (ghosts needing closure) slightly undermines originality but is elevated by the unique framing of "making" as defiance of oblivion.</comment>
