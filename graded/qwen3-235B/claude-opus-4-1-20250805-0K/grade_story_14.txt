<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc of Marcus’ desperation is clear but underexplored; Vega’s tragedy hinted at but remains cryptic. Dialogue reveals key traits but lacks emotional layers. Naivete drives plot but feels more imposed than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compact structure with a haunting circularity. Initial stakes and final cost resonate, but the mechanics of the bargain’s rules and temporal shifts feel underdeveloped. Pacing balances poetic imagery with forward motion, yet key transitions lack emotional heft.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tidal station’s fusion of technology and mysticism is evocative. Sensory details like “flickering electronic prayers” and “seafoam card scattering” create an eerie, liminal atmosphere. Candlelit dinners contrast with sterile monitors, though deeper worldbuilding could amplify tension between organic and mechanical decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., “human currents,” “joy turned inside-out”) strike with visceral immediacy. Theme of transactional hope lingers. Ending avoids sentimentality, choosing existential irony over resolution. Subtextual grief and bargain costs resonate, though Marcus’ inner life remains at arm’s length.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by tropes of “forbidden knowledge” and “Faustian pacts.” Language occasionally veers into melodrama (“stolen years”). Emotional beats like Vega’s laughter-tears are vivid but risk feeling schematic. Midnight lectures as a method of instruction strains credibility despite thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a melancholic parable, though some feel duct-taped (e.g., tidal station’s narrative purpose is under-theorized). The confined length sharpens stakes but leaves thematic richness underexploited. Ending’s philosophical weight sticks, even if its mechanics feel opaque.</comment>
