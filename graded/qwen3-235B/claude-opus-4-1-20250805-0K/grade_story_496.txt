<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Underdeveloped backstory undermines emotional investment despite clear surface-level motivation and symbolic use of cosmic verse as physical transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative compression sacrifices causal clarity; the ambush/conclusion feels preordained rather than earned, with pivotal moments losing tension from rushed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic urban wilderness is richly textured through botanical decay metaphors, though some elements (e.g., jasmine evaporation) strain ecological believability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking conceptual juxtapositions mix with overwritten passages ("mathematics of longing"); occasionally crosses into self-indulgent abstraction but avoids full AI-like repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic layering falters under word count demands; the anthology-ready ending feels artificially assembled from disparate poetic ideas rather than organically earned.</comment>
