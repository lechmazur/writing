<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's profession as scapegoat is conceptually intriguing but lacks emotional depth; motivation for seeking identity beneath masks is implied but underdeveloped through action or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression of decoding symbols through ritualistic calls, but the ending's transcendence feels abrupt, straining coherence within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Cloud city imagery is visually striking but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, failing to fully immerse readers in the setting's emotional or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (washer as lens, city as discarded identity) and layered subtext about self-perception elevate the narrative; emotional impact undercut by abstract resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Language avoids overt clich√©s but risks purple prose with overwrought descriptors ("robustly delicate," "obsessive calm") that occasionally prioritize style over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively for thematic cohesion but lack narrative urgency; the story leans on concept rather than character or plot to carry its philosophical weight.</comment>
