<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are conceptually linked to her actions but internal logic (stage fright as armor) feels underexplored. Trauma-driven defiance lacks psychological depth; relationships remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but key turning point (holy water solution) feels under-established. Resolution adheres to word limits adequately but lacks earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orbital decay and corrupted factory merge beautifully with industrial decay imagery. Sensory details like backward-limbed dolls work, but sound in vacuum treatment strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lies-as-inheritance theme resonates through metaphors (flowers, silence). Subtext about performed vs internalized fear gives emotional weight. Ending's reverse-blooming garden is poetic but slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasionally descends into ornamental phrasing ("defiant hush against vacuum's eternal quiet") but mostly balances lyricism with clarity. Avoids most exorcism tropes through spatial horror elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally interconnected despite format constraints. Leaves lingering emotional residue rather than pure spectacle. Could benefit from more textured secondary worldbuilding.</comment>
