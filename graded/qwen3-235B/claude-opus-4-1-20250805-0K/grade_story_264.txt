<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meridian's rebelliousness and obsession with wonder are clear, but her backstory and personal stakes feel underdeveloped. Her motivation to impress skeptics lacks emotional depth, though her actions align consistently with her "unruly" label and scientific whimsy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tight word limit forces a compressed arc, but the plot's progression feels logical and focused. The cause-effect of electromagnetic interference and projector timing lacks sufficient technical or thematic grounding. The ending satisfies but could deepen the implications of her success.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (phosphorescent stains, stadium interference) and the juxtaposition of alchemy/science create a hauntingly whimsical atmosphere. The tracking station’s decay and cosmic descent harmonize conceptually, though the baseball framework jars subtly with the setting’s ethereal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("sky lowering like a curious cat") and the central theme of wonder vs. cynicism resonate powerfully. The ending’s emotional undercurrents—the universe as a game—are profound. Subtle showing of Meridian’s transformation enhances impact more effectively than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>ELEMENTS ARE COHESIVE BUT OVERDEPENDENT ON SURREAL LOGIC. THE SHORT FORMAT SERVES THE INTIMATE CLIMAX WELL, WHILE THE BASEBALL TIMING AND PROJECTOR METHOD FEEL SLIGHTLY PRECARIOUS. THE FINAL LINE STICKS BUT SOME CONNECTIONS BETWEEN "UNRULY ALCHEMY" AND THE PLOT REMAIN SKATY.</comment>
