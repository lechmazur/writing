<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional arcs lack visceral depth; inherited genetic contracts drive actions but internal conflict remains somewhat abstracted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concise plot arc from inherited servitude to rebellion is compelling; pacing is taut but payoff feels abbreviated. Card-drawing as pivotal action risks feeling procedural.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ethereal plains and postwar irradiated ocean create immersive, haunting atmosphere; sensory details like "ghostly wheat" and "salt-crusted shores" are visceral and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., genetic code as poetry, chaos as freedom) elevate; subtext about control vs. evolution is potent, though some closing lines verge on trite symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through biochemical cards and linguistic seed-control; avoids dystopian clich√©s via lyricism, though occasional phrases ("harsh comfort") lean into familiar emotional shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements merge organically into a cohesive resistance narrative; brevity enhances urgency; the final image of self-directed seeds lingers as a powerful metaphor for autonomy.</comment>
