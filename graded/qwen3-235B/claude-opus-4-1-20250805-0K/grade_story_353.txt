<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Martha is given intriguing traits that inform her actions (baker = patience) but lacks emotional arc; motivations are stated but not fully dramatized through lived experience or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient with clear beginning/middle/end, though some cause-effect sequences (like flower contagion mechanics) are conceptually abstract. Action drives plot effectively within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moody, surreal atmosphere mostly works but underdelivers on sensory specificity; "flour-dusted hands" grounds character while descriptions of garage/time mechanics remain sketchy. Tone fluctuates between mythic and technical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beautifully crafted prose with rich metaphors ("cynically gentle smile," "shadows speak") carries strong subtext about quiet resistance. Subverts time-travel conventions through domestic science.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through unique premise blending baking/time travel, though tyrant trope remains generic. Slightly overwrites certain phrases ("chronological sabotage") but maintains distinct voice throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</comment>Story holds together conceptually with its core paradox (mundane revolutionary), but some elements (garage setting) feel imposed. Leaves intriguing questions about time's mutability but could have greater emotional resonance.</comment>
