<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation tied to loss feels psychologically nuanced, but the trapper remains more symbolic than fully realized through specific behavioral details or interiority. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite poetic descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight circular structure with thematic resolution in the protagonist's pocket carrying both relics of loss and hope. The action of decoding microfilm drives narrative momentum efficiently within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through contradictory sensory juxtapositions - sterile steel vs. organic condensation, cosmic void vs. oceanic relics - creates immersive tension between entropy and hope. Setting doesn't just house the story but actively shapes it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphor clusters ("bleeding data", "weeping pipes") create thematic resonance. Subtext about archival preservation as survival strategy transcends surface sci-fi elements. Pacing maintains emotional engagement without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most sci-fi clich√©s through deliberate anachronisms (film in digital age) and psychological complexity. Some metaphor risks overextension ("black hole of doubt" slightly strained), but overall maintains fresh conceptual framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Story demonstrates tight control over all elements while maintaining emotional authenticity. The compression enhances thematic impact rather than constraining it, leaving lingering questions about memory and legacy that echo the protagonist's journey.</comment>
