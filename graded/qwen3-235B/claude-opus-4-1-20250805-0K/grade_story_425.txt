<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters show clear traits but motivations lack depth; Vera's transformation feels rushed, Kaine's emotional shift lacks sufficient buildup despite effective use of assigned attributes like "morose" and "bored excitement"</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot's central action (restoring tapestry) drives progression effectively, but the sudden resolution of Vera remaining feels abrupt; blackout-to-connection pacing strained within tight constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid imagery of observatory's physicality contrasts well with cosmic themes, but sensory details remain sparse; atmosphere partially compensates for underdeveloped timeframe implications</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of needlework as narrative device; emotional resonance elevated through tactile metaphors, but dialogue remains functional rather than transcendent; ending teeters on sentimental edge</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of celestial cartography and textile arts avoids genre clich√©s; minimal purple prose, though some descriptors ("lavishly austere") border on conceptual abstraction without concrete embodiment</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Element integration mostly cohesive but inconsistent execution; time-pressured restoration arc works conceptually but falters in emotional payoff within restricted scope</comment>
