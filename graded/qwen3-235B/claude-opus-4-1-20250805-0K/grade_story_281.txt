<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth beyond surface traits; transformation feels rushed and underexplored. The dummy's dialogue lacks complexity in motivation, and Marcus's sudden shift from self-serving thief to transformative poet lacks emotional grounding despite his consistent "scorching poise."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but feels compressed. The dummy's supernatural challenge drives the narrative, yet the thematic resolution feels forced by word count constraints. Pacing falters during rapid thematic pivot toward "stealing humanity's lost wonder," which undermines logical cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on "haunted" cliche without fully committing to sensory immersion. Rust-filtered light and greasy floors barely anchor the setting, while the lighthouse's connection to Marcus's internal journey remains superficial. Timeframe device ("between appointments") feels arbitrary rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Concept has resonant themes about artistic transformation, but execution relies on heavy-handed dialogue rather than subtext. The dummy's poetic revelation feels more instructional than naturally emerging from action. Strong central metaphor (stealing poetry) offers some memorability but lacks nuanced emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, the dummy-as-mystical-guide trope feels familiar. Poetic epiphany follows predictable "dark night of the soul" structure. Some fresh metaphors ("scorching poise") exist, but overall feels like polished genre template rather than genuinely innovative work.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; dummy drives most narrative/meaning while other assigned components (lighthouse, appointments) remain decorative. Ambitious thematic scaffolding evident, but execution lacks cohesion between supernatural elements and grounded character psychology.</comment>
