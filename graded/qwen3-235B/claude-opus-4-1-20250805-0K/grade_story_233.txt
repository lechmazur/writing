<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation but lacks depth; transitions from naive to enlightened feel abrupt; voice remains generic rather than distinctively youthful or mystical; emotional stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc from theft to transcendence within constraints; pacing strains credulity (fragment dissolving at precisely the right moment); cause-effect connections are functional but strained by compact scope</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Virtual-physical fusion conceptually rich but sensory details remain intellectualized; vault's dual-nature artifacts feel underdescribed; "distant warmth" atmosphere inconsistently maintained through character perspective shifts</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "quilted reality" offer intriguing ideas but lack narrative embodiment; ending raises philosophical questions without deep emotional engagement; writing style avoids purple prose but sometimes sacrifices depth for clarity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lullaby-to-transcendence trope shows limited innovation; some fresh angles (commercial break surveillance gaps) undercut by conventional "chosen-one" arc; descriptive passages occasionally devolve into generic tech-mysticism hybrids</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements awkwardly welded together rather than organically integrated; excessive explanatory weight placed on 400-word story compresses thematic ambitions beyond healthy narrative structure</comment>
