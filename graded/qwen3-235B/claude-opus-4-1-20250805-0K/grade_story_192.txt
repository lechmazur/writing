<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Potential for depth undercut by underdeveloped sibling dynamic; protagonist's obsession with the past lacks sufficient emotional nuance. Sister's "ruthless kindness" remains surface-level despite promising thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant through-line between digital archaeology and human rediscovery, but pacing sags in middle sections; the discovery-to-revelation arc feels compressed rather than organic, sacrificing momentum for thematic declarations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brilliant collision of antiquity and speculative tech creates immersive cognitive dissonance; bio-integrated architecture descriptions evoke tactile wonder while the living memory phenomenon justifies supernatural elements with pseudo-scientific plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Profound theme resonates through juxtaposition of bioluminescent decay vs. digital perfection; some emotional beats risk sentimentality, but the villa-as-living-archive motif elevates technical wonder into resonant metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh integration of holographic decay with biological memory avoids genre clich√©s; prose occasionally becomes mannered during descriptive flourishes, diminishing the emotional authenticity of crucial revelations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through architectural metaphor, though thematic emphasis occasionally overwhelms character logic; leaves resonant question about memory transmission in digitized societies.</comment>
