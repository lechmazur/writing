<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits pivot from mild curiosity to cosmic obsession without sufficient psychological grounding; emotional shifts feel narratively imposed rather than organically observed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion within its constraints, though the climactic revelation feels preordained rather than earned through structural buildup; pacing occasionally stalls on metaphysical exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the ship graveyard creates a haunting atmosphere, but the connection between Elena's grandmother's historical loss and the present setting lacks visceral contextual anchoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While individual elements (rain tracking, resonance) serve the narrative, the story's brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of its most evocative implications, leaving thematic threads somewhat ethereal.</comment>
