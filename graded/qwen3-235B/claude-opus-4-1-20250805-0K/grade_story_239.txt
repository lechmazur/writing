<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Meridian’s traits are vividly sketched (frenetic, formally imperfect illusions), but her internal drive remains underexplored. Her connection to the lunchbox and defiance of guild rules hint at deeper psychology but lack layered nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The outage-driven revelation is efficient, but the plot’s compression flattens development. Some causality (e.g., neighbors’ sudden phantoms) feels under-contextualized within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tree ring room’s atmosphere is immersive, merging sensory specifics (pulsing sunlight, phosphorescence) with thematic weight. The zephyr and temporal bleed enhance immersion without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (e.g., “radiant shifts”) elevate the prose, while the theme of interwoven personal/historical memory resonates. However, emotional resonance leans on imagery over organic human reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (“wooden library of unspoken histories”) stand out, but some phrases (“history refusing to die”) border on cliché. The fusion of magic and ecological memory feels fresh, though occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion exists, but the plot’s brevity undermines thematic payoff. The ending’s implication of lasting change feels underdeveloped despite poetic resonance.</comment>
