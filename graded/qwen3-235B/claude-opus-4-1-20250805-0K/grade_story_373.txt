<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Weak connection between cybernetic enhancements and professional identity; motivation drives plot but lacks psychological complexity; character serves thematic goals more than possessing independent agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Raised conceptual plotlines without resolution; beginning/end mirror but lack causal progression; conceptual momentum sustained through atmosphere rather than event-based arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually rich, ecocritical atmosphere with sensory specificity; "raucous silence" and chemical horror aesthetics create cohesive uncanny mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical subversion of biological norms through precise metaphor; recursive structure reinforces thematic tension between order/disintegration; ending lingers without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original conceptual fusion of biopunk and naturalism; occasionally overwritten phrases detract, but core metaphors (sacred taboo, question-mark spine) transcend genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements deliberately interwoven to evoke post-human ecology; brevity enhances mythic quality; challenges assumptions without didacticism.</comment>
