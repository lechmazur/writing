<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s sass and academic mischievousness shape her actions, but motivations remain surface-level rebellion without deeper emotional grounding. Voice is distinct but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative has a clear arc, but the tight structure feels rushed—transitions between opening the chest and reality fracturing lack tension. Pacing uneven in middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes bureaucratic sterility with surreal chaos effectively, but sensory details are sparse. Twilight timeframe underutilized beyond vague mood-setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (e.g., "chaos as secret ingredient") and ironic subversion of order vs. creativity. Ending resonates, but some emotions are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, genre-blending premise avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors. Some uneven prose ("grease fire" feels contrived) and predictable rebellious tone undercut originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the story but aren’t flawless: camera and treasure chests stretch plausibility. Conceptual ambition shines, but execution lacks refinement for top-tier polish.</comment>
