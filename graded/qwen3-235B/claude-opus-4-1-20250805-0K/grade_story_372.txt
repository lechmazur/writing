<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually clear but underdeveloped; motivations (lost love, data avalanche) surface without sufficient psychological nuance; Vera's dialogue feels reactive rather than rooted in established traits</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tight pacing maintains urgency but sacrifices clarity; the agency's role remains nebulous, weakening stakes; plot pivots on tech concepts poorly explained; urban exploration method glosses over logistical gaps</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visceral, sensory-rich setting creation (bioluminescent graffiti, chemical runoff) immerses readers; atmospheric details reinforce existential decay; lacks consistent integration with character psychology; "rambling destiny" tonal shifts feel disconnected</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (data avalanche as repressed emotion) reward reflection; ending's symbolic potential elevates impact; inconsistent showing-vs-telling weakens emotional weight; dialogue contains memorable existential musings</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by genre clich√©s; "hollow operative" archetype feels derivative; neural implants/macguffin recipes lack innovation; some overwrought descriptors ("dying heart graffiti"); emotional suppression as sci-fi plot device is overused</comment>
