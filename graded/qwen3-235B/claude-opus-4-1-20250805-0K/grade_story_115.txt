<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but rushed; Mira’s emotional arc feels compressed. The plague doctor mask’s symbolic weight isn’t fully leveraged in her interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but pacing falters—the resolution in the forge feels abrupt. The assigned timeframe ("hours between remorse and forgiveness") isn’t meaningfully integrated into the narrative’s logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting is visually striking (nano-city bioluminescence, shifting Chancellor) but sensory details are inconsistent. The toxic atmosphere’s implications for plot/character are underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphor in "reforging memory" elevates the theme, but emotional beats rely too heavily on explicit statements (e.g., "trust," "apology sequences") rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding leans on genre tropes (nano-civilizations, quantum macguffins). The plague mask and RNA-coded apologies show ingenuity, but shifting-state characters feel derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but unevenly executed. Assigned elements are present but strain the narrative’s cohesion; the metaphorical resolution lacks visceral impact.</comment>
