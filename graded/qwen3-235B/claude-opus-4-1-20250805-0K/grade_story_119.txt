<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation lacks depth; his "unyielding compassion" feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or sacrifices. The astral projection ability is central but insufficiently tied to his psychological makeup, while "sometimes always" is underdeveloped as a defining trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence despite constraints, but tension between astral escape and physical limitations remains underexplored. Some cause-effect gaps exist (e.g., how shadows directly hinder Hollow Ones), and the resolution leans on familiar light-darkness symbolism without deeper innovation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere creates palpable dread through sensory details (whistling voids, refractions on brass) but the carnival setting leans on expected decay tropes. The key's connection to the Hollow Ones lacks metaphysical logic, weakening the world's internal consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("non-sound" of entities, "sun's mercy") elevates the story. The contrast between ethereal and earthbound states offers thematic resonance, though the ending's circularity feels slightly formulaic rather than fully earned through emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subverts astral projection tropes by linking it to survivalist compassion. However, phrases like "mechanical precision" of shadows and "morning bird calls" risk feeling contrived. Emotional beats (protector complex, childhood key memory) are understated but occasionally veer into literary preciousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story struggles with integration of "sometimes always" and precise shadow-tracking mechanics. The carnival's role as both physical and metaphysical battleground works well, but the narrative's metaphysical rules feel selectively applied rather than organically developed within its own logic.</comment>
