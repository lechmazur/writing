<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina’s layered grief and identity struggle are compelling, but her internal conflict could be more viscerally tied to specific details of her work as a diver. Tommy’s motivation feels underexplored despite his thematic importance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure pivots effectively on the letter revelation, but compressed pacing flattens key transitions (e.g., Tommy’s backstory). The ending resonates, yet the haunted carnival’s role in reaching catharsis lacks visceral cause-and-effect buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival evokes decay as emotional metaphor; sensory details (salt corrosion, warped wood) masterfully embed history. The amber’s warmth as a temporal pulse is particularly haunting, though the spectral mechanics remain underexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (frozen resin/unfinished stories) beautifully support the theme of liberation through incompleteness. The ending’s "half-written" philosophy avoids melodrama, though Marina’s emotional thaw could be more subtly dramatized through action rather than abstract insight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Linguistic precision—“dancing with grief,” “amber grew warm”—avoids cliché. Subverts suicide note convention, but “fleeting rebellion” tone borders on thematic redundancy. Occasional lyrical abstraction risks overshadowing concrete character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements creates thematic unity. Each assigned element (e.g., carnival, half-letter) interlocks metaphorically, though the family tradition’s mechanics feel underexplored. The brevity sharpens the story’s philosophical weight without sacrificing resonance.</comment>
