<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unit-7's android nature allows unique expression of nostalgia through "memory banks" and calculations, but emotional motivations remain transactional. The fearlessness manifests primarily as functional problem-solving rather than deep psychological complexity. Dialogue reveals tactical intelligence but lacks human nuance in self-sacrificial reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect chain with tight 500-word economy: telescope observation → crystal fizz → sabotage → reversal. Only minor pacing weakness in compressed 47-year backstory exposition. The "17 seconds" calculation strains plausibility but serves narrative urgency. The arc from surveillance to intervention achieves compact completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublime fusion of high-tech levitation facility and organic crystal growth creates uncanny biomechanical atmosphere. Dawn's light through ventilation shafts brilliantly contrasts artificial/concrete with natural/crystalline. Copper-zinc telescope conversion feels inevitable in this alchemical science setting. Every visual and sensory element reinforces thematic duality between sterile machinery and dangerous organic transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of betrayal as crystalline patterns achieves haunting profundity. Subtext of institutional corruption across generations resonates through mineral accretion imagery. Ending's "nostalgic circuitry" line perfectly encapsulates android existential paradox. Tension shown through precise technical detail rather than emotional tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Detects occasional mechanical phrasing ("humming with nostalgia," "servos remained steady") but generally avoids formulaic transitions. The "microscopic bubbles of compressed spacetime" offers inspired originality. Emotional subtext emerges through calculated actions rather than exposition. Only slight over-reliance on decimal precision percentages betrays algorithmic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock with surgical precision—no superfluous details. The confined length feels artistically necessary rather than restrictive. Concludes not just a crisis but establishes cyclical vigilance theme. Achieves emotional resonance through quiet heroism rather than dramatic histrionics. Would benefit from deeper exploration of android's subjective experience of time.</comment>
