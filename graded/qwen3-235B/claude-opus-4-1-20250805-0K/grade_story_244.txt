<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Characters are well-defined but motivations lack depth; the protagonist’s guilt and quest for redemption feel archetypal rather than uniquely inhabited, though her tense interactions with Kazuki hint at unresolved inner conflict. The reserved boldness is clear but one-note, with little nuanced behavior beyond surface stoicism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is efficient but linear; the mask’s activation functions as both climax and resolution, feeling abrupt. Connections between the dying rosebush, historians, and threshold are implied but underdeveloped. Pacing manages to maintain flow within tight constraints, though the ending risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Neon workshop juxtaposed with ancient mask creates eerie atmospheric contrast, and sensory details (glowing blue hands, shifting carvings) effectively immerse. However, the rosebush’s symbolic role feels half-formed, and the blend of cyberpunk and mystical elements never fully reconciles its dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of guilt-to-purpose transformation resonate through stark imagery and metaphor (neon light dimming as morality shifts). Dialogue is sparse but impactful; the final line delivers philosophical weight without preachiness. However, emotional beats rely heavily on abstraction rather than deeply embodied character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of neon repair work with soul-reckoning mythology feels inventive, as does the subversion of "forgiveness" tropes. Some phrases ("cold iron," "geometric patterns") risk cliché, but the labyrinthine scars and recited names stand as fresh symbols. The story occasionally leans on poetic vagueness to obscure narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Cohesion is strong among core elements (mask, guilt, threshold) but weaker in secondary ones (rosebush’s significance, historians’ role). Conceptual ambition compensates for occasional lack of emotional urgency; the brevity is deliberate but leaves thematic richness under-satiated.</comment>
