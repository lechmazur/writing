<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mayor's agoraphobia is present but underexplored; her abrupt pivot to leaving feels undermotivated despite emotional resonance. The snuffbox and inherited burdens do shape her actions, but internal nuance in transformation is minimal. Voice is distinct but slightly too formal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc compressed into tight word count, but pacing uneven—exposition about family history interrupts narrative momentum. The hidden switch drives the plot effectively, though cause/effect in her decision to act feels slightly forced. Resolution is coherent but thin on earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive; sensory details (crystallized rain, ventilating whispers) enhance tone. The dunes-as-metaphor deepen the theme, but the dome setting could have been more symbolically integrated with the "rhythm of the rain."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (snuffbox, dome) and lyrical imagery. Ending's thematic punch ("destiny is chosen") resonates, but emotional impact would benefit from less telling in interiority. Subtext about isolation vs. connection is clear but lacks complicating layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some stock phrases ("hypnotic patterns," "symphony of nature") border on cliché. Evokes genuine tension between fear and agency but occasionally relies on stated emotions ("dread," "eager resignation"). Subverts isolation trope with the dunes' "prisons built from inside" concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Omits direct character interactions that might deepen cohesion; all elements function but not all reach their thematic potential. Lingering questions about legacy vs. individuality feel intentional, but execution lacks the polish of a top-tier publication.</comment>
