<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minstrel's "openly private" duality is shown through juxtaposed actions, but internal conflict remains underdeveloped. Motivation to escape mediocrity is clear, but transformation feels more symbolic than emotionally earned. Reactions to ladle hint at destiny rather than deep character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc from hidden minstrel to transformation, propelled by ladle's use. Rush-hour pacing contrasts with stillness motif. Some abruptness in giant's approach, but contained word count maintains coherence through spatial-temporal focus on dining room.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gargantuan scale creates visceral contrast through sensory specifics (crystal goblets trembling, humming silverware). Atmosphere merges cosmic strangeness ("meteorite texture") with tactile kitchen details. Setting's oppressive magnitude enhances both plot and theme of liminality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("alien roughness conducting energies") and symbolic layering (crossroads existence) create poetic resonance. Ending's ghost melody provides closure while leaving meta-commentary on artistic purpose. Subtext about hidden power in mundane performers impressively woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unique fusion of cosmic mysticism with domestic epic. Avoids clichés through precise language ("gentle turmoil") but occasionally ventures into ornate abstraction ("peeling away like old paint"). Transitions are smooth rather than formulaic, with emotional undercurrents shown rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into an indivisible whole—the minstrel's lingering (7A) enables using the ladle (7B) in the dining room (7G). All components serve theme: silence (7C) shapes motivation (7I) through cosmic method (7F), while rush hour (7H) contrasts with his stillness (7D) to produce transformative tone (7J).</comment>
