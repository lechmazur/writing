<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains shallow; the hacker's moral conflict feels intellectualized rather than psychologically grounded, with tea ritual serving more as symbolic flourish than meaningful character trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear discovery of historical erasure creates momentum through layered revelations, though the compressed arc relies heavily on exposition dumps; the tea-timed three minutes provide elegant structure but some beats feel compressed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High-tech Rome simulation offers immersive contrasts through sensory details like clinking bronze caps, but lacks olfactory/tactile dimensions; the digital resurrection's flickering quality unintentionally distances readers from historical immediacy.</comment>
