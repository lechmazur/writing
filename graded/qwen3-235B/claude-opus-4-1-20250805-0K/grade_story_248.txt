<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is partially clear but underdeveloped; Kora's transformation from trembling sentinel to decisive actor lacks emotional nuance, and her "coyly furious" moment feels disconnected from her established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but pacing falters—resolution of reassembling letters happens abruptly without showing Kora's analytical process; the revelation about the ark feels rushed despite clever conceptual twist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting creates eerie atmosphere through sensory details (corroded floor, warped freighter), but the abandoned bay’s connection to Kora’s duty and the ark’s significance feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (prophecies as "confetti from a funeral," collision as salvation) elevate the theme; emotional resonance is undercut by occasional overstatement of feelings rather than embodying them through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (subverted prophecy twist) and uses fresh metaphors, but phrases like "cheerless ecstasy" and sudden holographic text resolution hint at formulaic transitions; emotional complexity remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted; the ark twist is ingenious, yet the story’s brevity sacrifices depth in character logic and worldbuilding, making thematic heft feel slightly forced.</comment>
