<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lucia's recognition of her father's traits feels sudden; Marcus's internal conflict is compelling but his backstory as a "calcified" protector lacks sufficient grounding in action. The photo as motivator is effective but over-explained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The exposition-heavy middle drags, but the tight deadline creates urgency. The transition from exposition to escape plan feels abrupt yet purposefully dissonant with Marcus's controlled persona. A clear arc exists within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stark lunar setting contrasts with artificial autumn beautifully. The sensory details of genetically modified trees and recycled air create tangible claustrophobia. Earth's distant blue becomes a potent symbol of lost freedom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen metaphors ("rage like lunar ice") contrast with biological persistence ("roots sharing nutrients"). The story's true power lies in subtext: freedom as a biological imperative rather than abstract ideal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrases feel overworked ("serenity of Marcus's anger"). The "hidden community of dead relatives" strains credibility slightly. Emotional beats primarily shown through deliberate actions rather than stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work together thematically if not always organically. The strict word limit creates necessary compression rather than feeling artificial. The final image of contracts dissolving connects emotionally before technical resolution.</comment>
