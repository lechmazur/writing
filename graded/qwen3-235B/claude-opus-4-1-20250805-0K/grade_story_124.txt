<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's skittishness influences movements and interactions but lacks deeper psychological nuance; motivation partially revealed through objects rather than fully embodied interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through tactile engagement with the loom, but the EM field climax feels abruptly introduced; tight structure compromised by underdeveloped causal links.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lunar setting's sterile aluminum contrasts vividly with organic loom; sensory details (pomade, phosphorescence) immerse but could deepen atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors bridge quantum memory and human grace with precision; ending resonates thematically but risks abstraction over emotional impact; strong craft, slight subtext overtness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality in combining lunar EM fields with weaving, but certain phrases ("subconscious reveals itself through motion") approach clich√©; emotional states occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of elements, but brevity leaves thematic potential unfulfilled; lingering thought evoked, though cohesion slightly strained by ambitious concept integration.</comment>
