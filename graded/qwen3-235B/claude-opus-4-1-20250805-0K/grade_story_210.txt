<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and consistency are clear (scholar seeking validation for lore), but her internal psychology remains underdeveloped, relying on archetypes (the "mad genius") without deeper emotional or intellectual complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing balances evocative descriptions with rising tension, but the transition from crossword revelation to spectral manifestations feels abrupt. The ending resolves the immediate tension but sacrifices narrative momentum for thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory texture: the groaning ship's timbers as memory-carrying entities, the lamp casting anachronistic shadows, and the haunted signal room's "waiting" ambience create an atmosphere where the supernatural feels archaeologically tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "darkness as presence" and the crossword-as-map elevate the narrative. The ending's thematic resonance (exploration as philosophy, not conquest) feels earned, though some phrasing ("humble rebellion") borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through original conceits (ghost ship sailing backward in time), but occasional over-reliance on poetic abstractions ("whispered memory that made the air itself vibrate") and predictable "mad genius" framing undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements like the lighthouse's paradoxical origin and the vibrating timbers are woven cohesively, but the "waiting room" timeframe and "humble rebellion" tone sometimes feel externally imposed rather than organically thematic.</comment>
