<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (finding hidden meanings) is clear, but muteness isn't fully utilized beyond passive pattern recognition; lacks depth in emotional stakes or personal history shaping her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has logical flow (storm setting drives urgency; guide directs action) and satisfying arc, but celestial alignment's role feels underdeveloped despite driving the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly immersive; storm, decayed opera house, and falling snow create a cohesive, haunting mood that perfectly complements interdimensional themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("wordless song") and thematic consistency (silence as key to understanding) create impact. Ending lacks emotional resonance but maintains intellectual coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (muteness-as-magic feels fresh), but some phrases ("thick curtains of snow") and over-reliance on "cold" imagery border on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically (setting informs plot; character traits enable resolution). Short form feels intentional, though emotional layering is thin.</comment>
