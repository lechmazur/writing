<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is partial; regret and redemption are clear but the inventor aspect is underutilized. The character’s "socially awkward" trait lacks depth beyond brief interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (from decryption to revelation) but feels compressed. Motivation-driven progression is logical, though pivotal emotional beats lack room to breathe in the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting creates a moody ambiance, but sensory details are sparse. The diner’s restless energy ties to the tone, yet fails to fully immerse or deepen the character’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (whistle, "tree of regret") and thematic resonance (preservation vs. loss) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but emotional impact remains understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh premise avoids clichés, with layered use of coded correspondence. Some phrases risk slight generic-ness ("restless energy"), but the subversion of cryptography as cultural preservation feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements cohere around the central theme, but some (like "inventor") feel misaligned. The short form enhances focus but leaves thematic threads (regret, legacy) underexplored.</comment>
