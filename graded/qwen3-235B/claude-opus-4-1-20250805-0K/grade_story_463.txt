<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Coldly defined traits (dry wit) are present in dialogue but lack psychological depth or inner conflict. Motivation to learn traditional methods lacks emotional stakes beyond plot convenience. Character remains a spectral outline, not a living entity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Confiscate pivot feels arbitrary; central action (dance) has unclear connection to beginning. Concept of eroding promises shapes theme but not plot mechanics. Pacing stumbles—aestheticized descriptions disrupt narrative momentum in tight word-count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse bedroom's decaying grandeur vividly rendered through tactile details. Salt motif effectively reinforces theme. Atmospheric unease is palpable, though Gothic elements border on cliché without deeper contextualization.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical heft (promise as physical/psychic burden) elevates material. Ending's thematic resonance (release vs. entrapment) lingers. Some abstract statements ("trembling bridge between worlds") veer toward empty lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mix of fresh metaphors ("tongue turned to salt") and shopworn phrases ("frozen blood"). Dance mechanism avoids convention, but spirit interaction leans on spectral trope familiarity. Emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven—each choice serves theme. Length feels purposeful, not constrained. Final image of emptiness-as-possession offers clever inversion but lacks visceral emotional sting.</comment>
