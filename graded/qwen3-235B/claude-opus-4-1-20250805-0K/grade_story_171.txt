<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Obsession drives Marcus, but his emotional arc feels slightly rushed in the word limit; his "ravenous gentleness" is conceptually strong but inconsistently embodied beyond surface descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bootleg recordings resolve the quest logically but the stamp’s hiding place feels under-prepared; the Ferris wheel and carnival’s role in the plot are underutilized, creating minor cohesion gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile details (faded orchard, pedal-powered machinery) create a cohesive atmosphere; the setting’s decay metaphorically mirrors Marcus’s obsession but isn’t fully integrated with his internal journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thematic resonance about obsession vs. wonder is poignant but occasionally stated rather than shown; the ending’s symbolism (returning the stamp) is moving but risks oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés (e.g., bootleg recordings as clues are clever) but relies on predictable redemption tropes; language is lyrical yet occasionally veers into over-adorned prose ("strange, beautiful madness") that dilutes subtler beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>6</grade><comment>Ambitious but uneven—thematic ambition is undercut by rushed pacing; the resolution satisfies emotionally but lacks the technical precision required for top-tier literary acclaim.</comment>
