<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's awkwardness and hesitation are present but thinly integrated into decision-making; motivation to restore systems surfaces abruptly, lacking layered internal conflict</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular structure ties beginning/end well, but symbolic carving feels narratively rushed; cause-effect between memory revelation and action lacks emotional buildup</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Volcanic-ice orchard creates striking atmosphere with concrete sensory details, though geothermal vent mechanics remain underexplained; the setting amplifies thematic contrasts but inconsistently connects to the postcard's function</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric bridge-building and hermit crab parallels create thematic resonance; poetic language risks becoming self-indulgent but generally earns emotional impact through specific imagery like "windows between dimensions"</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids clichés with unconventional science-fantasy elements, but "hesitant swordsman" archetype remains familiar; emotional beats are shown more than told but occasionally softened by abstract phrasing like "ephemeral understanding"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but uneven execution—some (vents, crabs) feel decorative rather than essential; metaphor-heavy style creates lingering thematic questions without delivering full emotional payoff</comment>
