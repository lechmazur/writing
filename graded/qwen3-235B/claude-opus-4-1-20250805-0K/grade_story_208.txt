<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character reactions and motivation tie to themes but lack depth; Marcus is a sympathetic archetype but falls short of profound psychological nuance due to brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but struggles with compression; temporal shifts feel conceptually elegant yet execution leaves some logistical questions unaddressed in the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines mechanical and emotional textures effectively but relies heavily on conceptual abstraction rather than concrete sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegantly weaves multiple layers—regret, time, creativity—through vivid metaphors and thematic cohesion, though emotional impact occasionally sacrifices subtlety for poetic flourish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures with inventive conceits (AI learning through jazz, mail as possibility), though Marcus occasionally veers toward stereotypical "tormented artist" tropes that dilute authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements into a conceptually ambitious narrative; some tension between lyrical prose and narrative economy slightly dampens overall polish.</comment>
