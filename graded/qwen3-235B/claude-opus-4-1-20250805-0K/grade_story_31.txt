<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While characters are distinct with clear traits and motivations, interactions remain simplistic. Emotional depth is hinted at but underdeveloped; Yuki's transition from irritation to insight feels rushed despite functional voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Key finding drives plot but resolution feels compressed. Thematic payoff is clear, yet cause-and-effect (Yuki's system tracing to historical letters) lacks development. Pacing balances momentum and brevity but sacrifices organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Superficial cyberpunk elements (neon sprawl, AR lenses) contrast with the garden metaphor but remain decorative rather than shaping action. Sensory details prioritizing visual motifs over immersive coherence; tone mostly consistent but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overt emotional beats (nostalgia, connection) work effectively within a constrained space. Subtext through objects (AR lenses dimming) and metaphor (natural vs digital) adds depth. Ending delivers thematic resonance despite brief arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Uses tropes (secret stash of sentimental artifacts, tech-child yearning for nature) without subversion. Writing avoids purple prose but leans on expected contrasts (neon vs. green). Revealing hidden letters feels engineered rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenlyâ€”key/letters integration is essential while cyberpunk framing feels optional. Tight length serves the story's modest scale, but thematic weight occasionally strains word limits.</comment>
