<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters have basic motivations (Elena's shame, Syl'theta's ecological crisis) but the lizard keeper remains underdeveloped. Elena's voice has some distinctness but lacks internal complexity despite first-person elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but feels rushed - the epiphany about cosmic photosynthesis appears abruptly. The shortcut as plot device works but the cause-effect momentum feels slightly compressed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visually strong with bioluminescent mathematical fungi and impossible crystalline structures. The enforced truth-telling atmosphere and its narrative consequences are particularly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Excellent use of irony and metaphor ("bitter honey"). The central theme of perception vs reality resonates through both plot mechanics and emotional beats. Subtext about scientific ego versus collaborative truth works powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vocabulary avoids excess ornamentation while maintaining poetic precision. Emotional nuance comes from subtext rather than declarations. The "cosmic radiation" twist avoids clich√© by connecting meteorology to alien botany in a fresh way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve story effectively though not always innovatively - the sextant's role feels purposeful while "colliding interests" remains underexplored. The lizard city's ecological crisis provides meaningful thematic grounding rather than arbitrary worldbuilding.</comment>
