<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Grief as motivator is well-embedded; petals used effectively. Weakness: Gambling instincts underexploited as core trait, character's voice lacks consistency in conveying skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Tight structure within constraints, clear progression from personal grief to rescues to realization. Weakness: Scrawls felt undercontextualized; impound conflict resolved too easily to drive plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Luminescent fungus vs crumbling petals create evocative contrasts; sensory details (dripping water as Elena's voice) masterful. Weakness: Limited development of surface wars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Petal taxonomy as grief metaphor; placebo concept with mushrooms shows subtle thematic layering. Weakness: Emotional arc feels slightly pat; could deepen character subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: Unique marriage of mushrooms/psychic scrawls; avoids overt melodrama. Weakness: Some phrases ("cultivated darkness") border on literary formula; character logic occasionally leans toward conceptual abstraction over human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: Surprising emotional arc; elements coalesce around grief-as-navigation theme. Weakness: Certain mechanical requirements (impound action) feel perfunctory; "frantic peace" concept underdeveloped.</comment>
