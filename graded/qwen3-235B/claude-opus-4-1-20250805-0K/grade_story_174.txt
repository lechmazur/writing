<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mei's regret over leaving her grandmother drives the narrative, but her emotional depth remains subtly implied rather than fully inhabited. The connection between her creative identity and unresolved grief is poignant, yet her internal conflict could benefit from more visceral, specific moments of reckoning beyond reflective epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Structure is elegant: cyclical return to the library, convergence of frost patterns/fireworks, and the firework design as culmination. Pacing is crisp within constraints, though the resolution feels slightly rushed—perhaps one additional beat showing the firework's execution or its immediate emotional impact would enhance the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—auditory (waterfall's roar), tactile (cold glass, paper texture), and visual (doubles in water reflection, frost dendrites) details immerse the reader. The car window juxtaposed with ancient library amplifies the tension between transience and legacy. Atmosphere actively shapes the narrative rather than merely adorning it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (“fireworks in reverse,” “doubles of each spark”) resonate with haunting clarity. The ending’s dual sensory immediacy (launching the firework at dawn) and thematic weight (scattering vs. gathering light) achieve emotional resonance without melodrama. Subtext—art as legacy—is handled with poetic restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No formulaic elements. Frost patterns as nonlinear destiny, the ginkgo leaf’s symbolic specificity, and the library’s tangible history feel inventive. Language remains purposeful—no purple prose—but one or two similes (“branching dendrites that mirrored the veins in her pressed leaves”) border on structural repetition rather than fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate seamlessly: the library’s setting justifies the frost method; the pressed leaves embody her peripatetic journey toward regret-resolution. The brief length feels intentional, compressing time/space to mirror the theme. Ending lingers poetically, though the firework’s launch could be more tactile (sounds, physical sensations) than conceptual.</comment>
