<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation exists but remains externally triggered rather than internally driven; emotions are communicated through poetic abstraction rather than specific behavioral choices or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from discovery through memory to contemplative resolution within constraints, though momentum relies heavily on poetic implication rather than dramatized progression of choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details like constellation patterns and avian patterns create haunting texture, but the Translation Center setting remains conceptually underexploited as a functioning space with operational logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Persistent metaphor of translation-as-intimacy combines with elegiac tone to produce a poignant meditation on human connection, though tension occasionally lacks concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in silent communication lexicon but occasionally undermined by phrasing (e.g., "improbable longing") that skirts clich√© rather than reinventing it; emotional nuance present but sometimes stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story derives compelling theme from element integration but suffers slight conceptual fragmentation; structural economy is impressive, though emotional payoff remains tantalizingly just beyond the narrative's grasp.</comment>
