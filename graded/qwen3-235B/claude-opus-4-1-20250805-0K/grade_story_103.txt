<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the knight's grief is palpable, his characterization leans on archetypal tropes (guilt-ridden warrior, dying daughter) without delving into deeper psychological nuance. The daughter’s agency remains secondary to his emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High tension between truth and illusion drives the plot, but the transition from contemplation to decision feels abrupt. The mirrored moment’s ephemeral nature isn’t fully interrogated, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting merges mythic and intimate spaces effectively: the prison’s decay contrasts the cottage’s warmth. Vivid sensory details (crashing waves, warming stones) anchor both locations in tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (patterned objects as emotional chronology) and tonal balance between hope and despair elevate the narrative. The ending’s thematic resonance—memory as both sanctuary and purgatory—lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through specific imagery (e.g., armor dissolving into mist), but the knight’s "failed father" arc leans on familiar emotional shorthand. Metaphors like the knocker’s "impossible choices" carry fresh weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Every element serves thematic unity: the prison’s false mercy parallels the knight’s denial. The brevity amplifies emotional impact, leaving the reader haunted by the paradox of choosing solace over truth.</comment>
