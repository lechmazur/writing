<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Around-the-corner character beats hint at motivations, but flat dialogue and underexplored backstory prevent Enzo from feeling fully realized. The hatpin relic shows promise but remains superficially symbolic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Holistic momentum exists but feels fragmented—chiaroscuro between intimate moments and exposition undermines emotional weight. The marbles’ pseudo-magical function lacks logical foundation within cyberpunk logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative fragments (chem-fires, wet circuitry) create atmosphere, but the setting remains a generic cyberpunk template rather than a lived-in ecosystem. Sensory details occasionally overshadow internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("tiny sword against darkness") and subtextual themes elevate craftsmanship, but emotional beats are occasionally telegraphed rather than earned. Ending metaphor resonates as thematic counterpoint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marbles-as-hackers’-tool offers ingenuity but strays toward magical realism in a genre requiring gritty plausibility. Some AI-default tendencies surface in overdetermined symbolism rather than organic progression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Functional integration of elements exists, but the story leans on cyberpunk tropes (corporate oppression, tech poverty) rather than transcending them. Lingering question about "human connection" feels half-mined.</comment>
