<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (escaping simulation through music) and consistent, but lacks emotional depth; his identity as grim sentinel isn't fully explored as more than visual description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves linearly through coin-tossing action with logical cause-effect, but struggles with conciseness; resolution feels abrupt despite established tension between programmed repetition and imminent escape.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghost town's decay and liminal dawn atmosphere align with melancholic tone; sensory details (dusty seats, coin's melody) immerse effectively, though slightly reliant on "deserted simulation" tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evokes existential tension through poetic imagery ("dawn bleeding," "code breaking") and subtext about memory as resistance; ending maintains resonant ambiguity but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in music-as-binary-language is strong, but certain phrases ("taste freedom," "breaking code") veer into speculative fiction clich√©s; emotional resonance is shown through imagery but occasionally undercut by abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with elements like music/simulation/memory driving the story; feels purposefully constrained yet meaningful; lacks deeper thematic expansion despite lingering questions about sentience and art's subversive power.</comment>
