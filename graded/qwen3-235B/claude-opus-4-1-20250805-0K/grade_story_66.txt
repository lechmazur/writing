<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack sufficient psychological complexity; transformation feels abstract rather than earned through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Non-linear narrative maintains cohesion through thematic repetition, but the compressed word limit flattens potential dramatic tension; circular structure risks feeling static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially immersive environment merges speculative science with poetic decay; abandoned station's ecosystem creates hauntingly memorable atmosphere through electrified plants and fractured relics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transcendent metaphorical language elevates thematic resonance, particularly in plant trauma parallels; occasional over-reliance on heavy-handed symbolism ("diamonds from carbon") diminishes subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique biopunk elements, but the "redeemed soldier finds peace in nature" arc borders on familiar territory; elevated by precise, non-ornamental prose and fresh botanical metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exemplary synthesis of constraints into thematic architecture; constrained format enhances meditative focus on cyclical patterns; lingers in the mind through conceptual density rather than emotional bombast.</comment>
