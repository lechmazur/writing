<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through cause-effect chains, but the rapid resolution of destabilizing tar pits feels rushed within the brevity constraint, slightly undermining narrative closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting blends suburban decay with mystical elements, but underutilizes sensory details—tar pits and bioluminescence offer some visceral atmosphere but insufficient immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance with alchemical transformation and kinship, but emotional beats occasionally default to exposition rather than full 'showing'; the ending creates thematic payoff but lacks lingering tension.</comment>
