<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Meridian’s motivation as truth-seeker is clear, but her inner life beyond telepathic observation remains underexplored; emotional nuance in her interactions feels sparse despite impactful core actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing is tight and arc coherent despite constraints; connection between Meridian’s awakening and document reveal is logical, though the transition from statue stillness to motion feels slightly rushed, undermining physical stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative details like steam hissing and frost enrich the steampunk aesthetic, but deeper integration of the city’s mechanics with its corruption—beyond set dressing—could strengthen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like “ink on water” and the fixed smile’s transformation resonate; the theme of buried truth gains emotional weight through understated tragedy rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids excessive clichés—living statues and steampunk motifs are rendered with fresh subtext—but occasional phrases (“bronze joints screaming”) veer toward melodrama; emotional subtext is implied but occasionally flattened via abstraction (“tragically joyful” with minimal exploration).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements like the hair tie and music box integrate effectively with the theme, but the steampunk setting and calligraphy angle feel more ornamental than essential to the story’s central conflict.</comment>
