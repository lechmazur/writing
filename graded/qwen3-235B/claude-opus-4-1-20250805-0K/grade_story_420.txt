<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's character is conceptually grounded but lacks emotional depth; her transition feels more symbolic than viscerally human, with motivations implied through abstract themes rather than specific, nuanced actions or desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on poetic logic rather than concrete cause-effect; the transformation of the bones feels abrupt, though the cyclical structure (failed exhibition to triumphant one) maintains coherence within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with fossil texture and light aberrations, but the setting remains staticâ€”dinosaur bones and skylights serve metaphor but lack environmental specificity to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subtle use of metaphor (implosion, ring as lens) and sensory showing over telling elevate the narrative; the ending's thematic resonance and "aha" moment strongly satisfy, though emotional impact remains intellectualized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors (bark-galaxy-lens analogy), avoidance of genre tropes, and layered symbolism avoid formulaic structure; however, the mystical ring-bone interaction borders on vague "art is magic" abstraction.</comment>
