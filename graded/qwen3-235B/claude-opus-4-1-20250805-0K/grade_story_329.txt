<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While Viktor's obsession and emotional stakes are palpable, his backstory remains frustratingly opaque and Chen's xenophobia feels underexplored, creating character depth gaps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Framed by a clear quest, but the tight word limit strains the transition from discovery to thematic resolution, with some narrative beats feeling compressed.</comment>
