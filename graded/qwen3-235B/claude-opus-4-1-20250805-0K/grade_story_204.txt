<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's profession and conflict are well-established but lack nuanced interiority; motivations are clear but not deeply interrogated, relying on thematic resonance over psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical symbolic arc but suffers from compressed pacing; key moments (obtaining the punch, grandmother’s influence) feel underdeveloped, weakening causal momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting’s decayed grandeur and sensory details (rust, silence) masterfully amplify thematic contrasts, though the “cathedral bones” metaphor risks overstated significance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“binary stars,” “miracle of being held”) and thematic cohesion elevate the prose; the final revelation feels earned despite minimal conflict escalation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through surreal object integration and thematic inversion (comfort via spaceport decay); some phrases (“perfumed the air”) border on cliché but are redeemed by tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Elements harmonize into a resonant whole; brevity enhances poetic impact, though the farmer’s market setup and abstract climax marginally undermine narrative grounding.</comment>
