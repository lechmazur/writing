<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are defined by clear motivations (Elias's grief-driven resolve, Sarah's curiosity), but Sarah remains underdeveloped, serving more as a narrative tool than a rounded figure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent emotional arc, but the compressed word count strains structural fluidity; the resolution feels abrupt, undermining the impact of the birds' release.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Richly textured with industrial decay and sensory details (grimy windows, soot-stained streets), though steampunk tropes occasionally blunt its originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mechanical birds as memory, skateboard as talisman) resonate deeply. The ending's thematic punch—revolution through remembrance—transcends the plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through specific imagery (cartoon cat stickers, singing birds), but some phrasing (e.g., "gods of stagnation") edges toward grandiose abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly (skateboard = past innocence; birds = defiance), though the brevity occasionally sacrifices nuance for thematic clarity.</comment>
