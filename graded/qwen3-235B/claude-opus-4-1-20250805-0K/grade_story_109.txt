<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character experiences a believable emotional evolution, though motivations remain underexplored. The "cold-natured" trait feels underutilized beyond surface descriptions, but the revelation about folk remedies adds unexpected depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Compacted structure maintains coherence despite constraints. The mitten's function as both plot device and thematic symbol anchors the narrative, while the sudden transition to emotional awakening feels slightly compressed but acceptable within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through tactile details (crystallized breath, herbs' textures) and visual contrasts between sterile warehouse and intimate altars. The midnight setting at the intersection creates existential dread that resonates with themes of absence and frozen emotional states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor, particularly in framing bureaucratic espionage through religious imagery (altars). The subtext about institutionalized grief-as-art feels profound. Ending lands with quiet emotional power, transforming procedural coldness into poignant humanism through precise symbolic layering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of spy thriller mechanics with poetic symbolism avoids genre clich√©s. Avoids purple prose through disciplined sensory focus. Emotions are shown through curated artifacts rather than stated, though some conceptual explanations risk slight didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work in concert to create a self-contained philosophical meditation. The brief length feels intentionally cinematic. Lingering resonance comes from how absence becomes presence through artistic interpretation, suggesting deeper implications for institutionalized trauma and memory.</comment>
