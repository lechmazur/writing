<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stoicism is core to motivation but depth feels slightly surface. Cameo's connection to past rebellion adds nuance, but internal psychology remains hinted rather than fully embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Modifications drive plot but timeline compression strains believability. The orchard framing bookends effectively, though the brief transformation feels underexplored despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyper-detailed miniatures create chilling uncanny valley effectâ€”perfect for themes. The cameo's tarnished metal and bone-white skull contrast mechanical perfection with humanity's fractures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors sing (museum as ideological prison, cameo as resistance heirloom). The closing lullaby/discord juxtaposition crystallizes the entire narrative's purpose with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some details veer toward preciousness (laudanum bottle feels on-the-nose), but the underground artists' subversion through "uncomfortable truths" in miniatures feels uniquely inventive rather than archetypal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements combine with thematic cohesion but occasionally strain logic. The ending resonates philosophically, though the prosecution consequence feels overly perfunctory.</comment>
