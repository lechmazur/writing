<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are vividly rendered as symbols rather than fully realized beings; Mortis' "consistently strange" trait is explicit but underexplored in emotional depth; grandmother's voice lacks distinct individuality despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc with logical progression; cause-effect ties to sensory triggers are inventive but pacing stumbles during rapid transitions between action and thematic exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent fog, mercury dreams, and cracked mirrors create hallucinatory immersion; some transitions between sensory details feel excessive or disconnected from plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematic density in rituals of rebellion is profound; symbolism (bent ruler becoming a circle) resonates, but emotional weight occasionally relies on poetic abstraction over visceral connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Virtuosity in subverting gothic tropes (spice-infused resurrection, laughter-as-chemical-energy) dazzles; only occasional overwritten passages ("mercury dreams") threaten excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements cohere into a cohesive metaphysical metaphor; constrained length necessitates some abstraction but amplifies the mythic tone rather than limits it.</comment>
