<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hints of depth via parallel between failed orchards and preserved lullabies, but inner turmoil remains sketched rather than psychologically complex. Emotions often stated ("wept") rather than dramatized through action or subtext.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression through acquisition/containment process maintains momentum but lacks narrative tension or substantial complication. Ending circles back skillfully to orchards, though emotional payoff feels predetermined rather than earned through events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visually haunting (bone memory, skeletal branches) but tonal inconsistencies surface—science-fantasy elements like resonance facilities clash against mythic language ("before language existed"). Some motifs (machines translating bone memory) feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor of preserving love through technology, executed via vivid imagery ("synthetic recordings of organic memories"). Over-reliance on portentous abstraction ("liminal hour") occasionally mutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evasion of clichés (desert skulls, dying worlds) through conceptualizing memory as scientific phenomenon. Some overwritten descriptions and emotionally simplistic characterizations prevent reaching higher. Voice distinct but occasionally veers into artificial solemnity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically unified but lacks urgency or revelatory insight about memory/loss. Resonant premise executed competently but stops at melancholic poignancy rather than pushing toward philosophical resonance required for top-tier work.</comment>
