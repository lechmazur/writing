<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to legacy and preservation are clear, but inner conflict and emotional stakes remain underdeveloped. The "overzealous" trait drives actions but lacks psychological nuance or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing balances atmospheric buildup with the supernatural climax, but the abbreviated arc necessitates slight tonal shifts. The beginning establishes methodical tone; the ending resolves the primary quest but sacrifices secondary threads for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shimmering apples, "script underwater") and symbolic setting merge post-apocalyptic decay with mystical purpose. The urban orchard's duality as sacred geometry and abandoned highway creates compelling atmospheric contrasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("absence that had presence") and subtext about memory preservation elevate the narrative. The ending's thematic fusion of documentation and rebellion delivers emotional resonance through precise, layered imagery rather than overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh integration of AI-resistant elements: "sacred geometry as construction work," the goddess's non-form. Some phrases ("familiarly unknown") risk poetic abstraction but remain purposeful. Subtlety in character psychology avoids algorithmic tell-don't-show pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements service the mythopoeic narrative without feeling imposed. The brevity sharpens focus on existential inquiry. Last lines distill thematic power that lingers beyond the confined structure.</comment>
