<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's "jovial" aspect underdeveloped; grief dominates. Motivation and "precariously confident" trait are coherent but lack nuanced emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc and causal logic, but the daughter's departure as resolution feels under-explained, slightly undermining internal consistency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in attic atmosphere, but the setting functions more as mood backdrop than an active force shaping character or plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors and theme are potent, with a philosophically resonant conclusion, though some ideas are stated rather than fully embodied in the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh concept execution with symbolic depth; avoids clichés through rhythmic motifs and acceptance-driven resolution rather than conventional victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Element integration is strong, though some—like "jovial" trait—feel peripheral. Brevity is purposeful, leaving reflective questions but not fully exploiting deeper thematic potential.</comment>
