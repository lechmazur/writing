<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "uncover plant whisperer" and grace in imperfection are surface-level; motivations tied to duty rather than personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses through tight cause-effect (vine’s constriction ➔ workshop collapse), but the word limit truncates emotional and thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting relies on abstract vagueness ("theoretical void," "singularity") over tangible sensory immersion; the workshop feels underexplored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality in blending quantum theory with botanical mysticism; prose is vivid without succumbing to floridity despite poetic density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elegant concept execution, but coherence falters under scrutiny—e.g., "living energy sustaining perpetual motion" lacks logical throughline.</comment>
