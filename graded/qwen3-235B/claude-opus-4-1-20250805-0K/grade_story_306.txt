<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn but depth sacrificed to brevity; motivations are implied rather than fully earned, with past trauma and current quest only thinly interconnected.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot executes clever structure within constraints, but relies on abrupt revelations; the frequency climax feels rushed despite clever thematic bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting's hybrid of scientific and sacred decay creates magnetic atmosphere; sensory details excellent but some elements (vibration chamber) underexplored in favor of more poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and subtext elevates the narrative; ending achieves thematic unity but certain emotional beats could benefit from more gradual build.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept collision (child star-meets-medieval mysticism) but occasional ornate descriptions risk veering toward purple prose without undercutting overall freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sufficient cohesion achieved, but certain elements (vibration chamber, rehab backstory) feel more decorative than essential; the core revelation resonates strongest.</comment>
