<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weak secondary characters and underdeveloped backstory, but Elena's obsessive motivation and conflicting internal logic (scientific rigor vs existential hope) create engaging tension. The surname reveal feels forced rather than organically tied to her psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion in using probability threads to resolve her quest, but the neural interface explanation remains vague. Pacing falters during the seventeen-reality sequence, while the unification's technical specifics feel insufficiently dramatized for the emotional weight demanded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually stunning cosmic setting juxtaposes with Earthbound parking stub tangibility, though the clouds' archive mechanics remain underexplored. The migration's aesthetic grandeur outweighs ecological logic - sensory details privileging sight/sound over tactile experience create worldbuilding imbalance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical resonance between neural migration and corporate inheritance creates thematic vertigo. The inherited burden transformed into active creation elevates this beyond standard cosmic SF. Subtext about fragmented identity manifests through fragmented narrative structure with remarkable economy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids AI-writing tells through precise biological metaphors (data streams as atmospheric currents, memory as ecosystem) and emotional restraint. Subverts corporate exploitation tropes by focusing on ontological transformation rather than simple resistance. Vocabulary serves concept without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Complex layering of legacy and evolution executed with controlled prose and structural audacity. Each assigned element functions as both narrative device and philosophical symbol. The ending's ontological ambition justifies its dramatic license despite minor internal logic gaps.</comment>
