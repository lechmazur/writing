<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on traits abstractly stated rather than revealed through nuanced actions. Motivation for decoding through dance feels conceptually clever but underdeveloped—introversion as armor lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear throughline from decoding to escape, but lacks tension beyond procedural details. Pacing is efficient but feels episodic; the arc ends predictably without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Wasteland atmosphere is evocatively sketched with vivid metaphors ("burnt sugar," "radiation-proof glass"), but lacks sensory layers beyond visuals. Affectionate detachment tone remains more stated than embodied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes and thematic parallels (dance/maths, art/science) create resonance. Ending's metaphor of "long intermission" elevates material but risks pretentiousness; emotional impact remains indirect.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés through original metaphors (e.g., "body's language" for machines). Some phrases ("muscle memory," "mental fortitude") border on abstraction. Originality shines in structure but occasionally falters in emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bundled elements cohere conceptually but unevenly develop themes. Style elevates premise but occasionally obscures deeper human stakes. Conceptual cleverness outpaces psychological authenticity.</comment>
