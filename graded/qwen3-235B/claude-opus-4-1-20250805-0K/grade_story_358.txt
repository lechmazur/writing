<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but lack emotional depth; Mordecai's internal conflict between mysticism and science remains underdeveloped, though his role as a bridge between worlds is conceptually strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Compact yet cohesive arc; the riddle's revelation through reflections efficiently propels the plot. Resolution feels inevitable once motifs of warmth vs. preservation are established, though the abrupt transition through the mirror sacrifices some pacing nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful atmospheric fusion of frost and fever-dream tropicality; sensory details (e.g., wilting ferns, cracking ice on orchid petals) create visceral immersion. The haunted greenhouse setting amplifies existential tension between preservation and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical style elevates the haunting central metaphor of warmth as a currency of transition. Some ideas lean on mystical vagueness rather than earned resonance, but recurring mirror imagery and the thematic interplay of Eternity and ephemerality linger powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking juxtapositions (scientific rigor vs. ancient magic, tropical vs. polar, life vs. preservation) elevate originality. Occasional purple prose ("frost spread across his robes") and reliance on "sanctified dread" without earned emotional weight prevent perfection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story transcends gimmickry through its potent central symbolâ€”temperature as portal. While some connections (playground time's relevance) remain underexplained, the final image of the abandoned coffin fragment haunts with existential implications about legacy and sacrifice.</comment>
