<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's cyber-templar identity shapes actions but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear but feels more thematic than personal, relying on conceptual weight over psychological realism. The collision with reality lacks visceral stakes due to underdeveloped interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong forward momentum exists, but the plot feels compressed; refraction method works cleverly within genre logic yet resolution feels abrupt. Some cause-effect (e.g., bridle’s destruction) lacks buildup, hurting narrative finality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (ice crystals, collapsing horse, screaming vultures) create haunting atmosphere. Tibetan setting is evocative and thematically intertwined with themes of transition between physical/digital realms, though cultural context remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor (photonic threads as techno-spiritual bridge, storm as existential threat) and subtextual themes about perception/sacred spaces elevate impact. Ending resonates conceptually but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of tech/spiritual elements counters genre clichés, but phrases like "neural implants thrummed" verge on technobabble. Some ideas (reality as code) risk feeling derivative despite clever execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements cohesively but prioritizes idea over narrative depth; brevity serves the concept yet limits organic development. Themes linger, but emotional immediacy and character complexity suffer.</comment>
