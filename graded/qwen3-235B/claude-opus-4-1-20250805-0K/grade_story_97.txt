<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation is conceptually clear but lacks depth in emotional evolution; motivations are stated more than demonstrated through action; voice has a distinct tone but could use more idiosyncratic phrasing to ground the cosmic setting in individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure follows a logical arc but feels compressed; plot momentum is sometimes undercut by explanatory interludes; resolution is emotionally satisfying within the word limit but conceptually underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid imagery but suffers from uneven sensory detail—visual flair dominates while emotional weight is unevenly distributed; some elements (floating libraries) feel conceptually indulgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Successfully uses metaphor (compass/heart) and layered meaning, though emotional resonance is occasionally undermined by overt thematic statements; ending achieves thematic cohesion but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the heartbreak-to-vision conceit is inventive, phrases like "optimistic desperation" border on cliché; emotional nuance is often present but occasionally filtered through overly ornate description rather than earned character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but occasionally feel checklist-driven; some aspects (time-shimmer concept) create momentum while others (architects' conference room) feel inserted rather than organically grown; thematic coherence is mostly maintained.</comment>
