<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marienne's motivation is clear but her emotional depth remains underexplored. While her defiance and grief shape her actions, nuance in her psychological journey is minimal despite surface-level coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression from postcard instructions to rebellion, but the compressed format flattens development. The arc feels abrupt rather than earned, with the ending resolving the conflict too tidily for a story framed as cosmic insurrection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative, cohesive atmosphere blends decay and rebirth through tactile details—rust-eaten tools, fog forgotten by the sun, laughing anvil. Sensory specifics create a vivid, oppressive yet whimsical setting that permeates every element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (gardening as rebellion) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The subversion of divine cruelty through absurdity has thematic power, though the ending leans slightly on thematic repetition rather than resonant closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (ink shifting from copper to starlight, tomatoes ripening backward) avoids clichés. Tone balances irony and pathos without drifting into parody, with no mechanical phrasing or emotional shorthand undermining the surreal logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clever integration of elements (gods, fog, postcards) serves the theme of subversive hope. Limited word count works for brevity but sacrifices deeper exploration of the divine conflict. Lingering resonance comes from tonal audacity, not narrative depth.</comment>
