<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's scars and past failure in Belgrade inform his guarded purpose, but internal conflict between vigilance and disgruntlement remains underdeveloped. Emotion is shown through coin imagery rather than deeper human interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight arc through the discovery of microfilm, but the shadow-pattern identification feels abrupt. The transition from stillness to activation lacks grounding, creating a slight structural jolt despite overall coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with tactile coin details and spectral Cold War remnants. Occasional overreliance on metaphor ("iron curtains") detracts; shadows and tunnels immerse but could better engage senses beyond sight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "scars as maps" resonate with haunting beauty. Ending avoids sentimentality, offering thematic payoff about legacy. Subtext of historical erasure and memory elevates narrative beyond genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cold-war-era nuance avoids clich√©; microfilm as plot engine feels purposeful rather than contrived. No excessive flourish or logical gaps. Emotional subtext operates through coins and shadows without overt declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around historical debt and silent guardianship. The brevity amplifies mystery but slightly strains exposition. Final line offers lingering conceptual weight that transcends plot specifics.</comment>
