<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters are sketched with atmospheric texture but lack fully realized interiority; motivations hinge too heavily on reductive romantic nostalgia without exploring how past trauma shapes present actions; aloofness of Marcus remains surface-level rather than informing his professional or interpersonal choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Pacing and imagery are controlled, but structural coherence falters—beginning feels urgent while ending resolves too abstractly to provide narrative closure or emotional payoff despite the tight word limit; key action of "dual mapping" lacks tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Neon-lit mall setting is vivid yet thinly conceptualized—the bioluminescent advertisements and "breathing walls" feel like aesthetic window-dressing rather than spaces where memory, mapping, and human fracture could organically intersect; insufficient sensory layering beyond visual spectacle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor clusters (water, mapping, fractured objects) demonstrate disciplined craftsmanship, but the poignancy of parallel lives feels predetermined rather than earned; quieter moments of tension between "solitary work" and shared history carry more weight than overt thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally prioritizes lyrical abstraction over emotional specificity; avoids purple prose but some phrases ("desperate acceptance," "language of the soul") border on cliché; the ceramic tile and quantum mapping concepts show creativity, yet melancholy risks feeling algorithmically calibrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly—tile and crossroads metaphors work best; "eager resignation" feels artificially imposed rather than organically observed; brevity highlights craft over substance, with themes resonating faintly rather than echoing post-reading.</comment>
