<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts abruptly from aurora-chasing to sacrificial compassion without sufficient emotional groundwork. The wizard's voice lacks individuality beyond poetic abstraction, and her "self-taught" trait has negligible impact on decision-making. The teddy bear's significance is felt but poorly contextualized within her psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing oscillates between rushed (motivation shift) and deliberate (action sequences). The "ricochet" action and cosmic warnings provide tension, but the story's arc relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than character-driven stakes. The ending satisfies thematically but lacks narrative resolution for the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>VR archive setting is richly textured but unevenly focused—crystalline data structures and aurora patterns create visual cohesion, while "load cycles" and "alien frequencies" feel like jargon. Sensory details emphasize sight/sound but neglect touch/taste/smell, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The metaphor of the teddy bear as a soul-container offers symbolic resonance. The interplay between "elegant chaos" and the wizard's movements is conceptually strong, and the theme of salvaging memory through compassion lingers. However, emotional impact feels filtered through poetic language rather than visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Creative use of quantum-stitched seams and temporal instability contrasts with occasional clichéd phrases ("dissolving into pure intention"). The fusion of digital souls and VR spirituality feels fresh but risks over-intellectualizing grief. The wizard's sacrifice has emotional weight without melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story succeeds as speculative poetry but struggles as narrative. Assigned elements cohere intellectually yet strain under scrutiny (e.g., why a teddy bear?). The VR logic has gaps, but the bridge-between-realms metaphor offers lingering philosophical resonance.</comment>
