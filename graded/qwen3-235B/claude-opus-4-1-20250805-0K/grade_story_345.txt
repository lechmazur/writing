<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is philosophical but lacks visceral grounding; motivation is implied rather than demonstrated through action. Archetypal struggles overshadow individual specificity. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a spiritual awakening arc but relies on abstract revelations rather than concrete action. Pacing balances introspection with movement, though the ending feels predetermined rather than earned. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting merges myth and math; snow's upward fall and decaying abacus create haunting texture. Overly reliant on adjective-laden descriptions that occasionally diffuse tension. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (missing beads=imperfect faith) resonate through rich imagery. Ending's existential acceptance avoids preachiness, prioritizing ambiguity. Subtext elevates the narrative beyond allegory. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction that distances the reader. Sensory details are vivid but unevenly weighted; some phrases feel precious rather than purposeful. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under narrative brevity. The abacus and labyrinth function symbolically but lack mechanical logic. Leaves questions, not all productive. </comment>
