<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with Marcus's transformation from rigid observer to active participant well-motivated by the memory-moss revelation. However, Elara's backstory remains under-explored despite her established emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc within tight constraints, but the sudden introduction of cemetery copper-based battery strains plausibility. Connections between memory-moss discovery and resolution feel rushed despite effective emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through vivid sensory details (lavender wax, midnight blooms) and a haunting tone. The greenhouse's physical connection to the cemetery enhances thematic resonance, though some magical logic requires deeper explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling shines through poetic metaphors ("roots and copper wire intertwining") and layered subtext about emotional transformation.
