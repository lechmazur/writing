<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (quiet resistance as legacy) and method (small sabotages) are coherent. Subtle voice through third-person, but some depth sacrificed to brevity. Grandfather’s comic as emotional anchor works well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plottine’s tight pacing and arc (from solitary sabotage to communal resistance) is effective. Beginning/end cohesion strong, though resolution feels slightly rushed despite fitting word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Quantum foam setting is vivid but underutilized beyond superficial tech jargon. Atmosphere balances optimism and tension, though sensory details feel minimal—more synesthetic choices could have deepened immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Potent metaphor usage (desert sands, dance of generations) elevates the narrative. Emotional resonance emerges through subtext over exposition, ending balances closure and lingering implications masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by focusing on collective resistance rather than heroism. No purple prose; metaphors are fresh but occasionally risk abstraction. Subtext feels human rather than formulaic, though some minor tonal rigidity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive fusion of elements creates a resonant whole. Story’s constraints feel purposeful (precision required for its themes), leaving a lingering emotional and philosophical impression beyond the surface plot.</comment>
