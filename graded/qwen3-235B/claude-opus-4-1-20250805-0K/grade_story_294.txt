<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character is symbolic rather than fully realized; motivation and self-transformation resonant but lack psychological complexity; internal reactions shown through poetic gestures but lack visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression with clear arc but compressed emotional development; resolution feels poetically inevitable despite tight space; cause-effect is logical but pacing slightly hurried in internal monologue sections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative fungal decay parallels thematic metamorphosis; sensory details like bioluminescent spores and cool glass amplify mood; occasionally risks atmospheric overkill but maintains symbolic coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical yet precise metaphor work (prism/refractions/doubt-as-cocoon); subtext about constructing identity from fragmented memories resonates; some poetic abstraction risks distancing emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in prism-as-voicemail-conduit concept; avoids genre tropes but occasionally lapses into decorative similes ("ash in mouth"); emotional depth shown through transformative realization rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified philosophical parable; metaphoric logic consistent; minor instances of thematic on-the-nose-ness ("chrysalis") but overall maintains poetic subtlety.</comment>
