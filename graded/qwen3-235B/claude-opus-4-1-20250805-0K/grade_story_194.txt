<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Promises of complexity undercut by underdeveloped motivations; Mara's dual nature is intriguing but lacks emotional grounding, making her transformation feel abrupt despite resonant imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot mechanics are cleverly intertwined, but the resolution's philosophical weight strains credibility within tight word count; cause-effect between letter, nightmares, and revelation lacks sufficient connective tissue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually striking fusion of morbid and culinary elements creates memorable atmosphere, though deeper exploration of timelessness in L'Ossuaire and sensory immersion would elevate the worldbuilding beyond aesthetic shock value.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism elevates the narrative—bones as repositories of knowledge, shattered garnishes mirroring fractured identity—but the ending's thematic weight feels slightly attenuated in execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional conceptual overreach; some metaphors (e.g., "tears cutting channels through flour dust") verge on mannered, and the duality trope avoids cliche through specificity but occasionally sacrifices narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fundamentally cohesive despite compressed scope; the story's thematic engine powers through structural constraints, leaving a lingering tension between ambition and execution that feels intentional rather than flawed.</comment>
