<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dr. Collective's hive-mind nature is conceptually intriguing but lacks emotional depth; Torres's trauma is implied but too abstractly rendered. Their motivations (integration/reality anchoring) are clear but underdeveloped through specific behavioral nuances or compelling internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plot advances through sparse dialogue, creating a sense of contained arc, but pivotal moments (Chen's accident, temporal training) feel narratively distant. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally sluggish, with underexplored cause-effect between wax patterns and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through tactile details (dripping wax, broken prongs) and the facility's paradoxical mission. The temporal training's psychological toll is evocatively hinted, though the setting's full scope remains frustratingly opaque rather than intentionally mysterious.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ghosts of metaphor (wax as time/identity, static as regret) resonate intellectually, but emotional engagement falters. The ending's cyclical question/exclamation mark is clever but feels gimmicky. Dialogue is sharp but occasionally overwritten; tension between determinism and agency is subtext-rich yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combines speculative ideas deftly (hive-minds, pre-regret static), avoiding obvious tropes. Some phrasing ("symphony of choices unmade") risks pretension. Characters display humanlike contradictions without mechanistic cadence, but emotional beats occasionally default to abstract generalities over lived specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>ELEMENTS ARE INTEGRATED BUT UNBALANCED. The wax-coding system and temporal espionage framework exhibit creativity, but the story feels like a proof-of-concept draft. Lingering questions about Chen's fate and the wax's predictive power are intriguing yet under-resolved within the word constraints.</comment>
