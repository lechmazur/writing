<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but lack emotional depth; the femme fatale archetype remains stylized rather than deeply human, with dialogue insufficiently distinct to fully realize her as a unique voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within constraints but lacks a complete arc; the client’s resolution feels abrupt, and the focus on static atmosphere over action weakens forward momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich, imaginative sensory details (mercury pool, cloud trails) create vivid atmosphere, but the setting’s relationship to character psychology and narrative stakes remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (cage of illusions, gravity of desires) elevate the story, but emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on abstract phrasing rather than specific, grounded character struggles.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through inventive time-travel mechanics and layered themes; however, "smile that destroyed emperors" and similar phrases flirt with purple prose, slightly diluting originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Strong conceptual cohesion between elements (time-travel, heartbreak) but unevenly realized; the brevity feels limiting rather than intentional, lacking deeper exploration of its most provocative ideas.</grade>
