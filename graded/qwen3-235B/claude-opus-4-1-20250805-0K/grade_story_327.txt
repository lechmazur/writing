<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emi’s restlessness drives her arrival but is secondary to her transformation; motivation to claim Yuki’s legacy is clear but under-explored psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and cohesive, though pacing falters in the leap from confrontation to lesson; the detour’s thematic payoff justifies its inclusion but feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric with tactile details (water, limestone) but underutilizes the diving school’s uniqueness; tranquility contrasts with Emi’s tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous pearls, the shifting card, and the reflection motif create potent symbolism; subtext about learning as self-discovery elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No formulaic elements; metaphors are original (e.g., emptiness as wisdom), and emotional stakes emerge through actions/imagery rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exquisite integration of assigned elements into a thematically rich narrative; concise yet resonant, leaving questions about legacy and perception.</comment>
