<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slightly undercut by abrupt emotional shifts. Mira's transformation is dramatized but lacks incremental development. The sharpener ties her to the father effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a compressed arc, but the karaoke duet feels contrived despite serving the materialization. The chalk lines' thematic payoff is earned, though the 500-word structure leaves some beats underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sand-streams and blithe discontent, but sensory details skew heavily toward sight/sound. The hourglass's paradoxical sanctuary/prison duality is under-explored through tactile/olfactory avenues.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling achieves emotional resonance through metaphor (hourglass as guardian mechanism) and subtext about sacrificial duty. The ending's thematic fusion of devotion and choice is poignant and layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements are tightly woven despite constraints. The hourglass's logic anchors the narrative, though some components (karaoke method) strain plausibility. Lingers through existential questions about sacrifice.</comment>
