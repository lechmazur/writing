<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is hinted but not fully explored; motivation tied to brewery ownership feels realistic yet underdeveloped, with only superficial exploration of his "uniquely generic" self-perception.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot's descent into darkness follows a clear descent, but the mansion's supernatural rules remain unexplained; the staircase discovery propels action but feels undercontextualized within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details like "blood droplets like breadcrumbs" and oppressive darkness; setting enhances thematic tension but the protest setting's juxtaposition could be more thematically interwoven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in fermentation as existential metaphor; ending's irony resonates, though subtext about artisanship vs. commerce remains surface-level rather than deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original take on corporate vs. artisan struggle intertwined with supernatural horror; some phrases like "seething darkness" verge on clich√©, but the brewery-specific details (hop varieties) feel fresh and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fragments cohere thematically but functional rather than transcendent; the protest-mansion interplay demonstrates cleverness rather than profound thematic unity across compressed form.</comment>
