<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations rooted in mentor-student dynamic and legacy, but depth suffers from brevity and reliance on archetypes. "Hushed" trait is consistent but underexplored beyond volume control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot's cyclical structure (caving session to next day's promise) creates tension between mortality and persistence, but pacing lacks urgency. Conceptual connection between necromancy and mapping is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glowing crystals and moon setting establish vivid sci-fi atmosphere, but Titan's terraformed nature remains surface-level. Sensory details (hum, holograms, cap texture) immerse but insufficiently tie to necromantic themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dialogue's wistful subtext and blending of death/exploitation themes create emotional resonance. Ending's metaphorical use of cave mapping as life purpose elevates narrative beyond surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blends necromancy with space exploration in a way that feels neither derivative nor forced. Avoids "chosen one" tropes by focusing on quiet archival work. Some descriptors (e.g., "ethereal glow") approach conventionality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central metaphor: mapping as dialogue between life/death. Certain aspects (crystalline energy's mechanics, Titan's terraforming logistics) remain unexplored but don't disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
