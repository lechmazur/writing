<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise ties Maria's role as a cook to the conspiracy, but her internal transformation remains underexplored. Her frantic manner explains initial obliviousness but doesn't fully justify her sudden courage. Motivation for risking everything feels implied rather than earned through specific history or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot uses economical structure to create clear arc within constraints: discovery-midpoint-reversal-execution. The subversion method (sabotage via bread compound) is clever and character-appropriate, though the mechanism's technical plausibility stretches suspension of disbelief. Pacing balances revelation pacing with efficient cause/effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Basement kitchen environment skillfully combines domestic details (burnt soups, kneading dough) with institutional elements (industrial oven, hidden history). Eerie contrast between mundane routine and seismic manipulation works well. Limited timeframe scope prevents deeper exploration of "centuries" implication, but dust-impression concept provides effective tactile atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (bread as weaponized truth, dough-folding as secret concealment) enrich narrative. Ending's seismic tremor mirroring personal transformation creates powerful thematic resonance. Some explanatory passages tip toward "telling" but final flour-dusted image successfully "shows" thematic irony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subverts disaster fiction tropes through inversion - earthquakes as orchestrated events. The use of domestic objects (eraser, walking stick) as archival tools feels both original and thematically appropriate. Avoids over-complication through character-driven focus. Sensory details (dust layers, dough texture) feel specific rather than generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Complex interplay between assigned elements creates cohesive whole where each component reinforces theme. The tight 500-word format showcases economic storytelling rather than feeling constrained. The final image of quiet rebellion through culinary sabotage lingers as conceptually rich and thematically complete.</comment>
