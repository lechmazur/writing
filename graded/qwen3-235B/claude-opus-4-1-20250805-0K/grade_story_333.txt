<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is distinct in motivation and voice, but secondary characters lack definition beyond their shared loss. Dialogues hint at deeper grief but don't expand beyond functional exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing balances urgency and revelation, though the transition to the ghosts' purpose feels slightly rushed. The arc of realizing the note's purpose and forming the pact is cohesive within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (breathing walls, cold spots, thunder) create tangible tension. The haunted passage's atmosphere deepens thematic resonance, linking physical setting to emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Symbolism of the mutable note and subversion of 'ghosts as guardians' provoke thematic reflection. Dialogue is functional but lacks lyrical or distinctive rhythm; ending ties theme to action effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Trope-heavy premise (banned traditions, Council as antagonist) is elevated by the shifting note's originality. Emotions occasionally veer into stated rather than shown territory; avoids consistent purple prose but falters in moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements like the storms and sticky note's function are tightly woven, creating layered meaning. The brevity sharpens focus but slightly underdevelops secondary characters' arcs.</comment>
