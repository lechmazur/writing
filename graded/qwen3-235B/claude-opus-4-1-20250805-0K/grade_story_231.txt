<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (justice via spontaneity) drives action, but emotional depth feels surface-level; inner conflict summarized rather than dramatized through specific memories or interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains momentum toward confrontation, but the critical coordinates device disappears after setup; resolution hinges on deus ex machina crowd reaction rather than character-driven logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid visual elements (lapis walls, turquoise inlay) create atmosphere but cultural authenticity feels shallow; lacks distinct sensory details beyond surface-level Sumerian allusions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic weight about justice/chaos resonates; striking metaphors ("order an illusion") elevate impact. Over-reliance on explicit thematic statements slightly undermines subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but employs familiar rebellion-against-tyranny framework; prose veers toward ornate descriptions ("serpent scales" for robes); emotional subtext implied through actions rather than blunt declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements combine cohesively enough for narrative momentum, but the story’s brevity prevents full thematic excavation; memorable closing image balances uneven execution of earlier components.</comment>
