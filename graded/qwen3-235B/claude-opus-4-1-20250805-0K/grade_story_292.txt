<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between duty and legacy is clear, but other characters are thinly sketched. The "hesitant raider" motivation works, though secondary figures like Ruby lack depth despite pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Limited space manages a complete arc through symbolic actions (ash dispersal, journal reveal) and tension resolution. Pacing balances exposition and emotional beats effectively, though some transitions (e.g., Ruby retrieving the journal) feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Speakeasy's sensory details (amber light, creaking stairs) evoke ambiance, but the midnight framework feels more like a setting trope than an integral temporal choice. Atmosphere supports theme but lacks deeper texture—scents of stale beer, warmth of bodies, etc., are minimal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elegantly layered with metaphor (shards of past as literal/symbolic artifacts). Themes of preservation vs. destruction resonate through nuanced dialogue and ritualistic action. Ending resonates as thematic payoff, though emotional beats occasionally border on overtelling ("restless trust").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blends genre expectations with emotional subversion. Avoids cliché through specific historical parallels and moral ambiguity. Some phrases ("DNA of the place") risk modern abstraction, but overall maintains voice and earned emotional stakes without artificial pyrotechnics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements feel organically woven into character-driven stakes rather than imposed. Brevity sharpens focus on legacy and identity, with each component serving larger themes. The closing image lingers as a haunting metaphor for cyclical history.</comment>
