<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is sharply defined through contradictions (elegance in brutality, precision in chaos) but lacks deep psychological complexity beyond surface quirks. Motivation for "terrible beauty" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Compact structure uses tight cause-effect (consultation → execution → funeral) but feels compressed; lacks narrative peaks and valleys. The 500-word arc resolves efficiently without superfluous elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (moss texture, Vivaldi hum, acidic reek) create cohesive, haunting atmosphere. Lantern and shop setting intertwine with character psychology and thematic irony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subtext about performative grief and moral ambiguity lingers. The eulogy device elevates beyond surface thriller through layered irony and ritualized violence as commentary on domestic complacency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids crime genre clichés through juxtaposing baroque details (peacock feathers, bath salts) with mundane evil. Some metaphors (lantern as "terrible beauty") border on overexplanation but generally maintain freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively without strain; the water clock metaphor operates as both setting and thematic device. Short length feels intentional but sacrifices deeper exploration of moral complexity.</comment>
