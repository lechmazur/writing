<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s criminal past and self-reinvention are credible in driving her actions, but her moral complexity remains surface-level. Her shift from fraud to authenticity lacks visceral emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot pivots on the sheet music’s revelation and yodeling performance, with satisfying cause/effect. Pacing compresses timeline effectively but occasionally sacrifices nuance in character shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative details (bamboo, cacao, howler monkeys) ground readers, but the canopy village’s rules feel superficially sketched. The “sustainable cacao” nod to eco-ethics is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor of “tended lies” as life-giving connects to theme. Dialogue is crisp, but emotional beats (her grandmother’s legacy) lean on exposition rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in con artist arcs and eco-utopia tropes. Some phrases (“like tropical rain”) risk purple prose, but the blending of magic/crime is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven with thematic intent, but the abrupt integration of “zip-line generators” and medical clearance lacks thematic payoff. Lingering impact resides in the finale’s paradoxical honesty.</comment>
