<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s shifting loyalties and internal conflict are vividly drawn, with motivation rooted in her "predetermined fate" and physical fragility. Her actions (carving messages, assigning the prisoner) align with her desperation and hope, though secondary characters lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the prisoner’s cipher awareness, creating tension within a tight arc. Pacing is deliberate, but the ending feels abrupt—Marina’s transformation into "guardian of possibilities" lacks gradual buildup despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal island’s liminality mirrors Marina’s state; sensory details (salt-bleached bark, sour phial) immerse readers. Atmosphere fuses with her hopefulness and decay, though the mainland’s description is sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (tides as indecision, bark-carved messages) deepen subtext. The ending avoids closure but resonates thematically. Emotional resonance emerges through understated imagery, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in coded escape via bark carvings; avoids genre tropes. Language is lyrical but precise, with psychological nuance in Marina’s contradictions. Minor redundancy in "wavering" and "tides" repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story coalesces around liminality and cyclical struggle, balancing assigned elements organically. The concise structure feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache for freedom’s tantalizing nearness.</comment>
