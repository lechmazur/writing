<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal rather than fully realized; motivations are conceptually clear but lack psychological complexity or emotional specificity despite cosmic themes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptually satisfying progression to epiphany, but lacks conventional plot mechanics; pacing balanced between poetic stasis and metaphysical culmination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory fusion of decay and multidimensionality creates unforgettable liminal space; atmospheric tension between coldness and shimmering reality-fractures masterfully sustained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</comment>Striking metaphysical metaphors and cosmic paradoxes elevate narrative beyond abstraction; ending achieves thematic resonance through linguistic embodiment of universal language; some over-reliance on conceptual abstraction over emotional engagement.</grade>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</comment>Resists genre tropes through quantum-poetic synthesis; occasional clusters of ornate phrasing ("primal grammar that shaped quarks and quasars") verge on thematic overexplanation; conceptual freshness outweighs rare purple patches.</grade>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</comment>Element integration prioritizes thematic unity over conventional cohesion; brief form utilized effectively for epiphanic compression; some aspects feel more decorative than essential to narrative momentum.</grade>
