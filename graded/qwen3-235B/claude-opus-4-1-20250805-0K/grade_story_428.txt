<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development hinges on transformative moment but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear (dissolution of idealism) but interiority remains aestheticized rather than emotionally urgent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot's tight construction through symbolic architecture falters under scrutiny—handshake deal feels under-earned, historical collapse conflated with personal transformation lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and specific (humidity in stone, monsoon light) yet setting functions more as tableau than active force—civilizational decay remains visual metaphor rather than lived reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linguistic precision elevates the piece; "navigating by absence" resonates thematically, but ending's thematic declaration ("chains reforged as armor") veers toward didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality exists in metaphoric inversion (destruction as revelation) but falters with tropes like "calculated pessimism"; some phrasing ("urgent hands signing desperate contracts") borders on overwrought repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through tone and imagery rather than narrative force; assigned elements function more as conceptual scaffolding than organically integrated components.</comment>
