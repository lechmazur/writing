<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find justice is clear but underdeveloped; Mira’s "gentleness" isn’t distinct from her role as a conjurer. Reactions to the butterfly/garden reveal determination but lack psychological depth or ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from discovery to transformation, but hinges on rapid exposition. The method (reversed messages) logically drives the story, though the ending feels abrupt. Pacing occasionally drags in dense imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie, luminous descriptions of the underground city and garden create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (poisonous vines, laughter-screaming sounds) enrich the setting. Tone of haunting beauty is undercut by underexplored "joyful terror."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (e.g., justice as a bioluminescent garden that "kills or cures") provoke reflection. Subtext about truth’s cost is potent, though themes occasionally verge on didacticism. Ending avoids trite resolution while maintaining emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés in its imagery (e.g., "terrible gift of justice") but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("joyful terror," "terrible delight"). Some emotional beats are stated rather than shown, and transitions between scenes strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted—e.g., the dwarves feel underutilized compared to the butterfly’s centrality. The concise format works for mystery rather than limitation, though some arbitrary details (brittle branch) lack resonance.</comment>
