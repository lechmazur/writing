<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's determination and internal conflict are clear, but the transition from fear to resolution feels slightly compressed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with strong cause-and-effect, but the climax-to-resolution shift could be more gradual for better emotional resonance in the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially rich atmosphere merges effectively with thematic concerns—radioactive bioluminescent orchards mirror internal duality; decay/beauty juxtaposition is visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly layered symbolism (glitter=residue of past self; box=fragile hope) and ironic tone ("merry bitterness") elevate the narrative beyond typical post-apocalyptic arcs for emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most post-apocalyptic clichés through specific details (sequined gowns as lost beauty, sequin residue magic), but the "price of truth" device borders on familiar territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are purposefully fused—no extraneous detail; the interplay between personal/cosmic healing creates thematic resonance that lingers after reading.</comment>
