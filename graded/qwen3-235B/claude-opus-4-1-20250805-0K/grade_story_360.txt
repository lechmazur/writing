<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s meekness is clear but underdeveloped; her shift from denial to clarity about her purpose feels rushed. The broken pen ties to her motivation, but internal conflict lacks nuanced emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pacing struggles in tight word limit: elder’s revelation feels abrupt, and cause-effect between Elara’s past and the tapestry’s meaning needs stronger scaffolding. The ending resolves cleanly but undermines thematic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking contrasts (playful goblins vs. necromantic themes) create unique atmosphere, but inconsistencies in tone—e.g., whimsy clashing with death’s gravity—distract from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry, light/dew) are effective but over-explained; the ending’s "mystic simplicity" leans on familiar spiritualized tropes. Subtext about interconnectedness is touching but not deeply interrogated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends unexpected elements (goblins, pen, necromancy), but some sensory details (e.g., "moss-covered swings") feel generic. The dewdrop method and tapestry metaphor verge on AI-generated grandiosity without enough contextual grit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel modular rather than seamlessly interdependent. The theme of connections is poignant, though reliance on mystical clichés limits originality. Ends on a resonant image but lacks narrative daring.</comment>
