<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but not fully realized; Mira’s backstory is told rather than shown, and secondary characters serve plot function over psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—exposition about the Great Silence disrupts momentum, but the tight focus on a single interaction and the seed exchange provides cohesion within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (herbs, metallic tang) and the nostalgia vault’s eerie preservation of analog tech immerse readers, but political context lacks grounding specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (seeds as cultural bridges) and layered tone ("mirthful solemnity") deepen thematic resonance; dialogue is sparse but poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original use of botanical and communication remnants to explore cultural fragmentation; avoids overt clichés though "revolutionary nexus" feels slightly overused. Lush but purposeful prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (vault, herbs) are purposeful and interwoven, with concise storytelling that avoids feeling artificially constrained by the format.</comment>
