<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character shows clear motivation and contradiction (cynical yet hopeful), but inner conflict remains under-explored despite strong external actions and dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression with poetic rhythm, but the transformation of despair into hope feels slightly rushed in the word limit, lacking visceral development of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting merges mythic and ecological elements masterfully; bioluminescent details and fireflies create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that mirrors thematic tensions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("laughter as seeds") and layered subtext elevate the narrative; dialogue is sparse but resonant, with a powerful emotional arc distilled into a compact space.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept (secrets as botanical metaphors), but some lyrical passages border on overwrought ("peaceful frenzy"), and the cynical character voice occasionally slips into didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in intent and execution, though the brevity leaves some thematic threads (e.g., the ferryman's transformation) feeling undernourished despite potent imagery.</comment>
