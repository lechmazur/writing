<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyra's "skeptically credulous" trait drives her arc, but emotional depth feels shallow; motivations are clear but lack layered internal conflict. The "guarded minstrel" role underutilized in favor of thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cipher discovery logically propels plot, but the nano-forest's sudden revolt strains plausibility within the word limit. Pacing feels uneven as metaphor overwhelms narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (nano-forest hums, deer leaping on a macro scale) create vivid immersion. The sterile climate dome contrasts well with organic rebellion, though historical weight of the Movement remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-to-literal transition (songs as revolution) delivers impactful symmetry. Thematic unity of art vs. commodification resonates, though emotional stakes remain more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concepts (e.g., "angry peace") verge on clich√©. The cipher device feels formulaic; some descriptive flourishes ("burned through Lyra with angry peace") tip into purple prose. Subversion of "preservation" is clever but unevenly executed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence and striking imagery carry the story despite rushed execution. The brief format works for conceptual punch but sacrifices character depth and worldbuilding complexity.</comment>
