<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are mostly clear (Marcus’s preservation mission, Lily’s ambiguous loyalty), but some traits like “ghostly resolve” feel underdeveloped or overly abstract. Dialogue reveals character well but occasionally leans on exposition (e.g., “You chose your path” speech).</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear arc within constraints: Marcus’s initial evasion, shift to understanding Lily’s intent, and resolution through her data chip. Pacing is tight and purposeful, though the twist feels abrupt without deeper foreshadowing of Lily’s alliance. No major logic gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The biodome’s artificial ecosystem (glowing chlorophyll, eternal spring) creates a vivid, haunting contrast with dying languages. Sensory details (humming atmosphere, synthetic dawn, whispers of ghost language) immerse readers. Setting is deeply intertwined with theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story evokes urgency through metaphor (“languages die in permanent winter”) and subtext (corporate erasure vs. human preservation). Dialogue is crisp and thematic. Ending crystallizes the central conflict without overselling; emotional stakes are shown through actions (recording Henrik) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in fusion of linguistic preservation and corporate dystopia. Avoids clichés: dares as warnings, gift tags as narrative devices, and bilingual dialects feel fresh. Some phrases (“desperate precision”) veer toward generic, but most details are evocative and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong: every element serves character, plot, or theme. Length forces brevity but enhances focus. Lingering questions about corporate motives and broader linguistic war feel intentional, not underdeveloped. Leaves intellectual impact, not just emotional.</comment>
