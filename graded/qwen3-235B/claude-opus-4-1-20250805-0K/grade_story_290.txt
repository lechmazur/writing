<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cipher-like characters with philosophical musings lack emotional grounding; motivations stem from plot demands rather than organic development. Dialogue functions thematically but without human nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Philosophical confrontation drives the minimalist plot effectively but lacks narrative momentum within tight constraints. Conceptual conclusion satisfies thematic symmetry more than narrative expectations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rain-soaked decay of civilization creates visceral atmosphere. Surreal physics of Harmonic Caves underexploited. Sensory details concentrated in opening paragraphs with diminishing returns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense with striking metaphors (power-as-fluidity) and subtext about cyclical revolution. Ending provokes contemplation about perpetual instability as freedom. Emotional impact diluted by abstract characterizations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Blends cosmic weirdness with post-apocalyptic tropes in conceptually interesting ways. Occasional over-embellishment ("apocalyptic drums") detracts. Tropes about fallen empires and chosen ones remain insufficiently subverted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function more as symbolic scaffolding than cohesive narrative architecture. Ambitious thematic synthesis struggles to overcome episodic structure and philosophical exposition.</comment>
