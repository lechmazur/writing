<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to preserve fading music is clear, but inner conflict feels underexplored. Dialogue and action align with her role as a guardian, yet emotional depth lacks nuance beyond archetypal “feral savior” tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc (arrival, preservation, departure), but the word limit strains cause-effect clarity. The apprentice’s question feels hastily addressed, and pacing leans on poetic transitions over narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original—vanishing stars, silent orchestras, and the ink’s liquidity create haunting sensory layers. The setting’s surreal logic enhances the theme without feeling arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholy and urgency through metaphor (e.g., “compressed symphonies”). The ending’s philosophical reflection on preservation-as-music resonates, but subtext occasionally prioritizes lyricism over character-driven impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids major tropes, though phrases like “liquid starlight” and “ghostly notations” flirt with overused poetic abstraction. Emotional resonance is implied through imagery rather than earned through character vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (ink, vanishing stars, bookworm) cohere to a theme, but the story’s brevity leaves some underdeveloped. The “effortlessly complicated” method feels conceptually thin, yet the metaphorical core lingers memorably.</comment>
