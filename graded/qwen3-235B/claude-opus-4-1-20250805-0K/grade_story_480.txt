<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually intriguing but lack sufficient emotional granularity; the protagonist’s internal conflicts feel somewhat superficial despite the unique profession. Dialogue minimalism avoids artificiality but sacrifices depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but rushes critical turning points. The revelation about the sister’s intention lacks gradual buildup. Cause-effect logic holds, but pacing feels constrained rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting evokes tactile melancholy (dying lights, blue phone glows) but underuses sensory details beyond visuals. The abandoned mess hall/music hall duality effectively mirrors digital decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“haunt differently”) elevate thematic resonance about digital erasure. Subtext about commodified memory works sublimely. Ending’s existential ambiguity rewards rereading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Virtually no clichés; “familiar strangers” concept and burner phone imagery feel fresh. Avoids purple prose while maintaining poetic precision. Subverts “rescue narrative” expectations effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Elements cohere tightly within the speculative framework. Economy of language transforms constraints into structural strength, though secondary worldbuilding occasionally feels undercooked.</grade>
