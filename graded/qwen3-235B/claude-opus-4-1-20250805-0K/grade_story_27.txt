<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Secondary characters lack depth, but Eleanor's portrayal as a truth-tied cynic and Marcus's stagnant mind-to-transformation arc are consistent and well-communicated through terse, purposeful dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong internal logic and moon-phase mechanics drive the plot, but the pivotal choice feels narratively compressed within the word limit, requiring more emotional buildup for Marcus's abrupt reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative haunted elements (Ferris wheel, owl) create atmosphere, but deeper integration of bird-watching as thematic motif and more tactile details (rot-scented air, creaking wood) could strengthen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphor density ("silken blade" dialogue) and layered subtext about truth's paradoxes elevate the tale, while precise avian imagery creates lingering philosophical resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Some moon-phase explanations (e.g. "petrify before completion") could feel trope-adjacent, but the cynic-truth mechanic and avian symbolism demonstrate creative subversion of genre conventions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of constraints with thematic weight about self-transformation, though the compact form prioritizes concept over full emotional exploration, leaving minor gaps in character evolution.</comment>
