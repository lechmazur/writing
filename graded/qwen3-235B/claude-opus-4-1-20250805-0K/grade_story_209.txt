<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths in guilt-driven motivation and symbolic object use, but internal contradictions (woodsman identity vs. radio mapping) and underexplored emotional depth prevent higher score.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clever cause-effect chain through electromagnetic metaphors, but compressed timeframe strains plausibility and resolution feels abrupt despite strong thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radiant atmospheric fusion of decaying technology and spectral memory; "invisible flowers" and hospital-heartbeat synchronization create haunting, cohesive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional poetic metaphors ("monitor sang its rhythm") and layered tension between physical objects and intangible echoes; theme resonates but finality of wife's death underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of electromagnetic surrealism with family trauma; avoids overt clich√©s but slightly over-relies on "forgiveness from beyond" trope and abstract emotional states.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structural integration of all elements is impressive, though the radio garden's mechanics occasionally feel contrived; leaves powerful emotional aftermath but lacks philosophical expansiveness.</comment>
