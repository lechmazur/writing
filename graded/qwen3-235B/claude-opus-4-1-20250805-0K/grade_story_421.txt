<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyra's nomadic past is hinted as preparation for her mission, but her emotional transitions feel abrupt; Marcus's "ferociously polite" mask lacks deeper exploration of his personal cost.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Solid arc compressed into constraints, but the intervention setup feels rushed; coin toss consequence lacks visceral immediacy despite strong thematic bookending through the mariner's wheel.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Flower workshop's sensory immersion creates haunting duality between preservation and subversion; "lavender-scented air" and bleeding pressed colors effectively mirror the protagonist's conflicted beauty/war duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose balances haunting metaphors ("flowers like forgotten memories") with taut environmental allegory; the ending's emotional complexity—tears of "terrible happiness"—elevates beyond action-adventure tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on familiar eco-espionage tropes; some phrases ("angushed joy") verge on poetic abstraction rather than organically earned pathos; mission execution remains vaguer than character beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into compelling whole despite formal constraints, though the "storm" metaphor risks overstatement; leaves lingering questions about moral ambiguity beneath the idealism.</comment>
