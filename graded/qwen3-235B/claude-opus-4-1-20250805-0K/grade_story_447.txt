<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Martha's motivation (mending community through hope) is clear and influences her actions, but internal conflict about ethical implications of manipulating news is underexplored. Her voice lacks idiosyncratic traits that would make her narration distinctive in a first-person story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc from discovery to sacrifice, with cause-effect between her actions and town's behavior. Pacing tightens in final paragraphs, losing some emotional weight in the self-fulfilling prophecy explanation. Connection between beginning/end slightly strained by compressed word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Amber tint effectively symbolizes both false healing and Martha's distorted perspective. Sensory details (threads dissolving into stew, steam-bound prophecies) deepen atmosphere, but time constraints limit exploration of how the "prison" affects daily life beyond Martha's window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (ear as conduit for truth, stew as vessel for transformation) add depth. Ending carries thematic weight about truth's cost, though exposition about self-fulfilling prophecies lacks subtle buildup. Minor characters serve plot mechanics over psychological realism but maintain conceptual cohesion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story avoids genre templates through specific metaphors (e.g. unraveling ear threads as both literal and symbolic deterioration). No flowery language or mechanical phrasing - sentences maintain purposeful simplicity. Emotional nuance emerges through actions (pressing ear to glass) rather than direct statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Idea of truth-as-catalyst resonates beyond narrative. Elements work symbiotically (torn ear enabling prophetic steam), though rapid disintegration feels somewhat plot-convenient rather than thematically necessary. The "amber prison" metaphor has room for deeper exploitation.</comment>
