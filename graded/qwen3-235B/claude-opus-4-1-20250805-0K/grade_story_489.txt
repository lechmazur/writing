<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Brazen calm is effectively shown through action, but grandmother's aggressively kind insistence lacks depth. Maya's motivation to preserve tradition is clear but underexplored—personal stakes remain surface-level. The bridge role in finale feels externally imposed rather than organically emerging from her traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Instant footfall initiating action creates strong structural trigger. The 400-word dance crescendo maintains causal logic but struggles with temporal compression—whale-song emergence and ancestral communion happen almost instantaneously. Pacing tension between gradual buildup and abrupt transcendence creates minor narrative dissonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse's stones-as-observers technique masterfully merges setting with sentience. Whale song vibrations in physical architecture create tactile atmosphere. Lingering cigarette burns on floorboards and marrow-deep cold establish sensory specificity that elevates rather than distracts from ethereal elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors of "whale-song braiding" and "pressure in the chest" from ancestral observers convey subtext about cultural dissonance. Ending's thematic harmony between "bridge" metaphor and ritual reinvention feels earned, though reliance on "knowledge to decline" risks moralizing. Tension between tourist erasure and ancestral continuity creates lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some overuse of "oceanic vastness" clichés mitigated by specific details like "plastic whistle conducting ancient purposes." Avoids generic "haunted" tropes through physical setting elements (cracked floorboards, window trauma). Emotional landscape shows through ritual mechanics rather than explicit declarations, though ancestral consciousness "pressure" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Elements coalesce into cohesive mythopoeic framework despite compressed form. Lighthouse as literal/spiritual crossroads provides architectural narrative logic. Brief length's constraint becomes virtue in focusing on single transformative moment. Lingering thought about cultural preservation through embodied memory transcends immediate plot mechanics.</grade>
