<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's impulsiveness and whimsy are stated but not deeply demonstrated through action. Her motivation to perform the finale feels intrinsic but lacks psychological complexity; emotional inheritance is clear but under-explored in her internal struggles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (discovery → journey → performance → resolution) but rushes secondary character introductions. Tracking shooting stars as a plot device strains credulity; cause-effect between inherited trauma and musical climax needs more nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fortress setting is richly textured with tactile and auditory details (waterfall's roar, crumbling stones), dusk's violet shadows enhance melancholy. Atmosphere supports thematic parallels between natural chaos and unresolved symphony, though integration could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("music as sacred flame," "whimsy as sword") deepen themes of legacy. The symbolic finale resolving historical injustice through artistry is poignant and resonant; ending avoids catharsis clichés with restrained emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages (e.g., "whimsical sound that tumbled like the waterfall") border on preciousness. Avoids genre tropes but occasionally over-relies on archetypal imagery (arrow slits, shooting stars). Subtext about art's power feels genuine but not pioneering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements; music sheet and fortress are indispensable. Timeframe compression sacrifices character depth but maintains thematic momentum. Leaves lingering questions about art as inheritance versus theft.</comment>
