<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's transition from arrogance to humility is emotionally plausible, with motivations tied to familial legacy deeply influencing actions. The internal conflict feels authentic, though the rapid transformation lacks subtle progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant throughline from relic discovery to vocal resurrection; the cyclical structure (memory -> confrontation -> renewal) is satisfyingly complete. Pacing balances introspection and momentum within limitations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral details like "smoke and sickness" on fabric and "ink grinding" create tactile history. Atmosphere bridges personal grief and cultural erasure with sensory precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (memory as blood inheritance, song as restorative act) operate on literal and symbolic levels. Subtext about cultural transmission elevates the narrative into universal resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original interplay between martial and artistic traditions avoids clich√©. Emotional nuance emerges through physicalized memories rather than exposition. Prose avoids purple patches while maintaining poetic heft.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements function orchestrally - each assigned component serves theme, character, or plot without superfluity. Concise form becomes narrative strength rather than constraint.</comment>
