<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth; "logical emotion" remains underexplored beyond surface-level exposition, insufficiently shaping actions or inner conflict. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot uses countdown effectively for pacing, but compressed word limit leaves transitions abrupt; beginning/end cohesion exists yet feels superficially resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with jasmine/tunnels but relies on over-described decay rather than unique sensory specificity; cathedral-whispering gallery connection underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery elevates theme of preservation-as-rebellion; ending resonates metaphorically, though emotional impact softened by overt philosophical exposition rather than subtextual nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in combining mapping/child's relic, but contains faintly mechanical phrases ("evolution's way of keeping him alive") and sentimental undertones that undercut rigor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements function but lack interconnectivity; premise remains conceptually striking without transcendent execution; some details feel curated rather than essential to thematic unity.</comment>
