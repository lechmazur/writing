<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's actions align with her occupation and ghost-seeing ability, but her internal logic about silence and loss remains underexplored; the emotional connection to the ghost's story feels implied rather than earned through layered characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc but relies on convenient repetition ("lunch break stalking") rather than organic progression; the connection between sand preservation and the ghost's anchor feels conceptually strong but execution lacks narrative depth in limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (metals vs. brittle flowers) and the eerie silence create immersive tension; the sand castle lab's paradoxical beauty amplifies themes of impermanence, though its scientific rationale feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (frozen collapse/fragile crown) and the tactile dissolution of the crown deliver emotional resonance; the "dissonance of silence" as a physical sensation is particularly powerful, with subtext about cultural forgetting (ignored history) enriching the main theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imaginative premise avoids genre clich√©s, though the "tragic scientist ghost" trope risks predictability; Marina's profession feels more plot-mandated than thematically essential, and some phrasing ("sweetness" of final quiet) verges on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain under compression; the lab setting and letting-go theme shine, while the elevator technician framing device and tour group juxtaposition feel underutilized in service of the deeper emotional arc.</comment>
