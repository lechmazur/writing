<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength in paradoxical traits (gentle brawler) but lacks deeper psychological complexity; social documentation motivation is conceptually rich but underexplored emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elegant use of tight structure but some plot elements feel compressed or arbitrarily juxtaposed (flat tire's relevance, resolution with guard feels abrupt within constraints).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Superb integration of core elements creates thematic resonance; minor inconsistencies in narrative mechanics prevent perfect cohesion within brief format.</comment>
