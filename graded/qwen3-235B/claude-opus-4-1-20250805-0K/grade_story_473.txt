<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth despite clear motivations; interactions are archetypal rather than fully realized. Assigned traits are applied superficially without sufficient psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels compressed; pacing unevenly balances workshop progression with thematic resolution. Logical cause-effect but lacks tension within artificial constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting provides strong visual contrast but underutilizes sensory immersion. Solar canopy/orchard juxtaposition works symbolically but lacks visceral presence to fully ground philosophical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism through pruning metaphors and dissolution of legacy. Ending subverts expectations with paradoxical empowerment-through-erasure theme. Dialogue minimal but atmospheric craft maintains impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar "lonely guardian" archetype. Pruning-as-leadership metaphor effective yet recognizable. Writing style purposeful but lacks distinctive authorial fingerprints that elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements create thematic cohesion but some feel mechanically imposed (disclaimers, timeframe). Deliberate brevity serves philosophical payoff but sacrifices emotional weight. Final impact thought-provoking if not entirely transformative.</comment>
