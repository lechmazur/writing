<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation regarding inherited rivalry is clear, but deeper introspection or flaws missing; minimal emotional complexity for a literary protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minimal plot arc (reconciliation in coffee line) feels rushed; thematic resolution earned but lacks tension. Pacing uneven in tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop stables' fusion of anachronistic elements (horses/solar panels) creates vivid, novel atmosphere; sensory details (horse mist, drone sounds) immerse effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose (clouds as cosmic letters, stamp as eroded memory) elevates narrative; ending provides emotional resonance through quiet subversion of rivalry tropes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Few formulaic phrases ("electric hymn," "ancient dance") offset otherwise original concept; avoids clich√©s through juxtaposition of celestial and mundane, but some adverbial clutter remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story succeeds as self-contained thematic microcosm but lacks ambition to transcend premise; literary potential undercut by thin character dynamics despite precise execution.</comment>
