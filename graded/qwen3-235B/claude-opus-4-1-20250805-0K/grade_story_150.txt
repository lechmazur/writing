<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voices but motivations lack depth; the outlaw poet persona adds flavor but isn't fully integrated with psychological complexity or consistent behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight pacing within constraints; the misalignment of Venus and dice convergence create an organic arc, though the revelation's rapid execution slightly undermines emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich synesthesia anchors the setting (clicking gears, glowing runes, mechanical arm), with the dynamic graffiti and steampunk architecture organically intensifying the surreal, fateful atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Multi-layered metaphors (dice as ancestral memory, walls as oracular text) create thematic unity; the ending transcends surface plot to explore cosmic synchronicity and artistic purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imaginative but occasionally overwritten (e.g., "saturated ambivalence"); avoids most tropes through specific metaphors (mechanical arms, rune-activated dice) and unexpected intersections between theatrical and cosmic rehearsals.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative's mythic tone; the brevity enhances mystery rather than hinders coherence, though the integration of "rehearsals" feels slightly thematic over structural.</comment>
