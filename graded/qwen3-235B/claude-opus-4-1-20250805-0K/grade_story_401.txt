<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya’s guilt and professional instincts drive her actions, with her wilderness guide background influencing her underwater approach. Motivation for reconciliation is clear but hinted at through fragmented interiority rather than sustained emotional arcs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The descent, coded blanket reading, and ritual resolution form a cohesive arc, but the compressed pacing of her emotional unraveling risks feeling abrupt rather than earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid underwater imagery (fish-filled chandeliers, algae-slick floors) and the juxtaposition of a pirate ballroom’s decay with Maya’s guilt create atmospheric depth, though the connection to "morning coffee" remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (blanket as diary, ring as symbolic surrender) and the subtext of buried guilt-as-landscape elevate the story. The ending’s emotional resonance is earned, though some phrasing (e.g., "manic clarity") leans on abstract terms over embodied tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés and maintains a consistent tone, though occasional phrases ("liquid guilt") tilt toward melodrama. Sensory details (tactile blanket knots, filtered sunlight) ground the narrative but aren’t uniformly layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements cohesively, but some (e.g., morning coffee) feel thematically undercooked. The story’s brevity serves its elliptical tone but limits fuller exploration of Maya’s transformation.</comment>
