<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity and motivation are conceptually intriguing but underdeveloped; the soul's urgings lack concrete connection to her routine. Emotions remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Static vignette structure prevents plot progression. The beginning/end loop lacks narrative momentum, though circular emphasis on routine works thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory specifics (mushroom spores, circus sawdust) create haunting worldbuilding. The surreal setting's interplay with electromagnetic plant stress creates unique atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors ("soil as musical scores") and thematic depth about purpose's mundanity impress. Emotional resonance diluted by over-reliance on abstract language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh integration of botanical radio waves and enchanted objects avoids genre tropes. Some descriptors border on purple prose, but surreal logic feels distinctly authored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Singular atmosphere and conceptual fusion of decay/rebirth resonate, but cohesive narrative purpose feels elusive. Worldbuilding dominates over character or plot momentum.</comment>
