<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character is defined by archetype and backstory rather than nuanced behavior; motivation is plausible but lacks depth in how shame transforms into action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but feels compressed; cause-and-effect logic holds, yet the pivotal DNA sequence resolution appears abruptly without sufficient technical or emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hyper-detailed cyberpunk setting is vivid, immersive, and conceptually cohesive, though some neon-laden descriptions verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance between prison metaphor and biological engineering; emotional undercurrents surface effectively but occasionally override subtlety with explicit declarations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Balances poetic language with narrative clarity; avoids most AI hallmarks but leans on familiar cyberpunk tropes (corporate dystopia, redemptive tech) without radical recontextualization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</comment><grade>Story builds toward a thematically coherent payoff, though brevity sacrifices complexity; interwoven elements function successfully but not inextricably.</comment>
