<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's role as ghostwriter shapes her identity crisis, but motivation lacks gradual build-up. Internal conflict shown through symbolic actions, though emotional depth remains surface-level. Ritual of planting sandals effectively reveals her yearning for authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing compresses 40-year backstory into brief exposition, but the descent, ritual, and impending transformation create satisfying arc. Underground orchard's function and decay of speeches drive coherent cause-and-effect. Orchestra timing as parallel structure slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luminous fungus, decaying speeches, and root-sprouting footwear create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details (bioluminescence, sound of tuning) immerse reader while thematically resonant. Subterranean sanctuary feels mythically ancient and ecologically distinctive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (decomposition/rebirth, swallowed voice) elevates plot beyond literal to profound. Metaphors connect political artifice to organic truth, though some poetic passages verge on excessive. Ending's transformation offers thematic closure while maintaining poetic ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in fungal ecosystem consuming lies. Avoids clich√©s about political corruption through biological surrealism. Character logic balances poetic motivation with practical ritual mechanics. Avoids AI-style repetition through sustained metaphorical consistency.</comment>
