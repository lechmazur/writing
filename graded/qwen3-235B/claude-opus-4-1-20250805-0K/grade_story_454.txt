<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's reckless and rationally emotional traits are hinted at but remain surface-level; motivations (loyalty, joining Collective) lack nuanced exploration of inner conflict or transformation; actions align with traits but lack depth beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure (setup, drop, exit) but relies on premise over organic momentum; cause/effect logical yet underdeveloped tension; pacing uneven in middle but achieves minimal arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Haunted funhouse creates evocative visuals, but sensory details are uneven (auditory/visual over others); map tear conceptually connected to theme but underutilized; atmosphere leans on tropes without distinctive layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (clover, mirrors) and subtext about trust-as-ritual elevate impact; ending's thematic resonance (loneliness as acceptance) is poignant but underdeveloped; emotional beats shown more than told, though occasionally opaque.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some overused elements (haunted spaces, clovers as luck) undercut freshness; avoids most AI markers but relies on familiar "ritualized secrecy" tropes; prose is tight but occasionally stylized over substance; ideas feel conceptually human but execution risks generic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack symbiotic depth; style supports mystery without overcomplicating; length works but sacrifices emotional payoff; thematic unity exists but lacks distinctive fingerprint; leaves curiosity, not urgency.</comment>
