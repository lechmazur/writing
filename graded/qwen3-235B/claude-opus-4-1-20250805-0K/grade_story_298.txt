<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth in exploring how being a chameleon actor fundamentally alters psychological responses to trauma. Shift to vulnerability feels under-earned despite strong final moment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a cogent arc but relies on coincidence in light-pattern discovery. Pacing occasionally bogs down in descriptive passages at expense of tension, though the ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-oil greenhouse palace creates haunting atmosphere through specific details like tomatoes growing through murals. Sensory integration exceptional, though some descriptions verge on excessive ornateness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story wields metaphor with intelligence, connecting theatrical reproduction to survival. The final moment of emotional truth transcends plot mechanics, though subtextual exploration of art as preservation remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in merging acting methodology with investigation, but contains occasional overused phrases ("monuments to absence"). Emotional states sometimes named rather than shown, minor AI-trope proximity in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements coalesce into resonant whole despite brevity. The symbolic throughlines connect effectively, though economic use of components feels slightly engineered rather than organically discovered.</comment>
