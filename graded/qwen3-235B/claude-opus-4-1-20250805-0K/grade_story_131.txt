<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya’s aloofness and history of displacement are effectively shown through concrete details (e.g., the stones as “witnesses to impermanence”), but her transformation into finding courage lacks sustained interiority to fully sell emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression is conceptually tight, with the stones and message driving key revelations, but the abrupt resolution of the anomaly feels compressed, slightly undermining the weight of her climactic act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The anomaly’s surreal physics and the garage’s normalcy are vividly contrasted through precise details (e.g., warping metal “like breathing”), but the emotional texture of the wider world’s collapse is underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., stones as emotional anchors, the lottery ticket as “forgotten hope”) resonate deeply, with the ending’s thematic shift from survival to active transformation landing with poetic clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise avoids overt clichés, and the anomaly/stones combination is inventive, but some descriptors (e.g., “grasp of abandonment”) lean toward slight abstraction rather than striking specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly woven into a cohesive whole, with the anomaly’s retreat directly tied to the stones’ symbolism, though the lottery ticket’s role feels slightly serendipitous rather than fully earned.</comment>
