<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits but lacks inner tension; motivations are clear yet her relationship to her past and specific emotional nuances remain underexplored despite strong external actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive and thematically rich, but the compressed word limit leaves some transitions feeling implied rather than fully articulated, slightly weakening the narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dense, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details; setting actively shapes the protagonist's growth and thematic resonance, though a few phrases verge on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Profound subtext through organic symbolism (e.g., royal jelly ritual, mouse tracks), lyrical style, and a resonant ending; emotional impact is thoughtful rather than visceral but still effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending scifi and biology; metaphors are fresh and purposeful. Avoids formula by grounding human themes in ecological observation rather than predictable tech tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story seamlessly integrates assigned elements, but the brevity sacrifices moments of deeper interplay between character and concept; retains conceptual brilliance within constraints.</comment>
