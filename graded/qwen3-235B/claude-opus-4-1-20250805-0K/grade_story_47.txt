<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters show consistent motivations but lack psychological complexity; Margaret's emotional response to the choreographer's legacy feels underexplored despite functional narrative role</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Non-linear structure with voice notes effectively creates narrative cohesion; pacing remains tight without rushing thematic development despite word constraints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echoing sanctuary serves as potent character and thematic vessel; tactile details (glove texture, stone floor) and sonic deprivation create visceral, immersive atmosphere</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mortality and artistry avoids clich√©; some phrases ("cryptic voice notes") border on formulaic but purposeful imagery pushes beyond predictable patterns</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work in concert (sanctuary's silence enables raw performance, glove bridges past/present) though certain connections (eagerly jaded dancer's backstory) remain underdeveloped</comment>
