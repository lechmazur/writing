<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between faith and transcendence is present but lacks sufficient evolution to feel fully realized; her transformation reads as abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but slightly rushed; the piano-ritual climax connects conceptually but lacks structural momentum to fully satisfy the narrative arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously crafted—glass desert and decaying mission house create a haunting, immersive setting that amplifies the tension between decay and transcendence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (e.g., Fibonacci sequences mirroring cathedral windows) and metaphorical layering elevate the story; the ending’s ambiguity rewards engagement but occasionally veils emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality in merging theological inquiry with mathematical/sonic mysticism stands out; avoids genre clichés, though occasional florid descriptions (e.g., “phantom monarchs”) risk veering into ornamental excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of assigned elements; the story’s philosophical gravity gives it weight, though the brevity limits deeper exploration of Margot’s post-transformation identity.</comment>
