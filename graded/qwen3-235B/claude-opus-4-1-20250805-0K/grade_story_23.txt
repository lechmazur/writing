<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters fulfill roles but lack emotional depth; Thessalion’s humor and the keeper’s transformation feel surface-level. Dialogue reveals traits but doesn’t deepen motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but resolution feels abrupt; solar wind-to-cosmic salvation skips intermediate steps, weakening causal impact within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting dazzles with cosmic imagery but lacks tactile contrasts; atmosphere leans on abstraction without grounding the reader in physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like “universe’s repair manual” elevate the narrative; emotional resonance is undercut by overreliance on exposition about concepts like entropy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overtly whimsical metaphors and cosmic anthropomorphism risk cliché; dialogue’s levity feels fresh but occasionally masks narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of elements with uneven cohesion; the cosmic-leaf conceit elevates originality, but pacing strains internal logic.</comment>
