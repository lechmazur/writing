<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Average physical description fails to anchor the seer's "analytically innovative" trait in identifiable human behavior. Motivation to "unearth a mythic relic" remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear trajectory from USB discovery to decryption succeeds despite word constraints, but Morrison's backstory gets shortchanged, leaving the "delayed justice" payoffs undernourished.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (petrichor, wilting party decorations) create rich atmosphere, though the connection between the tower's decay and the justice theme feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the plot beyond procedural thriller tropes, but emotional resonance softens at the edges rather than piercing—justice feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids procedural clichés in decryption method, though Morrison's "case that destroyed him" leans on familiar trauma tropes without subverting them. Language consistently purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively, but the tight focus on execution overshadows deeper thematic exploration. The ending lingers, if not quite indelibly.</comment>
