<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks layered complexity; prince's actions align with his exile-driven loneliness, but emotional depth remains restrained by the format's brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but feels compressed; the sudden transformation of the office strains logic despite thematic resonance, and the condensed arc sacrifices nuance for symbolic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (crumbling office, storm, jade texture) that mirror the protagonist's isolation and the story's pivot to communal hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (mortar as a cure, isolation vs. community) and the silent revelation of the prince's symbolic power resonate through subtext and symbolic action, though the ending leans slightly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its thematic focus on exile as a collective experience rather than individual tragedy, with fresh use of "unseen forces" as marginalized voices; poetic but not self-indulgent prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively into a thematic whole; the historical and symbolic weight of each component gives the story its architecture, though the pacing occasionally falters under its ambitions.</comment>
