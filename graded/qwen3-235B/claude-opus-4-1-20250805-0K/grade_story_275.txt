<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hermit's motivation for ecological resurrection through scientific methods is clear, but introspection beyond her actions remains shallow. Her mysterious nature works narratively but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression serves the premise but lacks dramatic tension. The repetitive planting action sustains momentum but creates circularity rather than traditional structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Starkly beautiful imagery of scorched earth under comet light creates visceral immersion. Atmospheric details (ash-written language, mineral memory soil) elevate setting into active storytelling element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors connecting scientific methodology to ritual (pressed flowers as genetic memory, songs as frequency science) create resonant thematic harmony between observation and resurrection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major AI tropes with specific details (37-degree angle physics, bacterial awakening science), but occasional ornate phrases ("indifferent comet", "deliberate wilderness") border on melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Extraordinary atmosphere and thematic unity compensate for modest character development. Story operates as lyrical allegory while maintaining narrative coherence within strict word constraints.</comment>
