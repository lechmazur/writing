<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characterization is conceptually strong but lacks depth; Marcus's loyalty is established but motivations for balancing inner storms remain underexplored despite journal and decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has momentum through outage-decoding-revelation sequence, but the sudden moth mandala formation feels contrived; tension-resolution arc is compressed yet functional within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (flickering lights, mandala moths) create tangible dread and wonder; tone supports internal/external chaos duality but doesn't fully exploit setting's symbolic potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and layered symbolism (jokes as instruction, moths as chaos/creation metaphors) elevate impact; Keeper's subversive teaching method rewards active reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids cliche through surreal logic; coded comedy/meditation synthesis feels singular; occasional purple prose ("sanctified dread") undermines subtlety but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere—journal decodes, outage enables radicalization through jokes—but some feel conceptually detached (moth observation tower's purpose); thematic unity strong despite minor clunkiness.</comment>
