<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's 'kindly' trait remains underexplored despite symbolic depth; disloyalty is well-motivated but voice lacks distinctiveness in first-person sections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has emotional momentum but lacks concrete cause-effect progression; repetitive circling around abstract concepts weakens structural coherence in the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through richly synesthetic details (scent of foam, hum of fluorescent lights) that fuse setting with emotional texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formula through metaphysical abstractions and unconventional motifs; some phrasing risks preciousness but overall maintains stylistic individuality without machine-generated tics.</comment>
