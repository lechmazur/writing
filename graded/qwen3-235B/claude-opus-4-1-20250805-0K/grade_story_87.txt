<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Patient librarian's precision and vengeful motivation are clear but lack depth in showcasing her inner conflict beyond intellectual betrayal. The encoded resonance serves as clever motivation but doesn't fully explore her emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plotted with rhythmic tension but struggles to balance the 17-year grudge exposition with present action. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steampunk elements form a living, breathing mechanismâ€”whistles/hiss/tactile surfaces create immersive contradiction between industrial and emotional. Atmosphere becomes character through sonic metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sublime fusion of mechanical and emotional through static-as-memory, frequency-as-testimony. Ending transcends simple revenge to explore embedded legacy, with architectural haunting as perfect metaphor for unresolved trauma.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant subversion of revenge trope through non-destructive resonance, but "savage grace" occasionally leans into melodrama. Sticker metaphors risk preciousness but mostly maintain narrative muscle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements feel both purposefully woven (mixtapes as emotional transmitters) and occasionally dutiful (timeframe's poeticism doesn't deepen narrative). Technical specificity strengthens authenticity.</comment>
