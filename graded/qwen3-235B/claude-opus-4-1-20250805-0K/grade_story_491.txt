<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and a clear central motivation, but backstory remains underdeveloped. While the torn wristband offers visual symbolism, it doesn't deeply influence her actions or decision-making process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central action propels the plot effectively, with clear cause-effect between quilt destruction and plant resurrection. However, the brief word limit leaves some narrative beats underdeveloped, particularly the transition between phases of her nightly ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting creates an evocative foundation, but sensory descriptions lean on familiar tropes ("fogged glass," "luminous botanical blueprints"). Atmosphere supports theme but lacks distinctive olfactory/tactile elements to fully immerse readers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Uses sophisticated metaphors (quilt as prison) and weaves subtext about preservation paradoxes. The ending provides poetic resolution while maintaining emotional distance, favoring intellectual impact over visceral connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept with quilt-as-DNA-archive avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing ("wisdom in ancient texts written in chlorophyll") veers toward overwrought poeticism. Character motivations maintain humanistic logic, though the resurrection mechanism leans on speculative convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around the interplay between elements, though some (wristband, timeframe) feel tangential rather than essential. Themes of preservation vs. freedom emerge clearly, but emotional impact remains measured rather than visceral.</comment>
