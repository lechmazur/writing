<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks depth; abrupt transformation into prophet lacks earned emotional weight. Inner conflict underdeveloped despite surreal context. Dialogue feels expository rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is conceptually coherent but structurally compressed. Key transitions rely on narrative convenience rather than earned progression. Pacing uneven despite tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly evocative sensory details in shifts between laundromat and study. Atmospheric consistency maintained through visual motifs, though emotional resonance of settings underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance between paper flower and multiverse concept. Theme of connection surfaces effectively, but emotional impact diluted by heavy exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-tropes but contains abstract passages that border on poetic vagueness. Sensory details mostly specific but occasionally generic (e.g., "haunting delight"). Clich√©d phrasing (e.g., "coming home") appears.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion is strong, but execution leaves gaps in emotional and thematic nuance. Brief length feels both deliberate in theme and limiting in development. Ends on lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
