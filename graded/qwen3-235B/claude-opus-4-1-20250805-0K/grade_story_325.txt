<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thornweather's scientific obsession is sharply defined, but her 'madness' remains underexplored. Chen's loyalty shift is narratively functional but psychologically underdeveloped. Dialogue reveals character traits (comically serious tone) but lacks interiority to solidify motivations beyond plot function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ionization-driven plot progresses logically from plant reactions to hidden film revelation, with tight cause-effect between electromagnetic disturbances and pathway manifestation. While compressed, the arc from skepticism to discovery maintains cohesion within the word limit, though some transitions between scientific explanation and mystical manifestation strain believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tea house's high-altitude isolation amplifies atmosphere of mystery, with projector's flicker creating appropriately uncanny shadows. Sensory details about thin air, clinking teacups, and glowing plant fluids effectively ground the surrealism. The intermission timeframe creates narrative tension through artificial time constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually striking moments (glowing pitcher plant coordinates) juxtapose scientific rigor with mystical revelation. The ending is emotionally satisfying but intellectually ambiguous, leaving unexplored implications about lost knowledge. Some expository dialogue weakens immersion despite strong symbolic use of bioluminescent plants as living maps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrative avoids genre clich√©s through specific scientific mechanisms (ionization affecting particular molecules). Sensory details feel precise rather than generic, with atmospheric effects tied directly to plot function. While the "mad scientist" trope resurfaces, it's recontextualized through botany rather than typical mad science tropes. Emotional subtext about preserving ancestral knowledge emerges organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story coherently combines disparate elements through the central metaphor of perception beyond normal sight. The short form works intentionally as a discovery narrative compression. Conceptual integration of botanical science with mystical mapping demonstrates creative synthesis rather than checklist element usage, though some explanations feel expedient.</comment>
