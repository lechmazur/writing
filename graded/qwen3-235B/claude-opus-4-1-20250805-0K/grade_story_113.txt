<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marlowe's hesitation and "shyly loud" duality are established but underexplored; his sister's plush ties to motivation are potent yet lack layered emotional nuance in his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear progression through dreams lacks tension arcs; the timeframe-to-dawn structure provides cohesion, but transitions between dreamscapes feel abrupt despite the word limit's constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visually striking imagery (xenon tunnels, aging dancers) but inconsistent sensory immersion; fragmented dream logic weakens atmospheric continuity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (sorrow's tapestry, Rex as armor) resonate; the ending's quiet hope balances poetic lyricism with narrative restraint, leaving lingering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but leans on "chosen one" frameworks; some purple prose ("metal gods") muddles tone, though subversion of "heroic singer" archetypes adds freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly coherent but unevenly weighted; the plush and "fragility of time" shine, while setting and timeframe occasionally feel decorative rather than integral.</comment>
