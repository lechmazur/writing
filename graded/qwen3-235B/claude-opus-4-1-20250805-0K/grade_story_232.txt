<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina’s transition from physician to archaeologist feels underexplored despite her grandfather’s journal. The blend of personal history and obsession is compelling but could use deeper emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from decoding to discovery with clarity, but the rapid shift from exhaustion to revelation strains believability. The ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mediterranean setting and temple shadows are evocative but lack sensorial depth (e.g., ocean scent, stone texture). Digital nomad camp contrasts modernity and antiquity, yet feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid imagery (coffee swirls, blade’s hum) elevates the mystical. Subtext about unfinished tales works, but the ending leans sentimental without fully resolving the “obsession” theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (e.g., coffee divination is fresh) but relies on predictable family-legacy stakes. Sensory details lean on familiar descriptors (“bleary-eyed,” “black as coffee”) without deeper innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic core (unfinished tales) anchors the narrative, but certain elements (digital camp’s relevance) feel tacked on. Pacing and tone align with the mystical premise but lack narrative urgency.</comment>
