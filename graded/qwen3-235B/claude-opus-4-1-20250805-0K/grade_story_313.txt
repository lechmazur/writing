<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (survival, guilt) are clear but surface-level. His use of "unusually normal calmness" contrasts with his role in a dystopian setting, but interiority remains limited. Dialogue carries thematic heft, but psychological complexity is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a contained arc (isolation → confrontation → ambiguous resolve), but pacing falters in its rush to the ending. The ghost interrogation conceit drives the middle well, yet the beginning lacks grounding while the climax feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually striking setting details (synthetic corn, automated scarecrows) create a desolate atmosphere. The government broadcasts effectively frame the dystopia, though the world feels underexplored. Sensory details (cold tape dispenser) are purposeful but sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered themes (exploitation as "comfort," moral ambiguity) resonate through stark metaphors. Ghosts as manifestations of guilt work on multiple levels. The ending's ambiguity lingers effectively, blending melancholy and philosophical tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mixes familiar dystopian/con-man tropes with fresh angles (ghosts as mournful mirrors, remorse as "slow poison"). Language is restrained but evocative; avoids overwriting. Some conceptual elements (tape dispenser) lean toward the symbolic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite tight word limits. Assigned elements form a thematic web rather than mechanical checklist. Ending feels intentional but risks vagueness. Style serves melancholic tone effectively. Leaves readers questioning the cost of moral compromise.</comment>
