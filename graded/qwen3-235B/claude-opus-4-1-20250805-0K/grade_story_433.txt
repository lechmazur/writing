<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>While Mira's hardheadedness and brokenness motivate her initial actions, her transformation into a nature vessel feels conceptually driven rather than organically connected to her traits. Her quiet demure audacity lacks sufficient buildup to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The seed-choice drives the plot effectively, with clear cause-effect between gallery discovery, prophecy clues, and transformation. Pacing works within the constraint, though the gallery's dissolution feels abrupt. The "struggle against instinct" grounds the arc, while the timeframe and setting maintain thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery's ice sculptures, dissolving paintings, and frost-grown books create vivid, conceptually rich atmosphere. Sensory details (numb fingers, screaming colors, trembling walls) immerse readers in an otherworldly environment that thematically mirrors Mira's transitional state between brokenness and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with poetic precision ("whispers of forgotten dreams," "flowers blooming through ice") while maintaining narrative momentum. Metaphors function as thematic scaffolding (ephemeral vs eternal, brokenness vs wholeness). The bittersweet ending resonates, juxtaposing personal loss against natural triumph without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ephemeral gallery conceit and synesthetic horrors (screaming-color paintings). Some phrasing ("whispering ice") risks familiar fantasy tropes, but the grotesque beauty of Mira's transformation subverts expectations. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolic choices rather than stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere impressively - the snowbound gallery creates logical access to the seed, which thematically ties to both Mira's brokenness and solace-seeking. The tight word limit sacrifices some character depth for poetic vision, but the final image of transient winter flowers achieves haunting thematic resonance.</comment>
