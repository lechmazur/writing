<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's sullenness exists primarily as a descriptor; actions motivated more by symbolic plot demands than psychological depth. Quilt and stamp revelations feel externally imposed rather than organically connected to his emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure, but resolution relies on overly schematic symbolic alignment (patches to control panels, stamps to circuits) without sufficient technical or emotional foundation to make the mechanical resurrection believable within the story's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Immersion through tactile details—corroded turbines, pressurized air, humming fabric—creates visceral cohesion. Watery decay permeates both setting and thematic undercurrents, with sensory precision in describing industrial and domestic remnants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate—quilt as living map, stamps as charged relics, turbines as memory receptors. Ends on transcendent yet grounded revelation. Writing avoids sentimentality; emotional weight accumulates through physical objects rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Purposeful subversion of frontier mythology tropes through generational heirlooms. Sensory details specific enough to avoid generic decay imagery, though occasional phrases ("stubborn refusal to accept boundaries") veer toward abstraction without earned pathos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Conceptual unity and thematic ambition shine through tight integration of elements, but emotional resonance lacks nuance—ending feels more like thematic conclusion than earned catharsis. Some narrative compression strains plausibility.</comment>
