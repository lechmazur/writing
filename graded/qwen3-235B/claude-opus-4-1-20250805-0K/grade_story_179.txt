<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is nuanced but underdeveloped; Marcus's internal conflict between duty and rebellion lacks layers. The ruler's role in shaping his actions is strong, but secondary character reactions (e.g., Petra) feel perfunctory, undermining emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pacing feels compressed; the arc from discovery to rebellion spans just a paragraph. While the ruler drives the action, the cause-effect chain (e.g., authorities discovering Marcus) is under-explained, creating a sense of abrupt resolution despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but underutilized. The beehive's geometric structure mirrors the fingerprint motif, and sensory details (amber walls, pencil hum) create atmosphere. However, the therapeutic colony's mechanics remain superficially sketched, diluting the oppression's visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional undertones—jubilant remorse, repressed rage—elevate the subtext. The fingerprint-as-symbol device is inventive, and the ending's bittersweet tone lingers. However, some poetic descriptions (e.g., "botanical spirals in skin") occasionally lapse into abstraction over concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rarely formulaic: Fingerprint maps as subconscious desires are fresh and thematically rich. Avoids cliché in its portrayal of rebellion through subtle acts. However, phrases like "therapeutic prison" and "coded messages" flirt with overused dystopian tropes without fully transcending them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution. The brevity forces sacrifices—colonists’ mobilization feels rushed—yet the fusion of defiance and hope creates lingering resonance. Some assigned components (e.g., "forcibly gentle") integrate better than others (the beehive's structural significance).</comment>
