<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's grief is palpable through symbolic interactions (collar, song) but lacks visceral internal conflict; motivations are implied through action rather than deeply explored psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical meandering creates emotional coherence but not traditional plot progression; circular structure and resonant ending compensate for minimal narrative arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Abandoned chamber’s shattered dome, celestial geometry, and tactile details (collar warmth) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that mirrors emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thematic depth (silence as presence, memory as vibration) elevates poetic imagery; underdeveloped conflict between science/art weakens overall impact slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., “celestial geometry,” “spaces between sounds”); near-purple prose restrained by emotional authenticity and tonal consistency.</comment>
