<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but transformation feels underdeveloped; contrition drives the plot but nuanced reactions to revelations are minimal. The "living script" revelation lacks emotional resonance despite strong thematic implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing is brisk but resolution feels abrupt; beginning/end connection exists but relies on exposition rather than earned epiphany. Plot mechanics hinge on convenience (e.g., tattoos revealing truth via mop wringing).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating island spa's surreal elements (rigid corpses, shifting tattoos) create vivid atmopshere but underutilizes sensory details beyond visual whimsy. Floating drownings concept lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracked lens, living script) elevate the theme; memorable visual invention and ironic reversal of "successful failure." Ending lacks emotional weight despite clever subversion of vengeance tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some phrasing borders on quip-heavy anachronism ("magnificent fool"). Subtext about power/identity is present but surfaces bluntly rather than through layered storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Concept cohesion is strong but execution lacks depth in critical transitions; constrained length works for twist economy but sacrifices emotional payoffs. Lingering question about "kindness freeing" remains underexplored.</comment>
