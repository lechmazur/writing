<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented identity is conveyed, but motivation shifts between stealing Mira's dream and self-preservation feel underexplored; mathematical challenges are shown but not deeply tied to character's decisions or emotional state</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression from fragmentation to momentary wholeness exists but lacks clear cause-effect chain; thunder resolution feels earned yet plot mechanics remain underdeveloped within the tight word count</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Treehouse decay and post-apocalyptic setting create strong atmosphere, but strained connections between "last human" context and immediate actions; sensory details (humidity, crackling album) excel despite structural weaknesses</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent imagery (shattered photos as psychological fragmentation, thunder as cohesion metaphor) elevates; cohesive theme of seeking wholeness emerges organically; ending achieves paradoxical closure/ambiguity</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream thief concept feels fresh, but "mathematically challenged" strains believability; some flowery transitions ("walls sweat") border on purple prose; tone consistency in depicting mental unraveling/resolution is effectively maintained</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds structural execution; elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under word limit; haunting emotional core lingers despite narrative brevity</comment>
