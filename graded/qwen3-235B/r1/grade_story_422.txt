<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Core traits (muteness, ventriloquism) establish strong identity, but fractured family backstory lacks development. Motivation to archive is clear but emotional stakes remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong circular structure with dawn-to-dawn framework, but payphone call pacing feels contrived. Resolution hinges on underdeveloped fry cook intervention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent sand and parallel moons create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details unevenly distributed. Tone of euphoric agitation inconsistently maintained through emotional heaviness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (coffee sleeves as relics, lighthouse advice) elevate theme, but character emotional growth relies too heavily on told statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original use of parallel universe conceit with concrete details (grease types, hail measurements). Some phrasing ("euphoric agitation") feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Packs multiple complex elements into tight structure while maintaining thematic coherence. Subtle layering of weather metaphors and family dynamics creates lingering resonance.</comment>
