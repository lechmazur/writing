<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mainly strong motivation and internal conflict, but transformation from nervousness to resolve feels slightly rushed without deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within the word limit; pacing is tight but logical, with only minor abruptness in portal activation sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details (bioluminescent smog, bacterial lamps) and setting motifs (mechanical decay interwoven with organic life) create a cohesive, immersive dystopian atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "dissonant notes between fear and motion" deepen theme; ending resonates with poetic closure but slightly over-explains the protagonist's epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through bacteria-tech fusion, but some phrasing ("raw, wild, alive") risks romanticized escapism; emotional subtext is nuanced but occasionally under-showed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole despite brevity; the paradox of bioluminescent decay symbolizing both oppression and transcendence lingers powerfully.</comment>
