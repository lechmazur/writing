<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's shyness underdeveloped; motivation to find beauty clear but inconsistently tied to her stablehand identity. Her agency feels underexplored despite pivotal actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but suffers compressed pacing. The film club structure creates artificial segmentation. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ruined ship and spectral vision merge beautifully. Sensory details (moldering ledgers, warped light) masterfully build atmosphere that directly supports thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lingers hauntingly on memory's power. Subtle symbolism (cracked mirror as narrative throughline) and layered metaphors elevate the craft. Ending resonates thematically rather than sentimentally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh subversion of "chosen one" tropes through salvaging joy rather than fighting evil. Lyrical prose avoids ornamentation; emotional restraint prevents mawkishness. Shows technical sophistication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Element integration mostly seamless, though film clubs feel imposed rather than organic. Brevity enhances melancholic tone. The concept of "repairs through reclaimed memory" provides lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
