<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (Elias’s pursuit of cosmic knowledge vs. scholar’s protectiveness) are clear but lack emotional nuance; dialogue reveals intellect over humanity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with thematic coherence; concise form enhances urgency; lingering questions about ethics of survival through stolen ideas.</comment>
