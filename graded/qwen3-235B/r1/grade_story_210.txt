<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; Elias’ amiable traits are passive, not actively shaping decisions. His transformation feels implied rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in key transitions (visions, resolution). The crossword mechanic drives the arc effectively, but the climax’s emotional payoff lacks buildup within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (salt, creaking timbers, shadows) anchoring the haunted lighthouse’s tone. The setting’s historical weight enhances mood, though temporal cues (waiting room metaphor) feel less integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (crossword/ship parallels) and thematic resonance (old bones bearing new light) create impact. Pacing hinders deeper emotional investment, but imagery and symbolism elevate the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (ghost ships, vision-inducing artifacts). Language is purposeful but occasionally overwrought (“spectral applause”). Subtext enriches themes without feeling derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends elements into a concise arc, with a lingering thematic question about myth vs. modernity. Some forced integration (e.g., timeframe’s metaphor) slightly undermines polish.</comment>
