<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation tied to guilt and silence is poignant but lacks nuanced backstory development; reliance on symbolic props risks oversimplification of inner turmoil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained through sensory motifs, but the pivotal jump feels abrupt; pacing uneven in balancing exposition with climactic action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>World-building excels via prismatic lake and decaying playground imagery, though some symbolic connections between settings and character psychology remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphors like "shadow-flock" and sensory immersion; thematic focus on unsaid words is powerful but occasionally undercut by slightly over-explained closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements interweave thematically but could better exploit brevity as a stylistic strength; some components (e.g., "modest extravagance") feel conceptually undercooked.</comment>
