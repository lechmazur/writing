<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arc is compressed; motivations plausible but underdeveloped. Distinct voice exists, but emotional layers lack depth. "Outlaw" and "poet" traits influence actions but aren't fully leveraged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circular structure with three rehearsals shows progression, but climax feels rushed. Cause-effect between dice and weaponized dome is clear yet underexplained. Pacing balances economy with tension, losing some momentum in final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evocative juxtaposition of steampunk precision and mystical elements. Sensory details immersive (oil scent, clattering dice), but coffee shop/observatory connection feels forced. Atmosphere sustains tonal contrast but lacks thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twist subverts cosmic alignment trope effectively. Dialogue sparse but sharp. Holographic destiny metaphor demonstrates rather than stating meaning, though emotional impact diluted by rapid resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept fusion (cowboy poet/x-steampunk device) avoids genre clich√©s. Some descriptors border on ornate ("saturated ambivalence"), but no formulaic patterning. Subversion of "weaponized astronomy" trope feels fresh but underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite element density, though coffee shop walls feel tacked on. Story feels like deliberate brevity showcase rather than narrative necessity. Lingering theme of epistemic control resonates, but emotional stakes remain thin.</comment>
