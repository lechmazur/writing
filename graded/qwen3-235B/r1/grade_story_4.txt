<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; Seraphina's role as divine conduit lacks emotional depth despite consistent actions. No substantial internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, tightly paced arc with logical cause-effect despite tight word limit. Sudden wind-related resolution feels slightly abrupt but thematically consistent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ink of nightshade, singing ferns) create immersive, surreal atmosphere. Timeless greenhouse setting masterfully amplifies cosmic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and layered metaphors elevate text, but lacks profound thematic subtext. Ending resolution feels satisfying yet risks preciousness through excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original mythopoeic universe avoids genre tropes; occasional overly-elaborate metaphors border on decorative. Emotional beats shown through action rather than stated, maintaining stylistic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional stylistic cohesion across fantastical elements; theme of creative impermanence lingers. Slightly diminished by minimal character interiority within brief scope.</comment>
