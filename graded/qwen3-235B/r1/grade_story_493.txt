<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's prudent nature and cheerfulness are present but underdeveloped; motivation for ancestral pursuit is clear but depth of emotional connection lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from letters to throne room discovery, but the ending's abrupt transition to the chamber resolution feels rushed despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich fusion of ancient/modern settings with vivid sensory details (lichen columns, train roars) creates atmospheric tension but underexplores cultural-mythic implications of Minoan elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (binder rings as throne components) and theme of ancestral responsibility elevate the narrative; dialogue minimalism slightly weakens emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic genre tropes through inventive Minoan/SF hybrid; occasional ornate phrasing ("smudged postscripts of dead relatives") risks purple prose but mostly maintains stylistic purposefulness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity (ancestry as responsibility vs. power) with strong core concept, though some plot mechanics (guardian girl's origin) remain underexplained.</comment>
