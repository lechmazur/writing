<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's duality as warrior of fractures vs. consort's structure is compelling, but emotional depth feels surface-level; "timidly bold" shows in actions but lacks nuanced inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within word limit; cause/effect for cosmic seal rupture could be clearer, but progression from quiet destruction to starsong fulfills arc requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory alchemy of fungal decay and cosmic forces creates immersive atmosphere; luminescent slime constellations and frozen music particularly striking as environmental character.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with cosmic sacrifice framework but occasionally stumbles into ornate abstraction ("language of creation"); maintains stylistic unity amidst conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like fungal orchard and wind chimes form organic architecture for theme, though dream journal's role feels partially schematic; compressed format enhances mythic brevity.</comment>
