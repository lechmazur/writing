<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's borderline immortality and grief are vaguely contextualized, but motivation to restore ecosystems lacks visceral specificity beyond poetic metaphors; emotional reactions feel secondary to atmospheric worldbuilding rather than organic personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Launch action provides structural backbone through technical/aesthetic fusion, but rapid progression from sketching to cosmic transformation strains cause-effect coherence; ending feels more like a thematic flourish than earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite, synesthetic worldbuilding—bioreactor ink, magnetic fungi, poisoned soil—creates immersive decay-revival tension; atmosphere directly informs both character motivation and plot mechanics through tangible, symbolic details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stunning imagery and metaphoric density (e.g., "chlorophyll and quark hybrid") elevate craft; some emotional beats (sacrifice of earbud, lover's voice in wood) resonate, though thematic weight about history's erasure occasionally overwhelms character intimacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through sci-fi eco-surrealism, but phrases like "air crackled" and overreliance on "bitter laughter" border on boilerplate; metaphors (stitching life from entropy) innovate while maintaining accessible emotional anchors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into conceptual mosaic—each assigned piece essential to the story's atomic-ecological metaphor, though some (earbud cover) function more as symbolic props than organic extensions of character or setting.</comment>
