<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's portrayal as a "reckless hunter" is undercut by her meticulousness; her father's legacy drives her more clearly than her stated motivation. Some nuance in her arc (embracing vulnerability) feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect in the ghosts' revelation but rushed in her internal conflict's climax. Pacing mostly efficient, yet the atomization's execution lacks tension despite emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lushly rendered atmosphere with visceral sensory details (burnt sugar, rusted popcorn) that immerses in decay. Mist/shadow contrasts with spectral vibrancy, enhancing thematic duality of joy vs. rot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "supernova of release" carry symbolic heft; the ending elegantly reframes her role as a "scribe of thresholds." Subtext on legacy vs. self-determination resonates, though some exposition via the musician weakens it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with original ghost lore and the lens's mystical function. Dialogue edges into lyrical abstraction but retains emotional authenticity. Occasional ornate phrasing ("clawing at the mist-shrouded pines") risks pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel strained by word-constrained execution; the ending's thematic closure works, but tighter thematic unification of "recklessness" and "wisdom" would strengthen impact.</comment>
