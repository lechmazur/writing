<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Characters are distinct but motivations (nostalgia vs. sarcasm-turned-secret-grief) lack nuanced internal conflict; their dynamic feels sketched rather than fully felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves logically but compression flattens key transitions (e.g., Veyra's confession's emotional weight feels underserved by its delivery method).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding: dark matter winds, asteroid-hardened junipers, and the ship's biome create a vivid, hauntingly specific mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Profound thematic layering (memory, migration, rebirth) elevated by visceral imagery and dialogue that reveals, not states. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radically original concept execution; avoids AI-clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "affectionate thistle") and emotionally complex character beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements serve a cohesive vision of loss and renewal; word limit enhances mythic brevity while leaving lingering questions about Earth's fate.</comment>
