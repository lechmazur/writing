<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt is clear but underexplored; motivations hinted at but lack psychological complexity beyond surface penance tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but relies on cryptic exposition; the rosebush/door causality feels underdeveloped despite tight pacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("cobblestones sparking guilt"), but some overused tropes (historians as truth-keepers) and stylized prose occasionally undermine gravity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competently integrated elements with lingering thematic questions, though high-concept framework risks vagueness over emotional authenticity.</comment>
