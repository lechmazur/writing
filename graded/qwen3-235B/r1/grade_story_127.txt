<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to atone for past cowardice is clear, but internal conflict lacks layered complexity; actions align with guilt but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compact arc exists (silence → memory → confrontation → truce), but pacing feels compressed; cause-effect between gauntlet and truce is logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge’s sensory overload contrasts beautifully with underwater cathedral’s eerie stillness; atmosphere masterfully reinforces guilt and redemption motifs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (rust/ash, coral/brine) elevates theme of reconciliation; truce ending is poignant but slightly diluted by abrupt mechanical orchestra return.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through marine-steampunk fusion; metaphors are fresh though occasionally overwrought. Emotional subtext implied but risks abstraction over authentic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into cohesive narrative but lean on atmospheric scaffolding rather than organic character psychology; compressed form works thematically but sacrifices nuance.</comment>
