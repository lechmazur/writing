<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conceives a motive (rewriting history) but lacks nuanced psychology; actions align with traits yet feel archetypal rather than humanized. Plush's symbolic function is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive through explosive action, but compressed arc leaves emotional stakes thin; cause/effect logical but pacing strains believability at key moments (e.g., librarian's abrupt hesitation).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich in bioluminescent specifics (coral gurgles, ink-dissolving scrolls) but tonal whiplash between "humorous solemnity" and grim violence feels disjointed; some details serve aesthetics over narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (morality as mirror, history as coral) elevate; poetic voice impresses, but themes of subjectivity are explicit rather than subtly dramatized; ending lacks narrative surprise despite circular structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in "revisionist hydraulics" concept, yet over-reliance on stylized descriptors ("hollow-eyed plush") and ironic reversals risks feeling mannered; emotional beats often stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a provocative whole, though thematic clarity sacrifices psychological complexity; length serves conceptual satire but undermines emotional weight; lingering as a darkly clever allegory.</comment>
