<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rationale for choice is clear but underexplored. Internal conflict feels compressed due to word limit. Shared love for food creates connection but lacks gradual development. Voice lacks differentiation between narration and character interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong conceptual arc, but pacing falters during ancestral revelation. Resolution feels somewhat abrupt given the complex setup. Action-driving elements (artifact, sacrifice) are coherent but could better integrate with minor characters.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally distant. Sensory details (cardamom, glyph-knife) enhance mood but insufficient tactile engagement with the "canyon's" spiritual weight. Timeframe integration with generations feels more symbolic than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (baking as creation/destruction, flawed perfection) elevate narrative. Subtext about legacy vs. compassion resonates. Ending successfully reframes initial premise but could deepen emotional payoff through character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subverts mythological tropes effectively with culinary motif. Some phrasing ("feast of the perfectly flawed") borders on overly-ornate abstraction. Avoids excessive clich√©s through unique fusion of sacred and domestic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Creative integration of elements with minimal superfluous content. Tight word economy maintains momentum. Ending crystallizes thematic tension while preserving narrative mystery. Lingers as conceptual artifact rather than mere plot delivery.</comment>
