<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters show surface motivation but lack nuance; Kael's transformation from bitterness to selflessness feels abrupt despite brief hints at deeper backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing is tight with logical cause-effect, but the ending feels slightly rushed in emotional payoff despite effective circular structure from pawned pin to repurposed beacon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with gritty neon/damp contrasts and visceral details ("acidic rain, smog-skies"), though time framework (post-storm) has minimal narrative impact beyond mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("rose in fire", "current to ride") and tactile imagery elevate craft; ending offers philosophical weight but struggles with balancing poetic language against urgent action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through specific details (marble-based navigation, sonic-activated hatpin) but exhibits occasional uneven nuance in emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively: marbles, pin, setting all serve theme; story feels intentionally concise but lacks deeper exploration of Kael's backstory potential.</comment>
