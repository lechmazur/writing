<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s cynicism and curse are integral but lack layered exploration of internal conflict. Motivation is clear but evolution feels overly streamlined. Dialogue reveals traits effectively, though voice occasionally veers into generic bitterness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently through the tapestry’s revelations, but the curse’s stakes are underdeveloped. The ending’s transformation feels abrupt despite the tight word limit; cause/effect between admissions of fear and petrification could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich details (moonlight “crystallizing,” rollercoaster as skeletal) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere. The setting’s decay mirrors the protagonist’s stagnation, deepening theme. Overly poetic descriptors occasionally undercut authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (tapestry as fate, petrification as change) and symbolic growth resonate. Ending suggests reflection but leans on clichéd “seeds in barren soil” imagery. Tone shifts feel earned, but emotional subtext could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Deftly blends mythic elements with modern decay; some phrases (“silk-cut smile,” “threads blushed gold”) feel overpolished. Subverts “cynic’s redemption” trope with discomfort over easy answers. Occasional generic descriptors (“renewed song”) dilute originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around theme, though “bird watching” and lunar phases feel tacked on. The curse’s logic and tapestry-driven resolution elevate cohesion. Lingering thematic resonance balances minor structural fissures.</comment>
