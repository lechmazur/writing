<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations lack depth; the gardener’s emotional arc feels implied rather than fully realized. Her assigned quietness and emotional decoding role aren’t deeply woven into her choices or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has structural coherence but feels compressed. Key transitions (e.g., introducing the translator’s backstory) lack nuance, and the silent retreat’s significance is underdeveloped, weakening the narrative’s momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evoke the setting’s sensory details (lavender, oak) but the “Universal Translation Center” concept is superficially realized. Atmosphere leans on clichéd melancholy without fully integrating with the story’s emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic gestures (e.g., stitched memories) elevate the prose. Themes of nonverbal communication resonate, but emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing (“tangled and persistent as wisteria roots”). The silent retreat and translation themes are imaginative but not wholly subversive of genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s tight word count constraints reveal uneven integration of elements. The central metaphor lingers, but the narrative’s brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of its most intriguing concepts (e.g., translation as emotional labor).</comment>
