<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's grief and determination are clear, but the "cardsharp" trait is underexplored beyond implied pragmatism. His sister's ghost adds emotional stakes but lacks depth beyond serving as a moral counterpoint.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight structural coherence with ritual as the driving force. Coffee-cooling timeframe innovatively dictates pacing, though the specter's sudden intervention strains cause-effect logic slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, visceral atmosphere created through sensory details (inkwell's "liquid onyx," skeletal driftwood) seamlessly interwoven with themes of decay and obsession. Setting functions as active participant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Writing exhibits masterful control of poetic imagery and symbolic resonance (inkwell as grief's physical manifestation). The endingâ€™s emotional heft lingers, though some metaphor density risks distancing readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional resurrection mechanics (dream cameos) and precise, memorable phrasing. Minimal purple prose but occasionally over-relies on adjective-heavy atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion despite constraints. Every element serves dual roles in plot, theme, and character, with concise economy that feels intentional rather than restricted.</comment>
