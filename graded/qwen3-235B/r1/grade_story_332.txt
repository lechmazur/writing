<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s solitude and painter identity shape her introspective yet decisive actions; motivations align with her transformative arc, though her resolve crystallizes abruptly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively, with the notepad’s confessions driving action; pacing is taut yet deliberate, and the beginning/middle/end resolve with poetic logic despite the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric garden is rendered with visceral sensory detail (oxygen hums, jasmine-static air) and tone balances intimacy and cosmic awe, though the “borrowed books” timeframe feels underwoven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance via subtext (sacrifice, memory) and lyrical imagery; ending is haunting yet satisfying, with themes of symbiosis and legacy woven through action/showing rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (“veins of the garden,” “pulsing roots”) and nuanced emotion; occasional ornateness risks veering into purple prose but largely serves the ethereal tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich narrative; the fusion of painting, memory, and cosmic mystery feels purposeful, leaving a lingering metaphysical impression without overexplaining.</comment>
