<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations and traits are present but underdeveloped. Milo's role as a ghost-seeing mechanic isn't fully integrated with his emotional arc. His "elegantly clumsy" trait surfaces in key moments but lacks consistent influence on his behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through staking out tours and resolving the ghost's lingering, but the word limit strains cause/effect clarity. The thematic arc about silence and liberation resolves neatly, though the carnival backstory feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details ("salt-scented mist," "static-shrouded laughter"), and the drowned carnival lab creates haunting cohesion. The setting's connection to the ghosts' unresolved trauma strengthens the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story excels in poetic symbolism (flower crowns as memory, silence as both absence and revelation) and subtext about preservation vs. release. The ending's thematic resonance elevates it, though the conflict resolution leans slightly convenient.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Purely original elements (sand castle lab over drowned carnival) avoid clich√©s. The blend of mechanical and spectral elements feels fresh. No overwrought prose; emotional nuance emerges through action (e.g., dissolving crowns) over explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion under tight constraints. Every element contributes to the theme or atmosphere. The brevity amplifies rather than limits impact, leaving lingering questions about memory and closure that transcend the plot.</comment>
