<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thorn’s eccentricity and motivation are vivid but thinly realized; his reactions to the belt’s revelation lack emotional depth despite the surreal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves briskly but relies on dense, sometimes jarring cause-effect leaps (e.g., UV film igniting Sanskrit smoke); structure is cohesive but strained by high-concept collisions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Mist, ozone, and flickering screens create visceral atmosphere, but the setting leans on exoticized tropes (high altitude, Shangri-La) with minimal cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Vivid metaphors ("digest time itself") and a haunting twist ending elevate the story; themes of inherited obsession linger, though emotional resonance is undercut by tonal excesses.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Originality shines in blending botany with film archeology, but stilted phrasing ("fickle loyalty") and overcooked descriptors (e.g., "capillaries to light") hint at formulaic habits.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere through audacious invention rather than thematic inevitability; the brevity amplifies surreal momentum but leaves some threads (e.g., tea house patrons) underexplored.</comment>
