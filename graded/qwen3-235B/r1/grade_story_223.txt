<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped traits (seasickness) inconsistently shape motivation; emotional drivers (father, brother) hinted but lack depth. Awkward charm feels surface-level, disconnected from core choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Action drives plot effectively, but moon phase tracking lacks causal clarity. Pacing feels rushed in pivotal moments; thematic resolution with mirror lacks necessary build-up within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details evoke nostalgia. Crystal fortress’s symbolism aligns with themes but connections to character’s past feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., “mirror that remembers”) create memorable impact. Subtext about truth/repression is strong but emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original merging of maritime myth and surrealism avoids clichés. Some phrases (“burnt sugar and regret”) risk overwrought stylization; tone remains consistent despite complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central metaphor but constrained by brevity. Concept’s elegance isn’t fully realized within word limit; lingering questions about transformation’s cost lack resolution.</comment>
