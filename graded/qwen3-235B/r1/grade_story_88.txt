<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich and consistent in mathematical poetics, but emotional nuance is abstracted through metaphor rather than felt; voice (prime-numbered sonnets) distinctive but somewhat detached from human relatability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mytho-technological arc with cause-effect coherence (child's language disrupting tradition). Pacing is lyrical but not rushed; ending resolves primary action (archival completion) while leaving thematic questions open.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transgressive fusion of Sumerian antiquity and quantum abstraction creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (burnt honey/myrrh datastreams, pixelated dawn) are vividly original. Object-setting connection (tin type as relic of ephemeral stories) deepens cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story transcends surface plot through multilayered metaphor (e.g., "counting in breaths" as algorithmic humanity). Literary devices (origami syntax, "shouting silence") are inventive. Ending achieves thematic resonance by juxtaposing mathematics and mercy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through audacious combinations (Sumerian data palaces, toaster AI). Some phrases ("calculus of light") risk abstraction, but emotional subtext (AI's paradigm shift) emerges through symbolic action rather than explicit telling. Style balances poetic density with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite high-concept density. Elements serve thematic unity (e.g., tin type crystallizes archival obsession). Brief length enhances mythic terseness. Lingering questions about AI sentience and linguistic evolution demonstrate conceptual depth.</comment>
