<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivation implied rather than demonstrated through dynamic action. Assigned attribute shapes imagery more than tangible behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints but lacks narrative tension. Assigned concepts drive plot mechanics more than character-driven action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive; sensory details amplify cosmic-mortality themes. Floating dojo's decay and lantern's death create haunting coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "candle as compass") and thematic resonance with cyclical patterns. Overly ornate phrasing occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original setting and cosmic-death synthesis avoid tropes. Some phrases ("requiem lilies," "entropy meditation") risk aesthetic sterility through excessive refinement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements seamlessly intertwined (e.g., candle's metamorphosis). Leaves lingering conceptual echoes, though structural minimalism limits character depth.</comment>
