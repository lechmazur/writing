<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marisela’s academic background shapes her conflict with tradition, but her “free-spirited” label feels underdeveloped; her motivation (mending shame) is clear, but her internal logic occasionally leans on abstract introspection over nuanced human behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear progression from despair to renewal, but the compressed arc relies heavily on lyrical abstraction; pivotal moments (finding the letter, polyp blooming) feel slightly rushed despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Breathless, salt-scorched atmosphere immerses readers; sensory details (mother-of-pearl, microbial hymns) merge science and folklore seamlessly, creating a hauntingly tactile, liminal space where memory and ecology collide.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (doubt as rhythm, coral as hymn) deepen theme; the ending transcends sentimental uplift by framing hope as an inherited language. Subtext about bridging disciplines elevates the narrative beyond environmental allegory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No formulaic tropes; linguistic precision avoids overwrought phrasing. Nuanced interplay of shame/hope feels human, not archetypal. Occasional ornate lines (“microbial hymns”) risk artifice but serve the story’s mythic undertone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive meditation on legacy; brevity feels intentional. The interplay of doubt and tradition lingers, though the resolution’s elegiac certainty slightly softens the story’s intellectual edge.</comment>
