<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (stir hearts) and identity (meandering bard) that shapes actions, but lacks emotional depth beyond archetypal role. The use of dentures reveals purpose but not inner conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through puppet show as narrative engine, ties beginning/end via seeds-to-growth motif. Pacing feels slightly rushed but maintains coherence in constrained word count; cause-effect between the cracked dentures and lingering warmth is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Granite mountain/bookstore and seedy bar settings are vividly rendered with sensory details. The labyrinthine architecture mirrors thematic "cracks" where stories erupt. Timeframe (emotional hesitation before apology) enhances atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evokes lingering emotional resonance through metaphor (cracked teeth holding light) and subtext (revolutionary legacy's fragility). Strong use of symbolism and lyrical prose elevates beyond surface plot; ending ties theme of thawing to character motivation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions and predictable emotional cues. Metaphors (e.g., "sapling through concrete") feel fresh. Some ornate phrasing but purposeful for tone; no jarring tonal shifts. Subversive puppetry concept innovatively combines with revolutionary artifact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>ELEMENTS ARE INTERTWINED (e.g., dentures enabling warmth, labyrinthine setting enabling bard's journey). Style serves atmospheric depth. Brevity emphasizes thematic focus over extended narrative; leaves evocative afterimage of thawing emotional frost.</comment>
