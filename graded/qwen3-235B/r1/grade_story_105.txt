<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional nuance lacks depth; her actions align with her desperation to prove her theory, but internal conflict remains underdeveloped beyond surface resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but occasionally rushed; the diaries and shell drive key moments, but the resolution's metaphysical shift ("stitching dawn") feels abrupt despite coherent thematic throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (ozone, fractal light, damp walls) immerse readers; the witch's garage and corridor contrast mystically, though the restroom's relevance to the diaries' hiding spot is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical use of light/darkness and soul mirroring; the ending's "frantic peace" lingers emotionally. Prose is lyrical without excessive ornamentation, though the "stitching" image borders on abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original concept (carpets as magic-source) shines, but phrases like "kaleidoscopic light" and "ozone-lavender" scent risk cliche. Emotions like grief are shown through actions (clutching shell) but sometimes underscored by stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces around theme of temporal darkness, with elements serving narrative cohesion. The brief length amplifies urgency, though the diaries' backstory feels slightly truncated.</comment>
