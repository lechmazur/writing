<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character defined by "strongly weak" trait, but motivation (delivering the ink pot to prevent catastrophe) remains functional rather than deeply interiorized; reactions to the ink pot reveal some inner conflict but lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Delivery deadline drives plot momentum effectively; cause/effect of shattered ink pot reshaping courage follows logically. Arc compressed but coherent. Pacing uneven in spots but overall tight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vibrant sensory fusion of ancient/techno elements (VR mourners, holographic shamans) creates immersive paradox. Atmosphere directly enhances theme of tradition/innovation tension; tone/perspective consistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (strands, mutated courage) provoke reflection. Ending resolves central conflict while leaving thematic questions open. Strong imagery but overreliance on conceptual abstraction dilutes emotional connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh tech-mythos blending. Avoids most clich√©s but contains occasional generic phrases ("roots breaking concrete"). Emotion shown through setting rather than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize into cohesive narrative. Tight constraints embraced as creative force. Leverages brevity for thematic punch rather than limitation. Lingering resonance through metaphorical courage evolution.</comment>
