<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characters demonstrate clear motivation and voice, with Mara’s internal conflict effectively driving the narrative. Subtle showing of transformation through actions and interactions, though some nuances of her past could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc from discovery to resolution, but tight word count occasionally strains the pacing, with some transitions feeling slightly rushed (e.g., ghost’s dialogue leading to revelation).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., peeling clowns, salt air) enhancing mood and theme. The carnival’s decay mirrors Mara’s emotional journey, creating cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact through layered symbolism (amber, exoskeletons) and thematic resonance (legacy vs. self-discovery). The ending’s subtext (“missing the bullseye”) and lyrical prose elevate the craft.</comment>
