<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Shallow characterization beyond stated traits; motivations are intellectually coherent but lack emotional grounding or internal conflict. Actions feel mechanically tied to plot demands rather than organic choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear but schematic structure; key action of animating the DNA drives the plot effectively, but pacing stumbles between conceptual exposition and rapid resolution. The ending feels abrupt rather than earned, with underexplored consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Vivid but haphazard sensory details create atmospheric dissonance. The neon orchard’s cyberpunk elements aren’t meaningfully integrated with thematic or emotional needs—tech-worldbuilding feels decorative rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical foundation and layered subtext about collective shame elevate the narrative. The DNA/hologram/shame parallels are intellectually resonant, though emotional impact is blunted by technical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through linguistic precision and unusual analogies (shame as viral DNA, "prisms of forgotten humiliations"). However, some phrasing ("artificial dawn") leans toward predictable futurism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but inconsistently weighted—brass bell and DNA strand integration outshine underdeveloped setting. The compact frame works conceptually but sacrifices depth in character and consequence.</comment>
