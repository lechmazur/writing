<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's guilt is thematically present but lacks sufficient interiority or nuanced behavior to fully justify his decades-long obsession; motivations inferred more from metaphor than psychological realism. Mentions of drowned mentor are insufficiently developed to sustain emotional gravity of his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through object-as-metaphor structure but struggles with compression—connections between individual yard sale acquisitions feel underexplored, weakening cumulative impact; ending provides sufficient closure while leaving thematic threads too opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting achieves haunting cohesion: shipwrecks, bioluminescence, and salt-damaged orchard create tactile mythopoeia; particularly effective pairing of microscopic star maps with maritime decay to evoke buried memory. Atmosphere occasionally overpowers narrative specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking symbolic architecture (e.g., iron-kelp sapling as synthesis of guilt and growth) elevates story above genre tropes; ending resonates thematically but risks obscurity through abrupt tonal shift from weary to sentimental in final image of customers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery avoids AI-adjacent clichés (e.g., salt isn't mere desolation but "shared wisdom" with maritime history); metaphors like "tides around sunken orchard" resist redundancy within watery motifs. Some phrases border on mannerism without deepening themes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration mostly organic but occasionally self-congratulatory in its own cleverness (e.g., compass/barnacles explicitly "choked" with decay); concision serves mood better than character arc, ending with memorable visual rather than psychological revelation.</comment>
