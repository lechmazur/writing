<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character growth shown through transformation into architect/elegy, but motivations shift abruptly from chronicler to artist; inconsistent emotional nuance in transition</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong cause-effect relationships (thermometer → carnival → bridge) but rushed conclusion; compressed arc works due to tight framework despite thin middle section</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive sensory worldbuilding through acid rain, mechanical birdsong, quartz dust; only minor dissonance in carnival's sudden insertion</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (sculpting as destruction/creation) and thematic resonance around mortality-as-collaborator emerge clearly, though emotional depth feels constrained by format</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes with "practical illusion" and quartz bridge concept, but occasionally slips into excessive ornate description ("groaning chains," "spiderweb cracks")</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite heavy element load; all threads converge around transformation theme, though 7H and fortune-tellers feel marginally under-integrated</comment>
