<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent internal logic weakens motivation; grief is stated but underdeveloped through action. The bard's "doomed" nature remains superficial despite poetic imagery. Reactions to keys and spotlight evasion lack psychological nuance beyond melancholic tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Begin-to-end cohesion strong but constrained by forced mystical resolution. Bell-driven plot mechanics feel abrupt, overshadowing gradual craft preservation arc. Pacing generally effective but climax leans on fantastical deus ex machina rather than character agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details (e.g., "stardust composer," "ink brewed from midnight") create immersive atmosphere. The "raucously silent" studio concept masterfully juxtaposes artistic inertia against digital progress. Spatial descriptions ground emotional stakes through environmental storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liric metaphors (star's birth/craft's death) achieve thematic resonance. The requiem/lullaby duality demonstrates layered meaning. Some emotional beats stated rather than shown; ghostly applause risks sentimentalism. Ending lingers through persistent auditory symbol.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evades many clich√©s with original metaphors (e.g., "tuned to ballads no one wanted to hear") but contains occasional overwritten phrases ("whispering echoes of forgotten artistry"). Character psychology sometimes flattened into poetic abstraction rather than human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve theme but occasionally feel checklist-like (e.g., "forgotten revelry" as literal ghost trope). The star birth timeframe creates compelling tension but underexploited consequences. Writing style maintains consistent melancholic lyricism throughout.</comment>
