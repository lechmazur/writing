<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character’s vigilance and trauma are tightly woven into her obsession with uncovering conspiracies, but motivations occasionally lean on clichéd grief-to-revenge tropes. Her voice is distinct but occasionally over-explained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually tight but feels rushed—key revelations (e.g., decoded coordinates) lack necessary groundwork. Pacing is uneven; the ending resolves too neatly for the complexity introduced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends sterile facility and decaying orchard effectively, with vivid sensory details. However, the temporal anchor of volunteering feels underexploited in shaping the conspiracy’s timeline.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (grief as a lens, apple roots as resistance) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates thematically, but emotional depth is occasionally undercut by overly direct statements (e.g., “madness is vigilance without permission”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids AI-trope predictability with organic fusion of agriculture/spycraft. Some poetic flourishes border on purple prose (“peach pits and vengeance”), but originality and thematic cohesion are strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive and purposeful, leveraging its brevity to heighten mystery. The final image of justice-as-cultivation lingers, though the plot’s mechanistic precision slightly diminishes emotional rawness.</comment>
