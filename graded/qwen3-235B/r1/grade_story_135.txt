<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition as a brewer/linguist is conceptually clear but lacks psychological depth; her reactions often serve worldbuilding over human nuance, though her tactile connection to the caravan and straw adds fleeting humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot mechanics are inventive but occasionally strained (e.g., straw’s hum guiding her); pacing is brisk yet cohesive, with the fissure scene tightening tension before resolving via contrived gear-arm rescue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brilliant sensory fusion of frost and machinery grounds the setting, but the carnival’s abrupt shift from glaciers to cavern feels disconnected; the harbor’s ghostly ambiance overshadows the stakes of the quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (syrup preserving voices) and cyclical structure elevate the theme of preservation; the ending’s emotional resonance (ale with “last sigh”) avoids sentimentality, though some phrasing (“labyrinth of ice”) borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with moss-brewing and linguistic preservation, but occasionally overreaches with baroque descriptions (“aurora’s green pulse”) and a conclusion that feels engineered rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding cohesion is admirable despite the sheer number of elements; the story lingers on linguistic mortality as haunting subtext, though tighter integration of the carnival’s machinery would enhance thematic clarity.</comment>
