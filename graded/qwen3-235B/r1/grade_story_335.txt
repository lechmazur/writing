<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (haunted by past trauma, seeking absolution) is clear but underexplored; "shaky" manifests superficially through physical tremors but lacks psychological depth; voice remains inconsistent between introspection and action</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves through Kael's transaction but feels compressed; cause-effect (amber → meeting → revelation) works but lacks emotional stakes; structure has clarity but pacing stumbles between dense description and pivotal moments</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and original, with sensory details (neon saints, ash, betel-stained teeth) creating immersive decay; time frame adds poetic tension but doesn't fully intertwine with plot mechanics</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong craftsmanship with metaphors (amber as prison, spider as compass); ending achieves thematic closure but lacks visceral emotional punch; themes of memory and redemption are present but could penetrate deeper</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with vivid, original imagery (graffiti constellations, midnight echo) but occasionally veers into ornate description; subtext about wartime guilt and inheritance feels authentic despite familiar tropes</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack narrative urgency; length serves economy over emotional resonance; style elevates premise but thematic payoff stays surface-level</comment>
