<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character shows layered conflict but "bookish" trait remains superficial; empathy as a fatal flaw feels underdeveloped, motivations have nuance but voice lacks distinctiveness</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves with precision despite dense concepts; cyclical structure mirrors thematic repetition but brief pivot to child's perspective risks cohesion; pacing maintains tension through tight word limit</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting rendered through auditory details creates immersive claustrophobia; atmosphere and tone interplay well (mournful elation via static hums, stifled memories) but deeper integration with "frequency monitoring" potential missing</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery of rubber as protective/diminutive facade transcends literal use; cyclical trauma meditation as haunting metaphor for systemic violence; ending vow reveals profound psychological complexity through precise, restrained language</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through visceral philosophical conflict; sensory details precise yet restrained; no machine-generated redundancy in phrasing; emotional subtext ("almost traded mission for child's hope") feels authentic rather than algorithmic</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative purpose but lack organic interconnectedness; compression feels intentional yet some motifs remain undercooked; lingering emotional echo achieved through cyclical ending but broader cohesion slightly uneven</comment>
