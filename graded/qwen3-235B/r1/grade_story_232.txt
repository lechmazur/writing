<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (inscriptions) drives the plot, but lacks emotional dimension beyond professional obsession. Coffee-stained divination reveals eccentricity but feels gimmicky. Voice remains clinical despite first-person potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on contrived coffee-ground epiphany; temple’s transformation into a map resolves too neatly. Pacing stumbles between camp and temple, with underdeveloped setup/ payoff for “dire enchantment.”</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrast between tech camp (solar lamps, coding debates) and jungle (moss, howler monkeys), but fusion of modern/ancient feels superficial. Atmosphere leans on clichéd temple tropes diluted by digital nomad gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery (bioluminescent algae, coffee-stain glyphs) lingers, but theme of “absolution over greed” emerges abruptly. Ending lacks emotional payoff—character’s transformation is implied but not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Balances originality (digital archeology meets coffee divination) with clichés (cursed pirates, glowing wall slots). Avoids purple prose but leans on tropes—e.g., “rumble shook the chamber”—without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements fit mechanically (cutlass connects plot threads) but lack thematic symbiosis. Premise feels like a draft—promising contrasts (tech vs. mysticism) remain underexplored, undermining cohesion.</comment>
