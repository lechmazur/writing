<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Thalia's traits (mystic, flamboyant attire) shape her actions but lack psychological depth; motivation drives plot but feels underexplored beyond surface-level "salvaging ghosts."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Overrides drive momentum; tight word limit strains resolution—a rushed torching diminishes the thematic payoff of "growing" lineage. Plot coherence survives despite compressed arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive (bioluminescent orchid, molten machines) with tone-perfect decay; tactile details (smoke, blood) deepen the mythic-modern clash. Atmosphere outpaces plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-DNA and cyclical extinction pulse beneath taut metaphor; ending lingers with mythic ambiguity. Subtext elevates machinery into elegy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with bio-spiritual fusion; prose leans into ornate phrasing but redeems itself with visceral imagery (phage rewriting code, spores in smoke). Feels human-crafted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Leverages constraints inventively (e.g., hologram ancestors as plot device/theme vessel) but stumbles in execution—the abrupt "tore the lab" finale weakens cumulative impact.</comment>
