<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's death wish and guilt over sister's death are present but underexplored; motivations drive key actions but lack layered psychological depth; internal conflict is compelling but somewhat flattened by narrative's poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot tightly structured around time-sensitive collapse; cause-effect ties to psychic calls and energy maps are coherent but require suspension of disbelief; pacing falters briefly during exposition but delivers satisfying arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Richly immersive with tactile mist, glowing energy flows, and trembling ice; atmosphere amplifies theme of serenity vs. destruction; setting details enhance plot but hidden societies remain conceptually thin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting prose with resonant metaphors ("poison taster," "frozen tears"); ending blends redemption and existential reckoning; emotional subtext (guilt, yearning) is implied through action rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes (weaving energy flows to bind collapse); some overwrought lines ("whispering secrets only the doomed could hear") undercut nuance; sister-reckoning twist feels fresh but risks melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive through thematic linkage of mortality/mendancy; elements serve plot and symbolism (bookmark as both map and relic of survival); length works for immediacy but limits secondary worldbuilding.</comment>
