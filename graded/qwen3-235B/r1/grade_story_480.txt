<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations surface but insufficiently explored. Assigned traits occasionally influence action but lack integration into her core persona. Narrative voice is distinct but inconsistent in purposefulness. Dialogue minimal and somewhat flat.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; some abrupt transitions (e.g., receipt to secret club). Action/method coherence weakened by underdeveloped cause-effect. Resolution hints at larger world but leaves central conflict unexplored. Pacing uneven in tight constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere via vivid sensory details blending decay and eerie vitality. Objects/settings meaningfully interconnected (e.g., receipt as narrative key). Tone balances detached wonder with existential curiosity. Timeframe/setting enhance mood and conceptual themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors/symbolism ("cans of silence," digital vs. raw truth) are evocative with layered meaning. Writing style sharp and precise, avoiding purple prose. Ending achieves emotional resonance through understated revelation rather than exposition. Subtext about mediated experience elevates narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes with inventive concepts (e.g., haunting as archived scream). Sensory details specific rather than generic. Voice remains consistent despite surreal elements. Emotional subtext nuanced, though occasional phrasing ("prickle of being watched") borders clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrated effectively but unevenly prioritized. Brevisity works thematically but sacrifices character/plot resolution. Conceptual ambition evident; style enhances clarity. Leaves lingering thematic questions about authenticity in mediated experiences.</comment>
