<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to break cycles is clear but lacks emotional depth; reactions to masks and mirror hint at inner conflict, but voice remains diffuse despite poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc (desertion to unmaking) but pacing unevenly telescopes key moments (e.g., mask reconstruction); logical gaps in how the "hymn" functions dilute cause-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (chlorophyll whispers, soot, etched glyphs) immerse readers, but "jigsaw puzzles of root networks" feels abstract rather than viscerally integrated into setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirrors, masks, plant cycles) cohere into layered themes; ending resonates as both destruction and rebirth, though subtext occasionally overtaken by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war/trauma metaphors avoids clich√©s; some phrasing risks ornateness (e.g., "carbonized and cracked"), but imagery and tone remain distinctly singular.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story transcends constraints with thematic unity, though brevity leaves some elements (e.g., hymn's mechanics) underexplored; deliberate restraint balances against narrative vagueness.</comment>
