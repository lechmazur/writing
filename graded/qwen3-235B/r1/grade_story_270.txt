<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct cynical voice and motivation to harness the ephemeral, but his emotional arc feels abbreviated. Internal contradiction between arrogance and vulnerability is hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Well-paced progression from isolated conjurer to collective realization, with tight cause-effect logic. The lighthouse-as-metaphor cohesion elevates the structure, though the climax feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eerie nostalgia perfectly matches the theme, with vivid tactile details (dust, cold metal) and spatial awareness creating immersive atmosphere. The lighthouse setting works as both prison and conduit for shared human experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("salt-taste of his first kiss") and layered symbolism. The ending's philosophical weight resonates through subtext rather than exposition, with tension between solitude and connection serving as compelling subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of cosmic and personal themes avoids genre tropes. Sensory details are specific, not generic, with emotional resonance emerging from atmospheric context rather than direct statement. Stylistic flourishes enhance rather than obscure meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements integrate smoothly into theme-driven narrative. The constrained form sharpens focus on core ideas. Lingering resonance from the paradoxical ending suggests depth beyond surface plot. Minor quibbles with character pacing.</comment>
