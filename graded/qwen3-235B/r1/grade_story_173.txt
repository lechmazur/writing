<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's inherited mission and hollow motivation are clear, but emotional depth remains surface-level despite hinting at internal conflict between obligation and autonomy. Voice lacks sufficient differentiation beyond archetypal bitterness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Limited word count efficiently drives single action (route reclamation) with beginning/middle/end structure, but multiverse implications feel underdeveloped. Pacing slightly uneven during temporal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion through brine, silt, and ethereal merchants. Underwater decay contrasts with memory of apricot blossoms, creating potent atmosphere. Multiverse setting could be more viscerally integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "veins as trade routes" and "roots fed by drowned maps" elevate text. Subtext about inherited burden resonates, though emotional beats occasionally lean on "bitter" descriptions rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of multiverse orchardist, ecological archaeology, and grief-as-method. Avoids genre clich√©s while maintaining linguistic precision. Voice avoids AI-like repetition or tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into mythic artifact-reclamation narrative. Brevity focuses on pivotal moments rather than feeling truncated. Lingering questions about cyclical sacrifice emerge organically.</comment>
