<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s mechanically intuitive nature and dice-rolling are tied to his guardian role, but motivation lacks emotional depth beyond duty. Supporting characters underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on dice and equations, with a clear beginning/middle/end in the schoolhouse’s transformation. Pacing is tight but some cause-effect leaps strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges retro-futurism with indigenous motifs effectively. Sensory details (synth-pie, chalk-dust constellations) immerse readers, though setting connections are occasionally vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and layered themes (preserving knowledge, chaos/order) enhance impact. Ending’s cyclical structure is satisfying but lacks visceral emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés; retro-indigenous fusion feels fresh. No purple prose. Logical consistency in character actions and worldbuilding surpasses AI-generated patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive use of elements with inventive synthesis. Brief length is purposeful, hinting at vast lore. Minor integration gaps (diner/schoolhouse link) slightly undercut cohesion.</comment>
