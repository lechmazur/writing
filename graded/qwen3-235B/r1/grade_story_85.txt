<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks nuance in character history shaping motivations despite thematic alignment; internal transformation feels abstract rather than earned through specific emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragmented pacing due to dense conceptual focus; cause-effect between epiphany and actions lacks gradual buildup, though circular structure achieves thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details (stone leaves, amber sap) create immersive atmosphere; slightly undermined by occasional overwrought phrases like "singing in colors older than language."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor system (mirror/schematic, forest rebirth) supports thematic cohesion; emotional impact diluted by dense abstraction rather than visceral showing of transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original concept subverting doomsday trope; occasionally hindered by borderline purple prose ("unanswerable question," "verdant shadows") and overly formal diction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but struggle with narrative brevity's constraints; some conceptual depth comes at expense of emotional immediacy and structural clarity.</comment>
