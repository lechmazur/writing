<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's cunning and internal conflict are evident, but motivations lack layered psychological complexity; dialogue feels slightly performative rather than deeply personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight structure with satisfying cause-effect chains, though resolution feels compressed; connections between prophecy mechanics and character choices could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory worldbuilding with strong atmospheric cohesion, though mystical elements occasionally overwhelm narrative integration; setting enhances thematic weight but risks overshadowing character interiority.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., blankness as existential void) are potent; ending subverts expectations while maintaining thematic unity, though the final philosophical pivot could be more subtly foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive metaphors and unconventional protagonist choices; some phrases (e.g., "silent scream") verge on poetic excess without fully detaching from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven with narrative purpose; brevity amplifies thematic punch but slightly flattens emotional resonance; the ending's conceptual elegance compensates for compressed character trajectory.</comment>
