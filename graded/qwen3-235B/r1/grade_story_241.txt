<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters defined by poetic gestures but lack psychological depth; motivations implied through action rather than internal logic, creating emotional distance despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear progression from blackout to harmonic climax, but the severing of tethers feels abrupt; concept drives plot but pacing sacrifices causal clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere rich in sensory contradictions (bioluminescent fungi vs. scream), but setting's rules remain ungrounded; beauty overshadows functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolic resonance (scream as untamed possibility) elevates surface narrative, but emotional payoff diluted by overly abstract metaphors; ending feels emblematic yet hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original cosmic imagery counterweights faintly formulaic tension/resolution; language occasionally leans on "starchild" mysticism but generally avoids clich√© through precise, kinetic metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a singular speculative vision, but some ornamental flourishes undermine thematic urgency; brevity amplifies melancholic resonance while obscuring structural weaknesses.</comment>
