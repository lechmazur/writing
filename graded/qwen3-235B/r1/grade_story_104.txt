<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's stoic defiance is consistent, but emotional depth thin; dialogue reveals ideological conflict yet lacks raw vulnerability to fully humanize her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tight structure effectively juxtaposes quiet rebellion against decay, but the sudden shift to burning archives feels abrupt despite thematic logic; ending resonates but sacrifices closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion—dust-choked dioramas, green-licking flames, amber dusk—create a haunting palimpsest of decline; every object symbolizes transience yet the setting's timelessness feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (termites as truth, nostalgia as contraband) elevate beyond plot mechanics; ending's visceral symbolism (glowing cameo as dying breath) lingers but risks overwrought pretension in phrases like "lullaby of conformity."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through tactile surrealism—quilted tundras, vanishing names—but occasional flourishes ("scalpel-smile," "confetti ash") verge on conceptual overkill; emotional undercurrents remain implied rather than felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesion thrives in thematic economy—a dying institution as microcosm—but narrative momentum prioritizes atmosphere over character evolution; the premise's ambition stretches tight limits without bursting.</comment>
