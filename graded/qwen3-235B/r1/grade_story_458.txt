<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation tied to the mentor’s button is poignant but underdeveloped; internal conflict is implied rather than explored. The object-driven decision feels emotionally resonant but lacks layered nuance in her characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (dilemma → choice → sacrifice), but transitions between action beats (e.g., AI abruptly activating) feel rushed. The coffee-stain catalyst works, though the wormhole suicide feels narratively compressed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but inconsistently immersive: “fractal sorrow” and “geometric shadows” evoke a haunting tone, but the abandoned baggage claim isn’t fully integrated into the climax (e.g., no spatial stakes). Sensory details feel curated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bridge-as-unity metaphor and thermos-as-symbol are evocative; the ending’s dual focus on sacrifice and legacy is affecting. However, emotional resonance relies somewhat on abstract imagery over sustained character connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some poetic flourishes (“fractured ceiling panels”) enhance tone, but phrases like “death rattle” verge on cliché. Tropes (sacrificing life for knowledge) are reimagined but not subverted. Dialogue is minimal, reducing opportunities for organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize but lack a cohesive thematic anchor beyond “sacrifice for unity.” The brevity sharpens tension but leaves worldbuilding and subtext underexplored. Lingering impact comes from symbolic resonance rather than narrative innovation.</comment>
