<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s role as scapegoat is conceptually rich but underexplored; their transformation feels abrupt despite symbolic gestures. Emotional depth is hinted but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot driven by clear cause-effect chain (calls → refashioning → discovery). Pacing tight within constraints; ending resonates with beginning, though some transitions (e.g., sudden shift to Sky Graveyard) could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative details (smog-clung anvils, corroded dirigibles) immerse readers. Tone of "obsessive calm" is sustained, but Cloud City’s lore feels underexploited despite atmospheric potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong resonance of symbolism (washer/key, reactor as shame). Ending delivers thematic payoff. Subtext about systemic guilt is clear, though emotional impact lacks visceral force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids typical tropes; Cloud City’s blend of decay and surrealism feels fresh. Metaphors precise (e.g., blame-as-currency). No purple prose; stylistic consistency maintains tension despite complex ideas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements integrated cohesively into thematically unified narrative. Short length serves the story’s focus on metamorphosis; ending provokes reflection on identity and autonomy.</comment>
