<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains opaque despite clear motivation; "politeness" isn't meaningfully demonstrated, limiting psychological depth. Minimal dialogue undermines distinctness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Arc is present but compressed, with cause-effect relationships collapsing during time inversion. Pacing balances action with reflection unevenly, particularly in abrupt confrontation with Lira.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (neon vines, crunching crystals) create immersive atmosphere, but setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than shaping character or concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (soundwaves bending reality) elevate storytelling, but subtext about mastery vs. humility feels thin. Ending aims for philosophical resonance but arrives too quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar tropes (time manipulation, betrayal) without sufficient subversion. Some phrases ("whispers in his gloves") verge on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elements incorporated mechanically rather than organically. Style occasionally enhances narrative but uneven sentence-level quality undermines polish.</comment>
