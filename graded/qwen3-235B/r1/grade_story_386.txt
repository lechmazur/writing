<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but emotional depth lacks nuance; traits like "quiet defiance" are stated rather than fully dramatized through layered actions or subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured within constraints: beginning (fracture), middle (star-aligned preparation), end (sacrifice and resolution) are coherent, though the abrupt post-healing transition to her tattoo could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ethereal, haunting atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., "atomic core cast a borrowed dawn") and object-setting cohesion; the decayed lighthouse and paradoxical light enhance thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "memory was a weapon"), lyrical prose, and thematic layers (sacrifice, legacy, cyclical endurance) create lingering emotional and intellectual impact; ending resonates powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original fusion of speculative elements (atom-powered lighthouse, time refugee) avoids clich√©s; evocative, purposeful imagery avoids machine-generated formulaicity, though occasional ornate phrasing risks edging toward purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Each element serves the narrative; brevity feels intentional, amplifying poetic economy; cohesive interweave of theme, image, and character creates a transcendent whole that lingers beyond the page.</comment>
