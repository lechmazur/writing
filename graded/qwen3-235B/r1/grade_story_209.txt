<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character’s grief and guilt are palpable but lack depth in exploring how his rootless life shaped his daughter’s relationship. The hairbrush and revelation about the wife are effective, but internal conflict resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres tightly to a grief-driven quest, weaving tech failure, hidden blueprints, and spectral communication into a cohesive arc. Pacing in later scenes slightly falters with abrupt shifts to resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Radiant sensory contrasts (rusted railways vs. humming antennas) and the eerie tone amplify atmosphere. The abandoned spaces evoke melancholy and rebirth, though some descriptors border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storytelling masterfully employs metaphor (echo decay as grief, radio static as liminality). The ending’s duality—despair vs. purpose—is haunting, with emotional beats shown through objects/actions rather than told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with original elements like the electromagnetic garden and spectral voice. Some phrases verge on ornate (“rusted veins buried beneath thistle”), but emotional subtext feels nuanced, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated; the radio garden and water tower especially elevate the narrative. The brief format enhances urgency, though the spectral voice risks feeling uncanny without over-explanation.</comment>
