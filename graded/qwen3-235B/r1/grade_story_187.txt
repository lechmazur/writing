<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character exhibits consistent resolve and layered motives tied to trauma, though backstory remains intriguingly elusive. Dialogue and physicality convey stoic defiance and urgency, but secondary nuances are sacrificed to brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Circular structure with powerful climax achieves coherence, but the rapid revelation of nightmares as backstory feels compressed. Logical throughline exists between opening tension and rooted floorboard resolution within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery: Mesmerizingly bland void contrasts with pulsing symbols; sensory details like "chalk-dust" and "brittle leaves" create immersive decay. The training ground embodies ritual's fading power, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotive power derives from vivid metaphors ("wool-sheathed blade") and symbolic floorboard evolution. Ending resonates with tragic permanence, though subtext about memory's survival could deepen further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through lyrical yet precise prose; nightmares and map fragment subvert expectations. Some phrases ("hollow eyes galloping backward") risk overabstraction, but overall voice remains uniquely haunting rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements synergize to explore truth preservation: the floorboard's transformation and "necessary lies" are indelible. Brief length enhances ritualistic pacing rather than hindering, though final thematic punch could be more sustained.</comment>
