<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation (learning dream language) drives actions but lacks depth; emotional detachment is consistent yet underexplored. Guardian role's sacrifices hinted at but insufficiently connected to inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc (rumor confrontation, approval), but moon-path tracking's mechanics feel underdeveloped. Pacing balances action and reflection but relies on condensed implication rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with sensory details (hisssing waterfalls, glowing trails) amplifying tone. Fern orchard-worldbuilding rich but slightly indulgent; setting sometimes overwhelms narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic devices (dissonant triads splitting rumors into moths) create vivid resonance. Subtext around sacrifice and fractured truth lingers. Ending elegantly ties theme to imagery, though emotional impact relies heavily on lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of moonlit mysticism and procedural rigor avoids clich√©. Metaphors (constellations as approval marks) feel fresh. Precision in style aligns with tone; no formulaic patterns or emotional shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements fused organically into layered narrative. Short length leveraged for poetic brevity rather than limitation. Lingers in mind via its haunting tension between structure and surrealism.</comment>
