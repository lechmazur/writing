<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's transition from planner to prepper is logical but under-explored. Actions (hoarding, obsessions) align with motivations but lack depth in showing inner conflict. Resolution feels abrupt yet thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot balances past/present cohesively, though the temple discovery's thematic payoff overshadows mechanical plot logic. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in bridging obsessions to epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting immerses through tactile details (cold brass, rot). Atmosphere of decay mirrors character’s psyche. Ancient temple enhances existential dread but lacks cultural specificity in "Indian" context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (vines replacing stars, seed vault as self-parody) elevate theme. Subtext about self-deception is sharp. Ending’s emotional resonance is undercut slightly by exposition-heavy introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids prepper clichés by focusing on intellectual decay. Synthesis of astrological/psychological motifs feels original. Minor purple prose in passages about "venom" and "insisting growth" detracts slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements serve the arc of self-realization. Style balances poetic imagery with sparse realism. Conceptual ambition and emotional payoff justify brevity, though emotional shifts could feel less engineered.</comment>
