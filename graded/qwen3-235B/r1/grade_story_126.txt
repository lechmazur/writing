<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's transformation from merchant to truth-smuggler is clear, motivation to shatter illusions consistent, but lacks deeper psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent ascent/destruction arc, but pacing uneven in mid-section; cause-effect logic regarding the churn's impact feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid decay of the station and synthetic Earth projections create potent atmosphere; sensory details (vacuum, pine scent) immersive but occasionally overly ornate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The butter churn as rebellion device avoids clich√©; some phrases ("cosmic dark") border on poetic excess but generally maintain original voice and purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively; brief length serves as a vignette of collapse, though some thematic layers (aloof passion) feel underexplored.</comment>
