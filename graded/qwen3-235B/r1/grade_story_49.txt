<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative description of lunar decay through tactile details (thread texture, burnt honey taste); achieves haunting sensory cohesion between gravity-loss and emotional dissociation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Assigned elements integrated with inventive cohesion; brevity occasionally sacrifices character depth but amplifies lyrical resonance.</comment>
