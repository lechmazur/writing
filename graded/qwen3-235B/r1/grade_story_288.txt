<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (artistic legacy, freedom) are clear but under-developed; the boy's sudden philosophical depth feels unearned. The blacksmith's 'professionally wild' attribute lacks concrete demonstration beyond symbolic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels compressed; the action (building the dragon) drives progression logically, yet the abrupt introduction of the child-school day connection strains plausibility within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (industrial rain, ozone charts as wings) and the ozone station's decayed grandeur create visceral immersion. The tattered flag's symbolism anchors the setting, though the quarantine zone's hazards remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (fire/freedom, dragon as ephemeral beauty) and lyrical prose elevate impact. The ending's bittersweet thematic completeness ("meek audacity") is potent, though the dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some phrasing ("professionally wild," "meek audacity") risks contrived symbolism. The dragon as artistic legacy concept is fresh, but character dynamics (immediate mentor-child bond) lean on predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant prose and conceptual cohesion are undercut by narrative shortcuts (e.g., insufficient context for the blacksmith's history). The story's thematic ambition exceeds its execution within the constraints.</comment>
