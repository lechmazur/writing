<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to grief and duty is clear, but emotional depth feels abbreviated within the tight word count; reactions align with traits but lack nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong forward momentum from supernatural encounter to catharsis; pacing is brisk but cohesive, though the resolution feels slightly compressed, undercutting emotional gravity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in aquatic utopia with frost, bioluminescence, and tidal rhythms creates haunting atmosphere; some details (e.g., bureaucracy) jarringly underdeveloped in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism—bread box as familial legacy, drum as memory conduit, kelp as both prison and rebirth—elevates theme of confronting grief; ending resonates with quiet transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original fusion of post-utopian bureaucracy with oceanic mysticism; occasional overwritten phrases ("kelp forming a cavern") and slightly mechanical emotional transitions hint at artificial phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven with theme but occasionally strained; brevity enhances urgency while sacrificing secondary character/setting textures, leaving concept slightly unbalanced.</comment>
