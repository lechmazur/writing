<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (scent of noodles, fractal shapes) immerse readers; orbital setting enhances decay theme, though connection to picnics feels tenuous at times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements (coathanger, picnics, postcards) cohere through thematic repetition; concise length serves the story's focus on cyclical patterns and rebirth.</comment>
