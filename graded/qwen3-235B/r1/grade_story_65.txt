<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's slapdash nature is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but not thoroughly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-effect, though the picnic tradition’s abrupt transition from nostalgia to survival feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting’s sensory details (sulfur, trembling cliffs) immerse effectively, but the sacredness of the space feels superficially tied to its perilous location.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés, with inventive metaphors (“geysers of sulfur and whispers”), but some phrases (“unkillable joy”) border on overwritten sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive narrative; brevity enhances urgency, though the theme of “family tradition” could be more deeply interrogated.</comment>
