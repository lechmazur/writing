<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character has physicality and interiority but motivations occasionally feel abstract, relying on thematic statements rather than embodied choices. Voice remains distinctive but under-explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plots through symbolic objects with tension, but some cause/effect connections between action beats lack organicity. Pacing alternates between potent compression and rushed transitions in mid-section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally rendered with mechanical/sensual contrasts, though timeframe's temporal resonance remains underdeveloped despite strong sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Uses recurring motif of "standing" with poetic resonance, but emotional heft occasionally prioritizes abstraction over visceral embodiment of internal conflict. Ending's thematic unity compensates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Contains fresh mechanical mythos but occasionally defaults to metaphor density without grounding in physicality. Emotional subtext sometimes emerges through imagery rather than character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually but execution occasionally prioritizes poetic resonance over narrative cohesion. Brief length serves thematic progression but sacrifices emotional depth.</comment>
