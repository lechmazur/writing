<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (redemption) are clear, but the trait 'meekly assertive' lacks full integration into key decisions. Emotional reactions occasionally feel surface-level despite poignant material.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from oath-breaking to confrontation with Lira, but the ending resolution feels rushed within the word limit. The core conflict is well-shaped but lacks deeper development for secondary beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered (medical bay decay, cosmic indifference), but sensory details occasionally lean generic ('bitter petals') rather than uniquely anchoring the sci-fi setting. Connection between 'humming universe' and human-scale drama could deepen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (gossip columns as truth-dividing tools, brittle flowers as contrition) elevate the narrative. Dialogue is taut but occasionally sacrifices nuance for brevity. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional payoff could feel more earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique combinations (redemption via media sabotage) and restrained prose. Emotional subtext (shame, tentative forgiveness) emerges through concrete actions rather than exposition. Avoids purple prose while maintaining poeticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements serve narrative cohesion, with the tight frame working intentionally to amplify emotional stakes. The brevity enhances, rather than hinders, the story's focus on personal rebirth. Some minor pacing stumbles but overall a polished, resonant work.</comment>
