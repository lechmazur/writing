<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poet's insomnia and botanical obsession shape her attuned perception but lack explicit trauma backstory. Motivations shift organically from fear to reconciliation, but the voice occasionally leans into poetic vagueness over psychological precision.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whisper-driven plot maintains tight arc through subway interval repetitions. Botanist's exposition risks contrivance, but botanical resolution feels earned. Pacing near-flawless in its 500-word sprint, though the "empty abundance" epiphany lands slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory layering (damp soil scent, subway vibrations, ivy's throaty strangling) merges with metaphysical dread to make the attic a breathing entity. Timeframe and setting work synergistically to fracture and heal the narrative space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors operate on multiple registers (colonial theft/psychic haunting/creative guilt) without sermonizing. Final image of jasmine breeze as narrative 'seed' exemplifies poetic economy. The central theme of ethical creation/restitution emerges through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No genre clichés—cemetery ivy poltergeists feel newly mythologized. Dialogue avoids maudlinism, with "bury things alive" line cutting through abstraction. Subtle purple prose risks in amber jars description, but largely restrained. Emotional nuance emerges through soil's somatic agency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements function as organic components of the central metaphor—botanical theft as creative violation. Brief form enhances the motif of fragmentation/apology. The haunting's resolution lingers as both closure and beginning, though secondary characters remain sketches.</comment>
