<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and empathy, but backstory and personal stakes lack depth; motivation is clear but underexplored beyond surface-level duty.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive but compressed; rhythm of key action (mending dove) drives resolution, though pacing feels rushed in conveying emotional weight and spectral dynamics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (dove, heartbeat), emotionally resonant subtext, and lyrical prose; ending slightly underwhelming despite layered thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh twists on haunted setting, though occasional ornate phrasing veers toward purple prose; avoids most AI tropes with nuanced emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements present and thematically interwoven; some—like "steadily free"—feel tenuously connected, but overall demonstrates creative synthesis and lingering thematic weight.</comment>
