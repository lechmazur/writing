<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's dual ties to magic and repair shop are functional but lack deep internal conflict portrayal; motivation for artistic rebellion lacks gradual buildup beyond a single lie.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning/middle/end, but the rapid shift from debt obligation to artistic ambition feels underdeveloped; callbacks lack emotional weight despite strong climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Neo-fantasy setting thrives on sharp sensory contrasts (neon vs. moss) and tactile details of glitchy tech; atmosphere masterfully bridges decay and fragile beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like digital lilies reclaiming chaos and hologram sparrows as failed rebirth symbols add thematic depth; climax's tension lingers in memory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unexpected combinations (VR headsets with moth holes, lunch tins as magical biotanks); self-aware about balancing ornate imagery against purposeful restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element density occasionally strains cohesion (library hours' relevance feels forced), but brevity serves the protagonist's existential pivot point effectively.</comment>
