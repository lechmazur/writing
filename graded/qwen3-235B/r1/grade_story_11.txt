<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has defined traits (flightiness vs. hidden precision) and motivation (legacy), but emotional complexity remains surface-level with underdeveloped tension between anger and serenity beyond stated duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within constraints; trial progression and grid-weaving show momentum. Pacing slightly uneven in middle where alignment realization occurs abruptly without deeper procedural detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion through blurred landscapes, crackling chalk, ink-like robes. Connections between mechanic’s grit and painted storms deepen atmosphere, though secret society lore remains sketchy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "truth as key turning") and theme of seeing-as-creation resonate. Subtext of institutional betrayal vs. inherited wisdom is nuanced, though "serene anger" conceptually simplistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through painterly cartography conceit, but contains ornate phrasing ("clockwork lie") and abrupt existential shifts that strain believability. Emotional resonance more lyrical than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like patch/legacy link feel organic, while "strangely normal" and timeframe concepts strain cohesion. Brief length enhances mythic tone but sacrifices character interiority and societal context.</comment>
