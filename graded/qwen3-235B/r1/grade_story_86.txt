<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's apprehension and exceptional skill inform key actions, but motivation lacks psychological depth beyond surface-level "truth-seeking." Gestures like trembling hands hint at inner conflict but remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression from infiltration to revelation, but relies on conveniences (e.g., candle's dual function). Pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over tight dramatic beats, creating occasional slackening in momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cyberpunk-dystopian atmosphere achieved through vivid sensory details (neon lights, glitching firewalls), but hot air balloons and quasi-mystical "glyphs" create tonal dissonance. "Borrowed dawn" evokes transient hope but integrates unevenly with tech-noir elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance in truth-as-ghost, language-as-liberation themes. Final image of collective awakening memorable, but some metaphors (data "geysers," firewalls as "ossified lies") veer toward over-familiar cyberpunk tropes rather than fresh conceptualization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally lapses into familiar dystopian shorthand (AI sentience, shadowy corporations). Candle innovation and fusion of analog/digital motifs show ingenuity, while "debt passed forward" concept feels slightly pat amidst otherwise complex narrative layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Element cohesion strong in data archaeology premise but strained by balloon-festival integration. Brief length serves thematic compression but undermines character depth. Lingering impression comes from poetic final passages rather than narrative logic.</comment>
