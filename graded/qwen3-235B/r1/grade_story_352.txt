<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak character psychology; motivation (preserving music) exists but reactions to objects lack depth; voice is overwritten, not distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward but ending feels abrupt; the "leaf falling" method isn't fully integrated into the action's logic; pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (constellation dust, rosemary/regret air) create immersive atmosphere; timeframe and setting work symbiotically; rare cohesion in worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("portable sky") and symbolism (dissolving elders) create thematic resonance; ending balances melancholy and hope; tension between preservation/ephemerality masterfully shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s but contains occasional purple prose ("wind-sculpted dune"); metaphors fresh yet occasionally overwrought; emotional nuance somewhat overshadowed by lyrical excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than most but some forced (leaf falling method); style occasionally hinders clarity; brief length works for atmospheric impact rather than structural experimentation.</comment>
