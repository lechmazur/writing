<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's duality as trickster and linguist adds depth but lacks exploration of personal stakes beyond ideological commitment. Reactions to gift tag hint at history but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing strains under word limit; key beats (diversion, planting data) work but transitions feel compressed. Cryptic dares drive action but justification for trust in rivals remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hyper-specific setting details (neon slurry, AI-crop interplay) immersion elevate the world. Atmosphere of fugitive preservation aligns perfectly with ghostly tone and linguistic metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (language as DNA, decay as obfuscation) and cyclical structure amplify thematic weight. Ending circles back to "stretches" to show defiance-as-ritual, though emotional range narrow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Few overly poetic phrases ("brittle husks of genetically modified cornstalks"), but overall originality shines through linguistic bioterrorism concept and subversion of AI "futurism" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>All elements function, but several (rivals' motivations, XÌ±aayda Kil specifics) feel selected for aesthetic rather than narrative necessity. Conceptual brilliance outweighs occasional contrivance.</comment>
