<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but thinly developed; emotional logic in decision-making is shown but lacks deeper exploration of how "blamelessness" or formative experiences shape him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but resolution feels abrupt; cause/effect relationships hold but the escape sequence relies on coincidental sensory guidance rather than earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details and atmospheric contrasts (jasmine vs. mildew, light vs. darkness); however, the subterranean garden’s unexplained existence slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose and symbolic resonance in the final image elevate the story; some emotional beats rely on abstraction rather than visceral “showing,” particularly in character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on genre-typical rebellion/smuggler tropes; poetic imagery occasionally teeters toward ornate abstraction without deepening subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally prioritized over organic development; the final line lingers but the concise format limits thematic follow-through.</comment>
