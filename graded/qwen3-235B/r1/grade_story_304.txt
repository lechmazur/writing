<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Assassin's motivation (unknown prior context) clashes with the driver's self-destructive agency. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite poetic setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure disrupted by abrupt driver death-wish reveal. Spider web motif ties plot together, but climax logic feels contrived within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hyperbaroque asteroid worldbuilding transcends clich√© through sensory-rich metaphors (gargoyle perches, fused quartz roads, spider dewdrops).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density (camera as death ledger, dawn as knife) elevates theme of sacrificial light-bearing. Subtext about artistic burden resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids machine-generated phrases but leans on ornate descriptors. Emotional undercurrents (assassin's trembling, driver's weariness) feel authentic beneath surface stylization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohere through geometric/spatial symbolism but occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity. Left-with a haunting metaphor about creation's cost.</comment>
