<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth beyond symbolic function; motivations are clear but motivations feel abstract rather than human-scaled. Her actions are consistent but don't reveal layered complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure works within constraints but lacks dramatic tension; the arc from first lesson to final class feels compressed. Pacing relies too heavily on summary rather than vividly rendered transitions between time periods.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative but inconsistent sensory immersion; rice-paper windows and charcoal details work, but the castle's reimagined architecture remains vague. Atmospheric tone matches themes but lacks tactile specificity in key moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphorical density connecting natural decay and artistic creation; emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction. The ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept execution but borders on poetic pretension; some phrasing ("whispered psalm") risks preciousness. Avoids tropes but occasionally sacrifices narrative grounding for lyrical effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; brevity feels both deliberate and limiting. Leaves lingering reflection on art/entropy but sacrifices character dimensionality for atmospheric compression.</comment>
