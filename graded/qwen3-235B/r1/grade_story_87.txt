<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character's trauma is visceral and layered, but motivation through buried hatred lacks full psychological complexity; emotional shifts feel earned yet underexplored at key junctures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves emotional arc within constraints, though pacing falters in middle paragraphs; connection between beginning/end is clear but relies heavily on symbolic object repetition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Steampunk elements create atmospheric dissonance effectively, but world-building remains superficial; mechanical details occasionally feel decorative rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (stickers as scars, fire as inheritance) elevate impact; subtext about inherited rage and performative silence resonates strongly through layered imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh symbolic framework avoids clich√© but occasionally slips into overwrought description ("copper veins throbbing in time with pulse"); emotional nuance sometimes sacrificed to lyrical flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central themes but show seams; brevity works overall, though some transitions (e.g., music triggering memory) feel slightly schematic rather than organic.</comment>
