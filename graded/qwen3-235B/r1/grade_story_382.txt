<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's calm certainty is consistent but lacks deeper motivation exploration; dialogue reveals worldview but inner conflict remains nebulous despite poetic lines about flame and decay.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows from discovery to action to symbolic resolution, but the storm-of-roses climax feels abrupt; the 500-word framework strains coherence between abstract imagery and narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory tapestry immerses reader—crumbling library textures, scent of decayed roses, stained glass light—but worldbuilding occasionally leans on overused tropes like "labyrinthine" structures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical weight ("to mourn is to kindle") lingers; dialogue contains poetic truths but occasionally slips into overly cryptic abstraction detracting from emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery balances on edge of beauty/purple prose; avoids clichés through unique combinations (e.g., charcoal phoenixes, sapphire wolves), but atmospheric richness sometimes overshadows narrative substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic spine exists (destruction as revelation), but the balance between poetic abstraction and narrative urgency feels imperfectly calibrated for maximum impact.</comment>
