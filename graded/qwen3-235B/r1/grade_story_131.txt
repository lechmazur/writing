<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stones serve as effective emotional anchors, but character's frost-like aloofness remains surface-level without deeper exploration of isolation's psychological impact beyond metaphorical descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot uses the 'loosen' action effectively to trigger climax, but resolution's thematic leap from cracking the stone to finding the postcard requires more causal logic within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (hovering boxes, light tendrils) create immersive atmosphere; gravitational anomaly's symbolism as emotional weight is evocative but occasionally undercut by overused 'bones'/'mournful' personifications.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones as stolen memories, courage as stranger's coat) provide depth; ending's door/wall juxtaposition effectively shows growth, though social worker's "adapt or perish" feels underdeveloped conceptually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Purposeful literary style avoids clich√©s, but occasional phrases ("snaking toward wrists," "quiet rebellion") verge on formulaic; emotional nuance emerges through kinetic details rather than explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but occasionally mechanically - stones and anomaly tie tightly to themes, while lottery ticket message feels structurally necessary rather than organically earned within narrative logic.</comment>
