<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's sullenness and inherited trauma are evoked through objects, but the transformation feels rushed and psychological nuance is lacking. Motivation ties to ancestral displacement but remains underexplored beyond symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect between stamps/quilt and power station activation, but the underwater city's logic feels contrived. The arc from field to highway is coherent but compressed, with pivotal moments (turbine activation) bordering on magical realism without emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually rich (e.g., "algae-filtered gloom," "cathedral of decay"), but atmospheric dissonance between drought and submerged city weakens cohesion. Sensory details align with "erasing boundaries" theme but over-rely on ornate description rather than character-specific perceptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (quilt as map/compass) and thematic resonance about interconnectedness elevate the story, but explanatory passages ("not to commemorate exiles, but to dissolve separateness") undermine subtlety. The ending's poetic momentum compensates for some telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise with stamps and quilt, but underwater decay and "reanimated reservoir" border on cliché. Avoids purple prose but occasionally lapses into overwrought phrasing ("electricity knitting aquifers"). The "salt of unsent letters" is fresh but under-developed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Idea-rich but structurally uneven. The elements intertwine conceptually (quilt patches ↔ power station corridors) yet strain plausibility. The brief length works for mythic tone but sacrifices emotional payoff. Lingering questions about ancestry lack resolution.</comment>
