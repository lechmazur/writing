<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but insufficiently explored; character's sheepishness doesn't fully integrate with their pivotal actions. Voice remains consistent but lacks multidimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; the resolution arrives abruptly without fully demonstrating the Leviathan's transformation process. Assigned elements drive the narrative but lack deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create a tangible atmosphere; the Pattern Recognition Center's sterile-yet-mystical duality works conceptually. Naptime framing feels underutilized in shaping tension or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (promises as code, scars transforming to sigils) and layered themes (remembering vs. forgetting, bureaucratic apathy). Ending resonates emotionally while maintaining narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through imaginative synthesis of bureaucratic surrealism and ecological myth. Some phrases ("bioluminescent scars") edge toward poetic excess but remain purposeful. Emotional beats emerge organically from actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story achieves remarkable cohesion given density of assigned elements. The naptime setting feels peripheral rather than essential; all other components interlock to create thematic harmony and lingering conceptual impact.</comment>
