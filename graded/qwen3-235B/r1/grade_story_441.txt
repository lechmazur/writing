<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but underdeveloped; her "curious dread" resonates, but the brief length prevents full psychological exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear but cohesive—circular beats (bus stops, stamp exchanges) and a compressed arc from isolation to ghostly connection elevate structural precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stark scientific setting juxtaposed with intimate emotion creates potent atmosphere; sensory details (cold tiles, reactor hum) immerse without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (stamps as absences, lullaby as decay) are haunting and layered; ending avoids sentimentality, leaving resonance in ambiguity about art’s purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending particle physics with diasporic heartbreak; avoids clichés with fresh analogies, though the flash mob risks whimsy but is redeemed by context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synthesize elegantly—each detail (stamps, cassette, equation lyrics) serves dual symbolic and narrative functions while maintaining lyrical concision.</comment>
