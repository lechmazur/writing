<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters show surface motivation through actions but lack depth; Jace's gambling past and Lena's trustworthiness inform key decisions but aren't explored beyond functional roles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows clear beginning-middle-end with cohesive arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing cause-effect relationships between memories, blueprints, and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (CRT flicker, soldering irons, sulfur smells) create immersive atmosphere that thematically ties to memory and entropy but occasionally borders on ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (dice/stabilizer) and emotional tension through subtext; some thematic weight feels slightly explicit rather than fully earned through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains near-tropes ("gambler with hidden heart"); metaphors fresh yet occasionally overwritten, emotional stakes shown but not fully excavated beyond surface resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but not transcendentally; compact structure works for premise with minor tonal inconsistencies, leaving lingering emotional questions rather than thematic revelations.</comment>
