<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's listlessness is hinted through scarred heritage and cynicism but lacks visceral internal conflict beyond abstract longing; motives shift abruptly from "using intention like a blade" to choosing "to choose"—psychological nuance underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a functional mythic arc but feels compressed; the maze's supernatural responsiveness strains credulity, while the crow's sentience birth via flame lacks emotional grounding despite symbolic intent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere lushly merges decay and magic through precise sensory details (burnt thyme, opal eyes) but tonal dissonance between "irony" and mystical awe weakens thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (scarf as lineage, laughter as transformative) resonate; ending subverts intention narratives skillfully; dialogue sharpens character dynamics but some emotional beats rely on abstraction over lived-in detail.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Similes like "serpents" or "gossiping crows" flirt with cliché but are redeemed by inventive details (corn silk gowns, mind-awakening crows); emotional shifts occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story weaves assigned elements into a mythic skeleton but sacrifices depth; length forces thematic shortcuts; final image of revitalized scarf lingers, though character transformation feels conceptually tidy rather than earned.</comment>
