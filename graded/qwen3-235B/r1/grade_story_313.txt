<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a con artist exploiting desperation is clear, but his sudden moment of redemption feels underdeveloped, undermining consistency. His voice is distinct but occasionally inconsistent with his supposed ruthlessness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly compressed but maintains coherence through the ghostly apparitions as a catalyst for change. Begins with moral decay, ends with ambiguous self-sacrifice, but some cause-effect transitions (e.g., widow's sudden recognition) feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully built through specific sensory details (irradiated soil, clicking dispenser) and dystopian imagery. The farm’s decay mirrors Eli’s guilt, but occasionally verges on overdescription.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (tape dispenser as empty promise) and haunting symbolism. The ending’s subtext about confession as makeshift redemption elevates the narrative. Subtle themes of complicity and absolution resonate deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés by interpreting ghosts as manifestations of guilt rather than traditional hauntings. Some phrasing (“splintering wood” laughter) feels overly stylized, but emotional beats (silenced ghosts) are nuanced rather than declarative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion (tape dispenser, ghosts, remorse), though the widow’s abrupt recognition lacks grounding. The brevity never feels restrictive, offering a complete moral arc. Lingering questions about redemption vs. self-destruction enhance impact.</comment>
