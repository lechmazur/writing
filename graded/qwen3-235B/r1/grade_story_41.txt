<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's cosmic powers and factory background intertwine effectively; motivation to break tradition is clear and consistent, though emotional depth in her defiance could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot's rapid progression through pivotal moments risks rushed transitions, but cause-effect logic and closure within word limits maintain coherence; climax feels earned despite compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., "iron and infinity" air, brooch's cold ivory) immerse readers; fantastical terrace contrasts factory realism, though the shift between settings slightly disrupts tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("ordered disarray") and cosmic imagery elevate thematic resonance; ending delivers emotional impact, though subtext about silenced generational trauma remains underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere into an urgent, thematically unified narrative; the brevity serves the story’s intensity, though some stakes feel underweighted due to space constraints; leaves lasting impression of rebellion.</comment>
