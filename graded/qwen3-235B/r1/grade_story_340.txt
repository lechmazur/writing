<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation tied to legacy is clear but lacks deeper exploration; voice distinct but reactions feel surface-level. Action aligns with prideful defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from path collapse to time reversal; pacing uneven but energetic. Resolution feels rushed despite clever time paradox logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transportive sensory details (orchid-dripping architecture, mango-throwing primates) create vivid, thematically resonant setting-worldbuilding symbiosis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Subtext about responsibility-as-compass works; dialogue zings with wit. Ending slightly flattens emotional complexity post-time travel cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors (collagen payment, time's hiccupping clocks) avoid AI clich√©s; tone stays consistent without purple prose excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize (treehouse physics support time distortion logic); concise form amplifies thematic punch rather than limiting it.</comment>
