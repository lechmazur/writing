<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (revenge for sister’s "relocation") is clear and consistent, with the photograph serving as a tangible anchor. However, Kael’s internal conflicts and nuances of his "tense" demeanor remain underexplored despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc—rebellion preparation to decisive action—with logical cause-effect (data chip → broadcast → turnover of power). Pacing is brisk but cohesive, though the climax’s swift resolution of Voris’s downfall feels slightly underserved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (e.g., "glass scarab," blighted orchids) with sensory detail that deepens both atmosphere and thematic parallels (e.g., controlled greenhouse vs. oppressive governance). The lunar context enhances the story’s tension and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "roots knitting through lunar regolith") and symbolism (greenhouse as microcosm of control) add depth. The ending resonates thematically, showing rebirth through action rather than stating it. Some emotional beats (e.g., Kael’s smile) could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original use of tropes (e.g., rebellion via voting/quorum) avoids predictability. Language is purposeful with minimal "purple prose." Avoids AI-like repetition, though the concept of "serendipitously stubborn" feels slightly underwoven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into plot and theme; the confined setting and short scope feel deliberate. Leaves lingering reflections on control and agency. Slightly underdeveloped secondary moments (e.g., security’s shift in loyalty) slightly reduce impact.</comment>
