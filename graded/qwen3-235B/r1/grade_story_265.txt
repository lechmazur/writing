<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Deputy's stoicism conflicts with emotional arc; motivations tied to mystery but psychological depth remains underexplored, particularly her mother's hive-keeping backstory feeling underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot progression through object discovery is logical but compressed; the oil change timeframe creates narrative tension while constraining resolution's emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral, synesthetic descriptions (grease/moss/sweetness) create an unforgettable liminal space where physical decay mirrors metaphysical preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (twist-tie as crown, bees as archivists) deepen thematic exploration of grace, though ending risks sentimentality; subtext about historical erasure resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal intersections (garage/cathedral) and precise symbolism; some phrases border on ornate but generally serve atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically but benefit from expansion; the crystalline interplay of decay/grace/time achieves memorable resonance within formal constraints.</comment>
