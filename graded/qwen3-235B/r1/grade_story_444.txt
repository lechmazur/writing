<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (guilt, redemption) are hinted but obscured by thematic abstraction. Veyra's diplomatic ferocity and maternal grief lack visceral grounding. Dialogue ("Hold this") reveals more about themes than personal psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure driven by temporal shifts feels purposeful but occasionally disorienting. Indoctrination via shared dreams provides momentum, though transitions between eras strain coherence. Ends where it begins, creating cyclical stagnation rather than resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rust-coral atmosphere of the zeppelin amplifies decay and memory. Radio static as temporal liminal space is inspired. Sensory details (gauze clinging like "second conscience") succeed but some settings (trenches, 2076 engineer) remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("comfort is a prison") and layered symbolism (ghost costume as failed protection) elevate impact. Subtext about truth vs. survival resonates, though emotional weight occasionally relies on abstraction over concrete characterization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic AI cadences with striking imagery ("suicide note folded into paper crane"). Avoids purple prose through precise, visceral details. Emotional nuance emerges through action/setting rather than exposition, though occasional ornateness ("hollowed him lighter") risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements interweave to explore trauma's universal residue. The brevity allows thematic compression rather than limitation. Lingering questions about moral ambiguity of Veyra's "salvation" deepen impact without feeling forced.</comment>
