<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's dual identity and motivation are clear, but the "pathfinder" trait isn't sufficiently distinguished from generic secrecy. The teapot fracture creates impactful stakes but lacks earlier emotional groundwork for the lost remedy. Reactions to objects (playlist hacking, hugging teapot) reveal layered skillset but occasionally prioritize concept over psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from eerie inciting incident to climactic teapot destruction, with cause-effect chain tightly maintained despite brevity. The chase through haunted attraction provides satisfying spatial progression. Pacing stumbles slightly during abrupt shift from panic to embracing the grandmother hologram, requiring extra reader inference.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haunted park setting masterfully combines decaying physical elements (creaking rides) with digital supernaturalism (pixelating spirits, holograms). Atmosphere thrives on contrast between clinical data analyst identity and the folkloric setting's organic decay. Sensory details like digitized decay scent and pollen's tactile release create immersive fusion of old/new.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose blends biological and technological metaphors ("subsonic frequencies transmitted through hugs") to explore cultural preservation. Subtext about erasure vs. adaptation resonates through structural choices—fragmentation (teapot, playlists) enabling rebirth. The ending's transformation of public space into healing conduit provides deeply satisfying thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre cliché through precise inventions: playlists encoding medicine, ceramic digitization. Emotional beats shown through physicality (teapot's skin-biting edges) rather than exposition. No purple prose despite ornate concepts—the body-as-language metaphor remains grounded in character's kinetic existence. Minor awkwardness in overly packed compound adjectives ("aloofly passionate").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite dense element-load. Combines assigned traits through inventive intersections (marathon discipline enabling spectral chase, aloofness contrasting with vulnerable hugging gesture). The ending transcends simple resolution to suggest ongoing systemic change, leaving lingering questions about ethics of subsonic medical manipulation.</comment>
