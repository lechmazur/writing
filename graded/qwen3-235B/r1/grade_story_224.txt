<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character’s solitude and artistic yearning drive the narrative; his 'openly private' trait is evident through dialogue with objects. Motivation (escape → transformation) is mostly clear but lacks deeper psychological nuance. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a concise arc (entry, action, resolution) with rejuvenation as a focal point. Pacing is brisk but cohesive, though some causal links (e.g., giant’s emotional shift) feel underdeveloped. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory immersion is exceptional, blending thunderous footsteps, stardust scents, and meteorite textures. The setting’s scale and chaotic rush hour amplify the contrast between mundane and magical. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (runes “breathing,” stardust scents) create layered meaning. Subtext of self-realization through art is poignant, though some metaphors (e.g., “solitude like a cloak”) border on overwritten. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the meteorite ladle’s twist and thematic depth. Avoids cliché but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing (“storm in a teacup”) that strains naturalism. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified whole—no extraneous detail. The brevity serves thematic precision, leaving resonance through the minstrel’s internal shift rather than overt drama. </comment>
