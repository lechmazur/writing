<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s technical-artistic duality and grief anchor her actions, but emotional layers beyond her mentor’s regret lack depth. Motivation is clear but under-actualized in behavioral nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently, but the library’s ephemeral nature strains caused events’ pacing. Resolution feels earned yet slightly expedited, sacrificing visceral tension in favor of lyrical synthesis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and symbolic; frost-kissed ice library transcends genre tropes through bioluminescent fungi, moss-slick stairs, and time-tinged atmosphere that externalizes the protagonist’s psychological state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic prose and metaphor (e.g., "luminous trees—roots in present, branches in past") elevate theme beyond plot. Ending resonates, though emotional payoff’s brevity slightly limits lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging pyrotechnics with memory-as-light, avoiding genre clichés. Language is purposeful, but the "library in a waterfall" leans on familiar fantasy frameworks, requiring contextual subversion to fully transcend.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a thematically cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, with each constraint serving narrative focus, though deeper emotional complexity could elevate the already polished execution.</comment>
