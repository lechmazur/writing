<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character arc is coherent but lacks nuanced internal conflict; diplomacy background is underexploited, though the pivotal moment with the key and birds shows strong thematic alignment with her evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is purposeful but occasionally rushed (e.g., elder interaction feels compressed); the transition from trade mission to philosophical revelation could use smoother pacing within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eerie salt-mine setting is visceral and immersive, with crystal imagery and crumbling infrastructure enhancing mood; starlings’ symbolism bridges physical and thematic spaces effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric weight of flocking behavior as governance metaphor resonates deeply; lyrical closing line about “learning to fly” encapsulates the theme with haunting simplicity and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes; starling imagery and “shared breath” ledger stand out as fresh; occasional phrases (“joyfully tragic”) border on cloying but are redeemed by narrative restraint elsewhere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements interwoven with thematic purpose; constrained length feels deliberate and enhances focus; the final image of scarred hands lingers as a physicalized moral reckoning.</comment>
