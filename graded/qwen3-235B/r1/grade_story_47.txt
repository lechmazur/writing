<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Irina's transition from dutiful to rebellious lacks emotional nuance; her interactions with auditionees remain superficial despite their thematic relevance to mortality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cryptic puzzles drive the plot effectively, but the auditions' mechanical role and rapid resolution undermine character-arcs; ending resolves with thematic force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sanctuary's oppressive silence and decaying grandeur create a palpable, eerie atmosphere; sound-specific details (absence of echoes, stored voices) excel, but timeframe integration is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (gloveâ€™s transformation, "echo of defiance") and layered ending deliver emotional punch; thematic consistency between silence/rebellion sustains impact despite limited character depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subverts sanctuary tropes with rebellious undercurrents; some elements (phones, coordinates) risk feeling algorithmic. Voice notes lack organic connection to setting; prose balances lyricism and grit.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion tightly, despite pacing flaws; brevity enhances urgency. Lingering resonance lies in its meditation on defiance through sonic erasure/reclamation.</comment>
