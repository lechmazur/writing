<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (reignite warmth) is clear but underexplored. "Earnest" trait manifests through actions but lacks psychological depth. Limited emotional complexity despite poetic imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows celestial lens logic but condenses key revelations too abruptly. Pacing stumbles between epiphanies; astronomical map's activation feels rushed despite structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ruined greenhouse and desert glacial contrasts create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details (scent of rosemary, prismatic light) deepen immersive tension between decay and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (crystalline fractures mapping stellar patterns) and thematic interplay of destruction/growth resonate. Subtext about harmonizing with nature vs. conquering it emerges powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original cosmic mechanics but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("petrified serpent," "tectonic click"). Avoids genre tropes through celestial engineering concept, though some phrases feel strained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate into mythic sci-fi logic, though knight trope remains underchallenged. Poetic density rewards rereading but risks distancing casual readers despite thematic richness.</comment>
