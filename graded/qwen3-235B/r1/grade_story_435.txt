<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and actions align with it, but depth and emotional complexity lack. The borrowed identity is clever but underexplored as a vehicle for inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot unfolds cohesively, driven by clear cause-effect chains. Pacing is efficient but slightly rushed in the climax; the cyclical ending gesture is effective but risks feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, original sensory details (quartz veins, calcified laws) immerse readers. The setting’s industrial-dream fusion enhances the theme, creating a visceral, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., tyranny as baked clay) are vivid and thematically resonant. Ending sparks reflection on revolution’s cyclical nature. The subtext of systemic control is sharp and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés; worldbuilding is inventive. Sparse instances of overwrought phrasing (“seeding new laws”) but overall style is precise, evocative, and purposeful. Emotional resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, each enriching plot, theme, or setting. The economy of scope feels intentional, with the ending implying expansive societal change beyond the text.</comment>
