<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character shows some depth through memories and actions, but motivation to transcend mortality lacks nuanced development; voice remains minimally distinct despite pivotal choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight structure within constraints, but transitions between visions and memories occasionally disrupt coherence; climax/resolution feels earned despite brief runtime.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Steampunk elements are atmospheric but under-explored; sensory details effectively evoke storm setting but inconsistently anchor deeper thematic connections to the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor (e.g., scissors as tools for mending/freedom) and subtext about choice vs. fate elevates the narrative; ending resonates thematically despite sparse exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original use of parallel lives through the mirror device avoids genre clichés, but occasional overdescription (e.g., “light spilled through fissures”) borders on ornate prose without enhancing meaning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates most elements, though timeframe and “improbable confessions” feel loosely tethered; style balances poetic language with clarity, leaving lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
