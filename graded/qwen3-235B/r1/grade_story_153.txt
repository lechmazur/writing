<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's immortal pursuit of knowledge is clear but thinly rendered; motivations align with academic obsession yet lack psychological depth beyond intellectual curiosity. The headlamp’s burden symbolism is present but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from relic acquisition to ritual transformation; the digitization action drives convergence of narratives. Pacing is tight but effective within constraints. Ending’s thematic resolution (courage to hold steady) ties back to the headlamp’s dual role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eerie, tactile details (fossilized roots, mineral-dust breath, glowing glyphs) vividly ground the mole city’s paradoxically mundane yet fantastical atmosphere. Timeframe of a post-stellar era shapes but doesn’t overpower the setting’s lived-in textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (light as blade, terminal as living theorem) enrich thematic layers; ending’s quiet transformation elevates over spectacle. Emotional resonance is cerebral rather than visceral, but the “rebuilding the world” subtext lingers meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clichés; mole society’s “mundanely glorious” routines and the merged narrative’s birthing of reality-rewriting resist predictability. Prose is ornate but purposeful; emotional nuance emerges through implication rather than explicit states.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively (e.g., immortality studies link to reality-rewriting), though some feel conceptually prioritized over human relatability. The brevity serves thematic compression, leaving questions about the student’s inner life. Ending prompts reflection on stewardship vs. domination.</comment>
