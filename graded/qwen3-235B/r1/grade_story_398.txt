<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation as a guilt-ridden conjurer is clear but slightly underdeveloped due to structural constraints; Lira's exile adds depth but feels hastily contextualized. The rationalization of the obsidian's power reveals their internal conflicts effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the ashes/obsidian revelation, which drives momentum, but the shared dream mechanism feels abrupt; while the beginning/end connection is strong (ash ledger to collective weaving), pacing in the middle compresses cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (salt-crusted walls, pulsing obsidian, clacking looms) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere; the setting's liminality and the sanctuary's history as both literal and symbolic space are exquisitely rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story's subtext about sublimated collective trauma and healing through shared narrative is powerful; metaphors are consistent and resonant, though the ending's optimism risks slight sentimentalism despite its thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through fresh metaphors (guilt-as-seed, ash-as-ledger), but some phrasing ("storm-gray eyes") borders on clich√©; the non-linear chronology and layered symbolism suggest human ingenuity, though emotional nuance occasionally leans on poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into a thematically unified whole; word count amplifies the story's mythic quality rather than hindering it; the closing image of the paused tide invites reflection on collective reckoning with historical erasure.</comment>
