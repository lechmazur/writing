<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are intriguing but underdeveloped. The inventor's motivation is clear but lacks depth; Kael's history with her influences the story but their emotional dynamic feels truncated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through atmospheric clues and rain-driven discoveries. Pacing is tight but some transitions (Kael's arrival) feel abrupt. The story achieves coherence but resolution feels compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Barnacle-crusted graveyard setting is palpable through metallic humming, rain-prismatics, and salt-wreathed logbook. Sensory details create haunting, mythic atmosphere that amplifies every narrative element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("skeletal hulls like leviathan ribs") and thematic interplay between storms/human ambition. Ending achieves emotional resonance, though dialogue occasionally veers to exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional objects (pearl lens-box) and intelligent subtext. Language occasionally borders on ornate but mostly remains purposeful and imaginatively grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine into a cohesive whole. Atmosphere achieves lyrical transcendence; brevity enhances the elegiac tone. Lingers in mind through conceptual richness despite minor narrative compression.</comment>
