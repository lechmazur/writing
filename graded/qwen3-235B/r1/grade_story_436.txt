<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's sorrow and desperation are palpable, but motivations lack psychological depth; grief drives actions, yet internal logic feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a compressed arc but falters in transitions; the final-minute constraint creates urgency yet truncates emotional stakes' evolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but overly ornate; setting elements (fortress, desert) exist more as aesthetic backdrops than active forces shaping narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (salt, dream catchers) and subtext (recipe as requiem) enrich the narrative; ending resonates with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lush imagery occasionally veers into self-indulgence; some metaphors (e.g., "skeletal hands") feel borrowed, undercutting sense of originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements like the oracleâ€™s revelation and mirror ending linger, but reliance on poetic abstraction weakens narrative cohesion.</comment>
