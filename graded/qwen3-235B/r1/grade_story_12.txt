<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's aloofness inconsistently maintained; motivations around memory-mapping lack deeper contextual grounding despite a clear external arc (map deletion to kayak conversion). Shared purpose with kayaker develops abruptly, undercutting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on poetic transitions rather than structural rigor; riverfork denouement satisfying but compressed. Temporal shifts between mall/kayaking feel compressed rather than organic. Concept (memory-mapping) shapes arc but pacing uneven in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contrasts between sterile futurism and organic decay rendered through tactile details (glowing resin, chrome). Sensory immersion peaks at river scenes but secondary settings (skywalk tiers) underexplored. Atmosphere effectively mirrors theme of fractured memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracks as living memory, paddle strokes as cartography) elevate narrative into sublime abstraction. Subtext about dynamic memory versus static preservation resonates. Ending avoids cliché by privileging process over closure. Dialogue sparse but loaded with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional overreliance on lyrical abstraction ("liquid silver", "whispers between lines") risks vagueness. Kayaking subplot leans on trope of nature-as-revelation but redeems through mosaic symbolism. Emotions shown through gesture (clutching shard) rather than exposition. Technical execution mostly polished but uneven phrase density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</comment>Story coheres through persistent motif-weaving despite tight word count. Breach of expectations (futuristic mall → river epiphany) feels deliberate but under-questioned. Lingering impact lies in conceptual reframing rather than character nuance. Brief length highlights thematic concision over psychological complexity.</comment>
