<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and need to reap past regrets are distinct through dialogue and actions, but deeper exploration of his emotional conflict is missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure balances experimental concepts (decryption, regret inversion) with clear progression and a satisfying metamorphosis from regret to hope, though tight pacing occasionally flattens tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Diner setting juxtaposed with the mystical archive creates a compellingly eerie mood; sensory details (warped jukebox, glowing glyphs, crumbling whistle) enhance the theme of ephemeral regret and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (regret as a tree, whistle as its antithesis) are layered with emotional and thematic resonance; ending avoids sentimentality while inviting reflection on memory, loss, and reinvention.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original combinations (e.g., grief-as-software, whistle-as-regret-engine) avoid cliché; prose remains purposeful, though occasional phrases (e.g., "restless acceptance") risk abstraction over impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements harmonize (inventive logic, tone, concise pacing) while leaving room for subtext; concise length serves the story’s precision but slightly limits secondary character depth.</comment>
