<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (acceptance through risk) is clear and shapes actions, but interiority remains stylized over psychologically rich. The "reckless smuggler" archetype gets intriguing emotional layers through the rationally emotional attribute, though the mother's voice apparition feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Action (relic theft) drives the plot effectively, with cause-effect logic intact despite compressed structure. The ending arrives abruptly after the ledger guardian confrontation, undercutting thematic payoff about acceptance's cost. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details create an unforgettable haunted funhouse—the decaying clown facade, screeching mannequins, skeletal horses. The setting's grotesque theatricality perfectly mirrors the characters' performative bravado and thematic tension between spectacle and genuine connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong literary craft through motifs like fractured glass (clover, watch) symbolizing broken loyalties. The ending subverts triumph-as-acceptance trope by reframing it as elegy. Prose balances lyrical precision ("despair tasted sweeter when you named it") with gritty immediacy, though first-person voice occasionally feels uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fully subverts horror tropes through character-specific details (synchronized alarms as emotional currency) rather than relying on haunted park clichés. Avoids purple prose despite lush descriptions. Some phrases ("hungry ghosts") risk generality, but the ledger guardian's maternal connection adds emotionally-grounded originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of all elements—synchronized watches externalize abstract companionship concept, the clover's destruction literalizes sacrifice for belonging. The brief format feels purposeful, creating haunting ambiguity about Lira's fate and the cost of initiation. Leverages brevity for emotional resonance.</comment>
