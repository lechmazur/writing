<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but depth and emotional nuance lacking. Actions align with purpose but internal conflict remains underdeveloped. Assigned attribute feels tagged rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but strained by word limit. Key actions drive momentum yet pacing falters during critical resonance scene. Cause/effect logical but execution feels compressed. Ending abrupt yet functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly immersive through vivid sensory details and symbolic objects. Timeframe and setting intertwine effectively, though some elements verge on excessive ornamentation. Tension between tranquility and mechanical menace enhances theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emotional potency emerges through metaphor-rich imagery (e.g., "regrets dissolving into fireflies"). Literary devices elevate craft, but abrupt tonal shifts and overstated symbolism ("shattered mirrors") undercut subtlety. Ending resonates but could deepen subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids derivative tropes with inventive fusion of mechanical and organic imagery. Sensory details specific rather than generic. Emotional beats earned through context rather than exposition. No jarring formulaic patterns detected, though some phrases ("agonizing bliss") risk over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but occasionally strain under density. Short form feels intentional, sharpening emotional focus. Conceptual interplay between memory and machinery offers reflective depth. Resolution feels thematically resonant if structurally compressed.</comment>
