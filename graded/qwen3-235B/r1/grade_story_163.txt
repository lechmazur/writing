<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Main character's grief and compulsion drive actions; motivation tied to personal loss is clear but emotional depth beyond obsession could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot tightly structured around unifying fractured realities; pacing is brisk but maintains logical cause-effect. The detour as method feels somewhat undercontextualized despite narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alien ferns, chronal fungi, and collapsing dimensions create vivid, integrated atmosphere. Sensory details enhance tone; timeframe during storm enhances urgency and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Provocative themes of grief as creative force; ending reframes trauma as catalyst for rebirth. Subtext-rich metaphors ("time's arteries") and kinetic prose elevate impact without overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes entirely—bioluminescent fungi as chronal particles, inverted labs, and mycelial networks feel scientifically grounded yet poetically resonant. No artificial phrasing or emotional shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize flawlessly—the stub’s temporal shift, her fractured dual identity, and the setting’s paradoxical science create narrative inevitability within tight constraints.</comment>
