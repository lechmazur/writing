<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and duty to clan are palpable, but "natural awkwardness" feels underdeveloped beyond physical clumsiness. Motivation is clear but lacks interior depth to fully integrate his identity conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc despite constraints, but the crab ritual's abrupt success and postcard's magical activation lack sufficient cause-effect grounding. Pacing is efficient but resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully rendered through tactile details (crystallizing breath, glowing shells), creating a haunting, mythic atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the theme of bridging lost and present worlds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Storytelling achieves lyrical tension between impermanence and renewal, with the archway's fraying edges and evolving peach blossoms serving as potent symbols. Ending resonates as both resolution and transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in mythologizing hermit crabs as custodians of history, but minor purple prose ("ephemeral rancor thickened the air") and archetypal "forgive" glyph slightly detract from otherwise fresh conceptual weaving.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole greater than their parts, though the blank postcard's symbolic weight occasionally strains. Length serves the story's poetic economy, leaving lingering questions about historical erasure.</comment>
