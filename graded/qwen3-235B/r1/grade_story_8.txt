<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s dazed state and empirically rebellious motivation are present but underexplored; his actions align logically with his traits, yet lack psychological depth beyond surface-level contradictions. The dialogue reveals thematic intent but feels more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses cohesively via the chalk equations triggering the garden’s transformation, with clear cause-effect and a compact arc. Pacing slightly rushed in the climax, but integrates the story’s elements efficiently within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strikingly original sensory details (singing ivy, gamma-ray melodies) immerse readers; atmosphere mirrors the theme of logic vs. chaos. Timeframe and setting are symbiotic, enhancing the surreal, urgent tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evoke wonder through vivid imagery and subtext about heritage vs. innovation. Dialogue sparse but purposeful; theme of bridging order and anarchy resonates. Ending satisfies as both closure and open-ended provocation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive metaphors (fchalk supernovas, Fibonacci vines) and emotional nuance shown through action. No overwrought prose; balances precision and poeticism. Originality slightly tempered by archetypal “rebel genius” trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story coexists fluidly with its elements, prioritizing thematic unity over formula. Length serves the narrative’s experimental tone. Leaves a lingering impression of intellectual defiance and cosmic playfulness.</comment>
