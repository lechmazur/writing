<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marisol’s history as a con artist justifies her mimicry skills crucial to the plot, but her emotional transformation feels slightly underdeveloped despite sharp moments of self-awareness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot moves cleanly from inciting incident (logger threat) to resolution (symphony repelling bulldozers), though the introduction of the foreman’s daughter feels abrupt, weakening cause-effect logic slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lush, specific sensory details (petrichor, toucan startled by laughter, "decaying leaves and hope") create an immersive, mythic rainforest atmosphere that directly supports the fungal flame’s symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fungus as "tomorrow’s flame," yodeling as "vines stitching wounds") are striking, though the ending’s thematic clarity—guardianship as collective echoes—edges toward didacticism despite poetic execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the con artist’s redemption through sound, not theft, but the phrase "sharp enough to startle a toucan" leans toward forced whimsy; overall voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically (sheet music bridges past/future; rainforest logic justifies fungal flame) though the doctor’s-office framing device feels loosely attached rather than deeply thematic.</comment>
