<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's actions reflect complex history with veil and idol, but motivation to topple tyranny lacks explicit connection to emotional state. Internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from cultivation of orchard to climactic idol destruction, but the transition between fruit/seed symbolism and decisive action feels slightly schematic within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details like frost-rimed glass and groaning ice floes create haunting atmosphere. The crystalline imagery and frozen decay seamlessly support thematic tensions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like the veil/shadow interplay and "forbidden calculus" enrich narrative. Ending's contemplative awe resonates, though emotional impact is muted by the emotionless world premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of mythic and scientific motifs avoids clichés, but some phrasing ("prismatic edges," "wounded ghost") risks poetic excess. Emotional subtext feels deliberately restrained rather than artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements weave cohesively despite constraints—orchard's algorithms, snowflake geometries, and emotional death all serve theme. Short-form brevity feels purposeful but limits character depth.</comment>
