<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mei-Ling’s motivation to resist AI platitudes is clear but lacks psychological nuance; her decisive action is plot-convenient without sufficient emotional grounding in her traditionalist ideology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crack’s revelation as a "door" drives concise cause-and-effect, though the resolution feels underexplored; the word limit necessitates compressed emotional stakes despite structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prismatic imagery and the kaleidoscope studio’s sensory details (shattered light, origami shadows) create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere that directly shapes the protagonist’s mystical journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closing prophecy effectively encapsulates the theme; metaphors (crack as memory, inkstone as legacy) enrich subtext, though the oracle’s wind-chime voice veers toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through specific symbolism (e.g., "squid ink and starlight") and a non-linear resolution; the tension between tradition and AI feels fresh despite the whimsical tone’s occasional proximity to sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Holistic integration of elements (e.g., chipped tile as thematic linchpin) elevates cohesion; the cryptic ending lingers but risks vagueness in its thematic abstraction.</comment>
