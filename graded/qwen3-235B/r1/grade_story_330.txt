<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation to reclaim honor through the vow is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his internal conflict beyond exposition; actions align with resolve but emotional layers remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc, but pacing feels rushed—especially the transition to the sunken realm—and the zero-gravity inversion lacks narrative anchoring to sustain its surreal impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive, otherworldly atmosphere; the zero-gravity hall and shipwreck cathedral evoke vivid mood, though the tone’s connection to character psychology is uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "dancers trailing starlight") and thematic hints of silenced vows are undercut by abrupt shifts and a conclusion that resolves too cleanly for the depth promised.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending sci-fi and mythic elements, but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; the knight’s journey avoids formulaic tropes but could refine emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story’s brevity hinders full cohesion; ambitious elements like the inverted hall and anemone throne intrigue but leave lingering questions about thematic integration over spectacle.</comment>
