<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's unsteady nature and obsession with prophecy are clear, but their internal logic and backstory remain underdeveloped despite key moments like the surgeon's scar revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot arc has visceral progression from confusion to self-sacrificial resolution, but the rapid shift to self-dissection feels contrived despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (fractured viewport static, "metallic snow") create haunting atmosphere; colliding worlds and derelict setting are seamlessly integrated with thematic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of paradoxical imagery ("cheerless ecstasy," "mournful automaton") and layered metaphors; ending offers emotional resonance if slightly overdetermined thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but has occasional overwrought phrasing ("throbbed with static of colliding worlds") and slightly mechanical emotional shifts that undercut human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements combine ingeniously—shredded physical/spiritual texts, sentient antagonism—but the ending’s metaphysical resolution feels slightly disconnected from earlier gritty corporeality.</comment>
