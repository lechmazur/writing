<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Contradictory traits (docile vs. bruiser) underdeveloped; calmness shown but physicality remains abstract. Motivation to "mold a myth" feels imposed rather than organically connected to character traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot driven by setpiece encounters rather than organic progression. Batoning action/resolution feels symbolic but lacks tangible stakes. Pacing rushed yet atmospheric elements sustain coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dense sensory details create vivid tableaux but fail to unify solstice festival rhythms with greenhouse decay. Tonally inconsistent atmosphere undermines "brash tenderness" â€“ tends toward brutalism over emotional contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (conducting death, myth as cultivation) elevate beyond genre tropes. Ending's thematic resonance ("retold, not resurrected") compelling, though myth-making concept remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Original premise but undercut by uneven execution. Greenhouse labyrinth strains credulity; over-reliance on "whispered" motifs. Baton's magic system logic feels borrowed rather than discovered. Tension between mythmaking and resurrection underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements service style over substance. Word limit exposes half-formed connections (language barriers, grandmother's history). Lingering question about myth's ethics vs. narrative payoff remains promising.</comment>
