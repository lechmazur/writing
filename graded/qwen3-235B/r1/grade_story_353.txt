<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (tyrant's oppression, maternal legacy) but psychological depth suffers from brevity; "cynically gentle" manifests in actions but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot resolves tightly within constraints through seed planting's consequences, but the boy-with-starlight deus ex machina disrupts causality despite thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory synthesis of bakery smells with magical elements creates immersive atmosphere; celestial mechanics grounded in tactile details like "flour tattoos."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as dough, revolution as recipe) elevate narrative; emotional resonance emerges through subtext, though ending's abruptness weakens thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through original combinations (time machines/gardens) and layered symbolism; some phrases ("crystalline and ravenous vines") border on overwrought lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlocked into resonant whole despite word constraints; ending balances closure and lingering thematic resonance through transformed setting details (dandelion wine stalls replacing sirens).</comment>
