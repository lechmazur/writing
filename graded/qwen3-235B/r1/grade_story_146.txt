<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but reactions to visions lack depth; emotional nuances around her gift and the flute's power could be more fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly cohesive, but the rapid escalation from discovery to mob confrontation feels underdeveloped; pacing is tight yet occasionally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (e.g., "scent of damp soil," "mosaic of symbols") create atmosphere but feel sparse in key moments; the archive’s setting is vivid but lacks layered worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The flute’s symbolism works well, but the story’s themes of sacred development and balance are introduced rather than deeply interrogated; ending resonates but feels slightly unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some tropes (e.g., cursed artifact, prophetic visions) are tempered by specificity, but phrases like "whispers of lost wisdom" verge on cliché; emotional beats rely partially on stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated, but the story leans heavily on their inclusion rather than organic cohesion; the ending hints at broader implications without fully delivering them.</comment>
