<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict with trauma is clear, but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient emotional groundwork. Voice distinct but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Begins and ends with cyclical motifs, but pacing in middle sections falters—resolution feels sudden despite buildup. Fractals-to-rainstreet transition lacks narrative spine.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel’s iridescent decay and rain-as-metaphor are viscerally rendered. Some elements (e.g., funeral hymn) feel tonally dissonant without deeper context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbology (lure/nest/tunnel) delivers quiet devastation. Ending’s transcendence risks sentimentality but is grounded by tactile details (ash, feathers, taste of rain).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in trauma-as-palimpsest concept, but "quantum tunnel" veers toward speculative cliché. Avoids over-explanation, trusting reader to decode subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Packs density into brevity without sacrificing emotional heft. Conceptual overload near resolution, but thematic unity and linguistic precision make it memorable.</comment>
