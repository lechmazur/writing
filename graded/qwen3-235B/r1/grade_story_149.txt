<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks psychological depth; motivations shift abruptly from apathy to messianic fervor without organic emotional progression. Dialogue fails to establish distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure undermines coherence; key transitions (e.g., protagonist's power awakening, mass unification) lack narrative scaffolding. Plot progression feels arbitrary within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vivid but superficial sensory details (e.g., "detergent and burnt copper") create atmosphere without substance. Setting disconnection weakens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Provocative imagery ("stitching sanity") and theme of destructive enlightenment show promise, but subtext remains underdeveloped beneath lurid surfaces.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors compete with trite phrasing ("keystone," "symphony of gasps"). Tropes like the "chosen one" receive no meaningful subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but structurally incoherent. Elemental integration feels mechanical; thematic resonance remains latent beneath stylistic excess.</comment>
