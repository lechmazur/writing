<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Bartender’s trauma and scientific obsession are clear, but character’s internal conflict lacks nuanced complexity beyond thematic desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but some plot mechanics (e.g., algorithm linking doodles instantly) feel rushed; ending resolution implies forward momentum but lacks closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Elements work cohesively to explore existential themes; brevity amplifies mystery but limits deeper exploration of character and world.</comment>
