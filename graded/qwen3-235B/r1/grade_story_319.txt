<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s internal conflict is well-established through physical frailty and symbolic objects, but deeper emotional exploration is lacking; motivation for escape is clear but could be more nuanced beyond inherited fate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to escape, with cause-effect clarity. Pacing is slightly uneven in middle, but tight structure effectively conveys transformation within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details (salt, sour phial smells, oak carvings), creating oppressive isolation and haunting beauty that mirrors the guard’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors, subtext of self-determination, and layered symbolism (phial, eroding crown) deepen thematic resonance. Ending’s ambiguous hope invites reflection on identity beyond imposed roles.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes with specific details (e.g., smuggler’s tunnel, rusted chain) and avoids overly ornate prose. Subtlety in character choice (“wavering” carved in bark) suggests human nuance over formulaic structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>All elements cohere around central theme of self-defined freedom. Style balances lyrical description with lean narrative momentum appropriate to constrained length, leaving lasting emotional resonance.</comment>
