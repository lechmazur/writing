<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's past as game show host influences dialogue ("Audience vote") but lacks deeper personality integration; emotional arc underexplored despite crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from stranded desperation to escape, but pacing compresses developments (sabotage, vault discovery); cause/effect connections sometimes strained by brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (fermented coconut milk, upward trickling water) create vivid immersion; insect symphony shapes mood but feels underutilized as symbolic element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("hourglass sand," "bitter honey") layer subtext; ending's thematic resonance (survival as prize) and character transformation elevate craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (submerged library as archives) and delivers unexpected twists (sabotage as ongoing threat); some phrasing (oceanic "symphony") risks over-polish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elaborate setting-concept integration succeeds despite constraints; cohesive fusion of typewriter decay, crystal ball visions, and guardian mythos creates lingering metaphoric impact.</comment>
