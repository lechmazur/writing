<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Actions drive plot but pacing uneven—void's arrival feels rushed; lullaby translation method intriguing but under-explained; cohesive arc weakened by abrupt tonal shifts in final pages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Memory crystal library's fragmented recollections and warped lullabies create immersive atmosphere; wooden spoon's tactile connection to memories enhances mood; "architecture of the mind" timeframe metaphorically realized but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (lullabies as souls, wooden spoon as nurturing symbol) resonate emotionally; theme of humanity arising from fragility is poignant; ending shows disciplined prose but lacks deeper emotional crescendo.</comment>
