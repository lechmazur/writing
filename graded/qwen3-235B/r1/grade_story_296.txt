<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Protagonist’s motivation to “map spiritual paths” lacks clear connection to reactor-fixing; symbolic use of chopsticks reveals resilience, but emotional depth remains abstract despite poetic voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cookbook-as-instruction manual drives plot effectively; pacing is tight but some leaps (e.g., spiritual paths → reactor repair) strain logic within word limit. Resolution feels earned, if rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Brine-streaked portholes, curry/ramen details, and pressure-hull tension evoke submarine reality; atmosphere enhances chaos-beauty theme, though setting-character integration could deepen.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., “constellation of failures”), symbolic chopsticks, and layered ending (“balance isn’t perfection”) evoke lasting resonance; dialogue sparse but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through inventive fusion (cookbook + sabotage) and poetic restraint; occasional abstractions (“familiar enigma”) risk vagueness but align with tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements cohere into a tightly-woven whole; spiritual mapping feels forced, but chopsticks, cookbook, and submarine setting synergize inventively. Lingering theme of fragile balance lingers.</comment>
