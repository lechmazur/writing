<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Priorities align with zealotry but secondary characters lack depth; motivation tied to legacy is clear yet personal conflicts remain underexplored. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite introspective narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot driven by visualization mechanic with satisfying arc through sacrifice realization; pacing is tight but transitions between historical context and lab action feel rushed. Cause-effect connections (e.g., insurgency’s impact) skim surface.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting’s rustic refinement via copper pipes and antique tech successfully juxtaposes chaos with elegance; atmosphere enhanced by sensory details (tea stains, hissing equations). Timeframe’s political instability requires more atmospheric integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (currency as fossilized cries) and subtext about legacy vs. erasure resonate. Ending achieves thematic closure through unmarked coin paradox. Subtly critiques historical preservation through visceral dissolution imagery. Limited emotional immediacy with secondary figures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing (“attractor arrays humming with unstable harmonics”) while sustaining thematic consistency. Evokes emotional nuance through symbolic objects rather than exposition. No cliché reliance; unique fusion of economics, physics, and spirituality in concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interwoven thematically (money as legacy载体, lab as method) with economy of language. Concise format amplifies existential stakes. Lingering resonance from paradoxical sacrifice concept and tactile ending details.</comment>
