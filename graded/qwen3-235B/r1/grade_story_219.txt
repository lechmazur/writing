<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's fading brilliance is hinted but lacks emotional depth; motivation to map consciousness is abstract but drives some plot actions despite limited psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from relic-unfolding to dissolution with visual momentum; cause-effect is consistent but pacing feels compressed, with the climax arriving abruptly without earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (brittle hush, corn husk texture) and surreal imagery (shifting sands, bleeding synapses); enhances theme but occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (roots of consciousness, radial time) are striking; ending transcends plot to evoke unity with the "network"; self-aware language ("child's sketch") elevates thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, non-trope metaphors avoid formula; emotional nuance is implied through symbolic acts (weaving husk into swan) rather than direct statement; prose occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction but retains individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements (origami, corn husk, broken clock) are interwoven cohesively; concepts are rich but narrative brevity leaves some implications underexplored, favoring poetic momentum over structural innovation.</comment>
