<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's ambition is explicit but lacks psychological nuance; motivations through "not enough" are clear yet underexplored beyond surface-level angst; reactions to clothespin and bunker reveal determination but not complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Storm-driven divergence works logically; regeneration catalyzes action but resolution feels rushed as wings appear deus ex machina; coherence exists within constraints but falls short of satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm's fury contrasts with sterile bunker's "hushed turbulence"; sensory details (clothespin's bite, glowing veins) visceral and immersive; setting-as-character enhances thematic tension between natural and artificial life.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "drumming chant" resonate; theme of grace vs. struggle has subtext; ending's thematic flourish feels overwritten yet potent; tension between simplicity and miracles explored through vivid "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Sterile tomb," "chlorophyll-knitting air" subvert sci-fi tropes; occasional over-flourish ("raw and bright laughter"); emotional beats shown through plant regeneration rather than stated; avoids clich√© but edges toward poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements blend tighter than expected; brevity serves mythic tone; conclusion's "hushed turbulence" lingers; risks pretension but redeems itself through visceral imagery and thematic unity.</comment>
