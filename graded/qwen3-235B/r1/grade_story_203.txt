<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's stage fright is present but underexplored; motivations tied to legacy of lies are implied but lack depth. Internal conflict is hinted at but not fully mined for psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but relies on abrupt supernatural shifts; cause/effect between key-turning and entity's arrival lacks explanation. Resolution feels symbolic but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris and toy assembly juxtapose mechanical vs. organic; sensory details vivid but worldbuilding feels surface-level—AI lullabies and gravity mechanics unexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (flowers as lies, exorcism as sculpture) are resonant; ending elevates theme. Emotional impact from imagery and subtext exceeds explicit explanations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by blending exorcism with sci-fi; some phrases ("neutron stars," "defiant hush") feel crafted rather than organic. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements integrated cohesively with thematic spine; brevity enhances mystique. Lingering question about inherited trauma lingers, though deeper social/psychological layers are missing.</comment>
