<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot has strong arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but the parallel dimension's introduction feels abrupt. Pacing manages tension within constraints but lacks subtle buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers in the ethereal setting. The floating island's fragility mirrors the theme. Atmosphere enhances both character resolve and cosmic stakes.</comment>
