<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (uncover engineered downfall) is clear and drives actions, but internal conflict lacks depth. The noble's reassembly of stubs reveals determination but limited emotional complexity; Mara's dialogue adds contrast but remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses coherently through ticket stubs to discovery of betrayal, with tight cause-effect between stubs and drone's actions. Pacing feels slightly rushed in combustion chamber climax but maintains arc within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Combustion lab's hollow recklessness is vividly rendered with acrid scents and unstable machinery. Timeframe between texts heightens tension. Sensory details (emerald drone feathers, lab's frost-gasp) create immersive, decaying atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric use of hummingbird as truth-seeker and stubs as cipher create layered meaning. Ending's ambiguity (sent ticket stub) evokes lingering unease. Some declarative sentences ("They'd been engineered to burn") reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with original elements (combustion lab, betrayal chemically visible). Minimalistic Mara interactions prevent over-explanation. Prose occasionally tilts toward ornate descriptions ("sirens silenced by laughter") but maintains purposeful style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements serve thematic cohesion: drone, stubs, and lab interlock to explore truth-seeking through fragmentation. Brief text exchanges imply deeper relationships without over-explaining. Ending lingers as unresolved reckoning.</comment>
