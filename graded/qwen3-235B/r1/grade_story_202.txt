<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character shows emotional depth through the poisonous revelation and familial guilt, but motivations around skateboarding-as-gravity-testing remain underexplored. The "careful poisoner" trait influences one key plot point but isn't fully woven into character decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt progression follows logical cause-and-effect, but the skateboarding framing device feels artificially appended rather than organically connected to the puzzle-solving. The ending resolves emotional arcs neatly but the rapid resolution of the central mystery strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail elevates the decaying museum atmosphere—cracked skylights, echoey marble, bioluminescent jars create immersive environment. The dusty starlight motif harmonizes with the poignancy of deteriorating objects and posthumous revelations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor of mending breaks resonates thematically. The final skateboard flight powerfully "shows" emotional transformation rather than stating it. Some overly poetic descriptions risk melodrama, but most imagery and symbolism (locket as legacy, skatepark as battleground) land effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts "museum mystery" tropes by blending skate-punk energy with historical artifacts. Avoids clichéd AI flourishes through precise, purposeful descriptions (e.g., taxonomy of decay). The mother's engineered death provides genuine emotional surprise rather than algorithmic twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole—museum decay mirrors emotional repression, poison expertise fuels both plot and character history. The skateboarding time frame could better justify itself narratively, but the compact length showcases economy of storytelling.</comment>
