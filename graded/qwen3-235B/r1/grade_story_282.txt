<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's brashness is visible through physical actions, but internal motivations and conflicts lack depth. The tie between his role as a blacksmith and symbolic actions (e.g., forging reciprocity) could be more explicitly developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from discovery to climax, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions (e.g., sudden chamber activation) feeling under-explained. The ending ties back to the beginning effectively but glosses over how Garrick deduces the solution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "glittering storms of dust" and spectral players create vivid immersion. The nautilus-shell motif and fossilized shell’s connection to the medal deepen the setting’s logic. Tonal contrast between the grungy store and mystical chamber enhances tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "dust became dice") and the theme of reciprocity as preservation are striking. The ending evokes lingering resonance through cyclical imagery (clerk’s laugh echoing). Subtext about cultural memory is implied but could be more fully unpacked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes with unique elements (e.g., blacksmith saving games), but some phrases ("dust swirled faster," "chamber roared") lean on generic momentum. Emotional beats occasionally default to explicit statements rather than subtext or sensory nuance.</comment>
