<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptual drive overshadows human nuance; motivations implied through symbols (mechanical arm, sock) but character psychology underdeveloped. Internal conflict lacks visceral grounding despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragmented yet purposeful structure; key events (sock ignition, machinery reveal) drive momentum, but abrupt shifts in logic (earth-bound gears) disrupt cohesion. Resolution satisfies intellectually but not emotionally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (hissing gears, fraying sock, phantom colors) enhance storm-wracked lighthouse setting, but deeper integration of "mechanical vs. organic" into atmosphere falters. Tone inconsistent in quieter moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphoric layering (sock as applause/memory/tapestry), subtextual exploration of creation/destruction duality, and haunting imagery elevate impact. Ending's thematic payoff rewards attentive reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts tropes (lighthouse as machine, dream-weaving as self-annihilation) with inventive metaphysical logic. Avoids purple prose despite ornate descriptions. Emotional resonance occasionally undercut by abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere through metaphor but strain under literal scrutiny (e.g., "earth-bound machinery"). Concise format serves poetic ambitions but sacrifices emotional intimacy. Lingering resonance stems from conceptual boldness.</comment>
