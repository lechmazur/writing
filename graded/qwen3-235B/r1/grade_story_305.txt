<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation (dethroning complacency) and consistent actions (methodical quest, intellectual focus), but character depth remains superficial beyond traits; "voice" emerges faintly through decisive dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight connection between cake-timed plotting and climax; pacing efficient but rushed transitions (e.g., ghost's abrupt intent) slightly undermine coherence; resolution satisfies cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lush, cohesive atmosphere with sensory-rich details (humidity, lantern-lit gloom); setting meaningfully mirrors themes (ruined opera house as buried history), though storm clichés undercut originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (echoes as living history), haunting imagery; ending delivers thematic resonance; subtext about knowledge’s cost is potent, though dialogue with cartographer borders on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes (mischievous cartographer as ghost subverts expectations), but some ornate phrasing ("scorned lover’s tears") leans formulaic; emotional nuance lacks beneath surface-thoughtful concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements tightly interwoven (baking time enables quest, tablet drives thesis); brevity feels purposeful, lingering questions about knowledge’s cost; only minor awkwardness in cartographer’s riddle execution.</comment>
