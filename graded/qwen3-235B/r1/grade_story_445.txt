<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is archetypal, lacking depth beyond symbolic function; motivation is clear but feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive arc despite word limit, though the hiking trail setup and secret room feel contrived; pacing mostly controlled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve theme, but some (secret agent room) feel forced; short form enhances brevity but sacrifices nuance.</comment>
