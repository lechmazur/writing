<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's phobias and profession are tightly interwoven, but her broader psychological depth remains thin beyond fear-as-motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cyclical structure is ambitious and cohesive, but the abrupt temporal jumps (e.g., "Years later") strain narrative continuity within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually striking and cohesive atmosphere; the decaying pyramid library and fossilized net create an immersive, tactile void where the supernatural feels physically real.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (net as trauma, unraveling as healing) resonate emotionally; the ending’s recursive symbolism lingers, though some themes border on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strongly avoids cliché through specific, grotesque imagery (e.g., "codfish skin book"), though occasional phrases ("dancing on edges") flirt with purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically for a thematic whole, but the story leans heavily on symbolic density to compensate for thin character backstory.</comment>
