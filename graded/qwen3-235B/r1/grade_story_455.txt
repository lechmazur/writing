<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (confronting ghosts) is clear but backstory feels crowded with too many unresolved elements (father, double agent, lover). His actions (using coins as talismans) reveal determination but psychological depth suffers from brevity. Voice is distinct yet inconsistent—shifts from poetic ('curating fragments of dreams') to clichéd ('liberated teeth').</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from stagnation to transformation, using coin-based mechanics effectively. Pacing within word limit is strong, but the Cold War spy route backstory disrupts internal logic. Cause-effect clear for physical actions, but emotional stakes resolve too conveniently at grove confrontation. Ending ties back to opening well effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Moody, elegiac atmosphere created through vivid sensory details (gun oil, bergamot, spectral faces). Setting's blend of ancient oak/wishing well with Cold War history feels conceptually jarring. Shadows' supernatural behavior establishes mystery but 'escape route' explanation undercuts eerie tone with genre contrivance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (coins as 'liberated teeth', scars becoming compass) elevate narrative. Ending evokes thematic resonance through cyclical structure—pockets króna as new beginning. Emotional impact from subtext (generational trauma) works better than explicit ghost dialogue. Subtlety in early coin descriptions pays off in talisman usage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés with inventive details (coin-specific symbolism, shadow arrowhead). Some purple prose ('dawn's blush met twilight's sigh') and abrupt motif shifts (sniper stillness, camera lenses). Ghosts as 'spectral faces' feel familiar but their manifestation through damp bricks adds uniqueness. Emotional progression shows through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elemental integration—theory-driven plot mechanics serve character arc. Foreign coins function as both literal keys and emotional symbols. Brevity amplifies poetic density without feeling constrained. Lingering questions about Cold War lore slightly undermine resolution but reinforce theme of unresolved history.</comment>
