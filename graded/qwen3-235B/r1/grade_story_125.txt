<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; emotional resonance relies on concept rather than depth. Sarcastic voice distinct but insufficiently evolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot compression works: hologram exposition efficiently connects past/future. Sudden climax slightly underprepared, but tight pacing serves the scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Landscape-as-technology fusion visceral through soil charts/terminals. Sensory details (grime, drones, blinking glass) layer eerie pragmatism without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of overlooked agency resonate beyond surface plot. The "routine-as-magic" subtext elevates genre tropes, though emotional beats stay implied rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids magic-system clichés by redefining "power" through agricultural repetition. The doll's dismemberment-as-delivery and hologram's punchy dialogue subvert expectations with dry wit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Cohesive despite high-concept density. The abandoned station operates as literal/metaphorical crossroads where all elements – magic, ancestry, capitalism – intersect organically.</comment>
