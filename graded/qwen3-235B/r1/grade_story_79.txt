<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's grief and resolve are vivid but lack layered internal conflict; Clara's ghost exists more as a plot device than a fully realized secondary character. Dialogue feels archetypally poetic rather than personally distinctive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambitious compression of scope works against itself - astronomical calculations juxtaposed with metaphysical stakes create narrative whiplash; pivotal chain-hurling moment lacks sufficient mechanical or emotional buildup within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical fusion of quantum physics and Romantic poetry creates a singular liminal space; sensory details like "equations dissolving into sonnets" and "prismatic glass painting equations" achieve sublime synthesis of the story's core thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors transcend decoration to become structural ("calculus like lace"); the ending's paradoxical "new equation... etched in starlight" crystallizes theme with haunting economy. Emotional impact derived from tonal precision rather than declarative statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through conceptual juxtapositions, but occasionally falters into astronomical/philosophical abstraction; some phrases ("wilted crops and hollowed voices") border on poetic formula. Sublime moments outweigh occasional overwritten passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Each element interlocks with philosophical rigor; the library as a cathedral of contested reality anchors conceptually ambitious elements. Final image of "chain's echo" haunting protagonist suggests psychological complexity beyond immediate narrative closure.</comment>
