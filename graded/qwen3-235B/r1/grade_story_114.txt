<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's apathy-as-shield motif is effective, but motivation's philosophical complexity isn't fully unpacked; the grandmother's influence feels underdeveloped despite strong voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear temporal logic (building reefs "in reverse") creates satisfying paradoxical arc; the unfolding action drives coherence despite tight constraints, though pacing feels slightly uneven in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Phantom waves and kelp-stardust incense create immersive synesthetic atmosphere; the dying-god backdrop and spectral curator enhance thematic resonance between water's memory and artistic regeneration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose creates profound eco-theological subtext; the tension between curator's traditionalism and summoner's "regurgitation" method offers rich interpretive layers about creation/destruction cycles.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original alchemy of surreal elements (kelp-stardust incense, coral-bone hybrids) avoids clich√©; occasional over-reliance on "dying god" trope mitigates but doesn't undermine inventiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically into mythopoetic ecology; the brevity enhances thematic focus on cyclical time better than expansion would, leaving haunting questions about rebirth's ethics.</comment>
