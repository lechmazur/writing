<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear traits and motivation, but lacks emotional depth and nuanced reactions beyond surface-level "jumper" behavior. Motives align with actions but aren't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with clear three-act structure compressed into limited words. Pacing effectively balances action/confrontation/resolution, though ending feels slightly rushed in thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Immersive world-building with pixelated decay and video-game mechanics. Sensory details (glitching portal, static hum) create vivid atmosphere that supports rebellion theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of server-as-parasite critiques ideological manipulation. Ending leaves lingering thematic questions about perpetual rebellion. Shows through symbolism rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by combining necromancy with digital dystopia. Emotional restraint enhances authenticity. Some descriptors (e.g., "jumpy") oversimplify but overall maintains unique voice through precise code-related imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of assigned elements (mural decryption, glowing fishhook) into cohesive narrative. Leaves provocative questions about cyclical revolution without feeling forced.</comment>
