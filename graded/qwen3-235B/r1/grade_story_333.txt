<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's "sincere rebel" trait is implied through actions but lacks explicit rebellious context beyond preservation; motivation tied to grandfather's note is clear but emotional depth unevenly developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plotted with tight cause-effect around the "constantly changing" passage; pacing balances revelation and resolution efficiently, though ghost introduction slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: sensory details (dust as "fractured time," "trembling plaster") and setting symbiosis with theme are visceral; "braided bitterness" tone permeates effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evokes introspection via metaphor-rich prose ("mortar memory into stone") and layered theme of collective preservation; dialogue occasionally stilted but ending resonates emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through inventive interplay of secrets and architecture; metaphors fresh, emotional nuance shown rather than told, and linguistic purposefulness avoid AI-era pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesive despite constraints; brevity enhances urgency, though broader character arcs are sacrificed; lingering resonance stems from universal tension between progress and preservation.</comment>
