<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Scarecrow's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with duty but internal conflict hinted rather than explored. Distinct voice but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect through VR glitch to rift severance. Pacing constrained by word limit; abrupt shifts between realities slightly disrupt flow despite cohesive arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., static-humming fan, pixelated wraiths) create strong atmosphere, but the VR/fossilized giant duality feels tonally inconsistent. Setting-plot integration uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses striking metaphors (fan as "key," giant's heartbeat as "collapsing stars") and explores theme of irreversible duty. Emotional resonance weakened by abrupt ending and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh concepts (fossilized giant mapping parallel worlds). Some ornate phrasing risks purple prose, but AI-like formulaic elements avoided. VR integration feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematically unified whole, but word limit restricts deeper exploration. Style enhances mood; closing image lingers. Not all assigned elements feel indispensable.</comment>
