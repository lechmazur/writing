<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's irate motivation and grief are consistently portrayed through symbolic objects and actions, but internal conflict depth could be more viscerally explored; chopstick and tea rituals effectively externalize emotion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure within constraints; cause-effect between past trauma and present quest is clear, but the abrupt canyon revelation may feel under-motivated without more atmospheric foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally rendered setting—fractured panels, ionized fog, rusted machinery—creates a haunting, lived-in decay that mirrors emotional desolation, though timeframe integration could be more sensory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (revolting heart, singing chopstick) and circular symbolism (spiral tea leaves, unclenching fist) create resonant subtext; ending avoids sentimentality for poignant fatalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original inversion of gravity/water tropes and humanistic grief portrayal avoid genre clichés; occasional ornate phrasing ("abstractly physical") risks veering toward lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements cohere into thematic unity without feeling forced; brevity enhances urgency; leaves lingering questions about memorialization's cost versus closure.</comment>
