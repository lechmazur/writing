<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Warlock’s "thin-lipped" trait lacks symbolic payoff; motivations (knowledge-gorging) are clear but emotionally flat; reactions to artifact reveal ambition over depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight structure driven by "optimizing" artifact; cause-effect between ritual and collapse is logical; pacing precise for word count; cyclical end-around-new-year motif strengthens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glyph-carved mine-as-ribcage fused with Nordic decay creates visceral, unforgettable atmosphere; sensory details (pine tar, brine) deepen thematic hunger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (knowledge’s "toothed fruit") and subtext on historical amnesia resonate; ending’s tragic irony (equations as self-destruction) lingers; tension between control and chaos crystallized in imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh syncretism of Viking mysticism/quantitative obsession avoids genre tropes; stumbles slightly with "murmurs warned" rather than earned foreshadowing; language precise but occasionally mannered ("rot-sweet").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (fragility of knowledge, devouring past) but vary slightly in plot necessity; brevity amplifies existential fable tone; ending invites philosophical meditation.</comment>
