<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with loss-driven desperation but emotional depth lacks nuance beyond stoic determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a tight progression but relies on compressed exposition; resolution feels slightly abrupt within constraints, though cause-effect logic holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with "creaking observatory" and "brine/smoke" imagery but inconsistent sensory immersion; tone blends grit and cosmic wonder unevenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong literary devices with resonant symbols (sea glass, Maw's frequency) and thematic hints about loss, but emotional weight remains implicit rather than viscerally shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with inventive combinations (radiance-siphoning, "doubt’s eventide") but some phrases ("weave hunger into a bridge") verge on overwrought abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly into a resonant whole; compression amplifies tension rather than feeling restrictive; leaves lingering questions about cosmic redemption through trauma.</comment>
