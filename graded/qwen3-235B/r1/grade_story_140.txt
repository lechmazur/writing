<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli’s trauma and guilt are visceral, but his emotional journey lacks layered complexity. His actions align with being a "tortured protector," though internal conflict could deepen through subtle hesitations rather than explicit exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot pivots cleanly on the doll’s symbolism and Eli’s choice to destroy it. Pacing is tight despite complex backstory; cause/effect (dawn setting→confrontation→purification) is logical. A slightly abrupt resolution, but fitting for the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion (burnt sugar, rust, velvet curtains bleeding into void) merges decay and cosmic horror. The abandoned circus dressing room is a character itself, mirroring Eli’s fractured psyche. Unimpeachable atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("light you swallowed," "storm/conduit") resonate thematically. The ending’s duality—blistered hands clutching the smile—avoids neatness by questioning what trauma leaves behind. Subtext about creation/destruction cycles is potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy tropes; the doll’s horror is original (syrup-thick voice, void-consuming blaze). No purple prose, but the planetarium’s "star-flecked" woman leans slightly on mystic shorthand. Emotional resonance is earned through physicality (blistered palms, pocketed shard).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere like a nightmare with precise logic. The short form feels purposeful—the brevity mirrors Eli’s repressed memories exploding into catharsis. Lingering subtext: healing as self-annihilation and rebirth.</comment>
