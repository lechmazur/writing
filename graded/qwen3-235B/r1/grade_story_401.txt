<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s motivation tied to inherited guilt is clear, but emotional complexity underdeveloped; reactions to the blanket and ring lack visceral immediacy despite thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through decoding the blanket, with revelations about Eleanor driving momentum; pacing remains taut, though the avalanche backstory feels slightly rushed within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of drowned decay vividly realized through coral-coated ship details and tactile sensory textures (e.g., "rotting harpsichord"), amplifying haunting legacy of silencing women’s truths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance in exploring inherited guilt and reconciliation as active unraveling; metaphors (knitting as confession, ring as decoder) deepen themes without overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases lean into poetic density ("cathedral of coral and shadow") but avoid florid excess; decoding blanket gimmick feels slightly contrived but serves thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively into layered narrative; concise form elevates urgency; closing image of burning the blanket lingers as ritual of cyclical accountability.</comment>
