<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ellis' motivation to seize the horizon through time measurement is clear but underexplored; his 'loyalty/disloyalty' lacks psychological nuance; dialogue with Maris hints at deeper backstory but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Time-bending action maintains internal logic; transitions between café and grocery store are fluid despite surrealism; ending resolves character arc but slightly underdevelops temporal consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Midnight café's sensory details ('comet tail thread,' 'typewriter ribbon bitterness') create vivid, immersive atmosphere; time-warped setting masterfully enhances thematic tension between stasis and motion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (spoon as timekeeper, horizon as origami) offer layered meaning; emotional resonance through subtext rather than exposition; ending's typewriter clack cleverly echoes cyclical longing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Occasional overly decorative phrases ('loyally disloyal') risk pretension; 'burnt ribbons' and 'unsent apologies' combination feels intentionally fresh; emotional progression from despair to transcendence avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize through time obsession motif; brevity strengthens thematic focus; lollipop levitation and soup cans provide satisfying visual closure to temporal distortion.</comment>
