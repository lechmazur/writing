<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is palpable, but backstory and missionary aspect remain underdeveloped. The fork-as-key revelation partially illuminates motivation, though the transition from "hollow certainty" to transformative acceptance lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from concealment to mystical revelation despite tight constraints. The piano's pattern-decoding driving action works, though the chrysalis-to-constellation shift feels slightly abrupt. Completeness achieved through cyclical return to the fork's symbolic essence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Desert's prismatic glass, monarch's frayed flight, and piano's rusted dissonance create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details immerse; the setting actively shapes action (mirrors beneath dunes) rather than merely adorning it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("faith as wound") resonate. Ending subverts expectations while reinforcing theme. Subtext about doubt-as-truth carrier is potent. The line "voice became wind" elegantly merges narrative and metaphysical layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking originality in glass-desert imagery and fork's celestial reappearance. Avoids clich√© with "constellation shaped like a fork." Some phrases ("skeletally behemoth") dip toward ornate excess, minor AI-like rhythm hiccups.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere through symbolic unity. Briefness enhances mythic quality. Lingering question about nature of "open wounds" as spiritual vessels elevates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
