<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (unifying fractured hearts through mineralized memory) are conceptually compelling but undercut by underdeveloped psychological complexity; while actions align with traits, the protagonist’s internal logic remains frustratingly opaque.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc from parole hearing to dissolution of control is cohesive but strained by compressed pacing; cause-effect between mineralization process and structural collapse feels overly contrived despite clever moon-cycle repetition device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned drive-in as liminal space of failed spectacle merges brilliantly with circus surrealism; sensory details (greasepaint evaporation, warped calliope music) create an immersive, hallucinatory atmosphere that elevates the concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphoric mineralization of regret as both literal and emotional process delivers impactful emotional resonance; ending’s thematic revelation about acceptance lacks the narrative weight needed for maximum impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inventive grotesque imagery (bone tent poles, smoke-performers) and philosophical depth; occasionally veers into ornate description but maintains stylistic originality and emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story’s ambition exceeds its execution—elements integrate well but fail to coalesce into transcendent whole; effective compression of themes within limited space, but final emotional payoff doesn’t fully justify surreal scaffolding.</comment>
