<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (overcoming prejudice) is clear but development feels abrupt; the "Professional Cuddler" role isn't deeply tied to the narrative, and emotional shifts lack layered nuance despite the pivotal scene.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc and thematic resolution, but the tight word limit strains the transition between time-travel mechanics and thematic payoff—pacing stumbles slightly in balancing exposition and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "lavender honey," "gravity heavy with void") merge decay with commerce effectively; the spaceport's duality as ruin and community anchor is atmospheric but occasionally undercut by over-reliance on clichéd juxtapositions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotional impact is strong in key moments (e.g., the memory reveal), but relies heavily on visual/tactile "showing" while under-exploring subtext; the ending's thematic resonance feels slightly telegraphed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("ghost trains humming a chord"), but contains slightly over-polished phrasing that veers toward predictability; character reasoning skews logical (prejudice → empathy) without fully exploring psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Story coheres thanks to tight thematic focus, but the constrained length forces some narrative shortcuts; the union of speculative elements with emotional themes is clever yet occasionally strained under brevity.</comment>
