<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (decoding maps, surviving) are clear but psychological depth remains superficial; reactions to discoveries lack emotional nuance beyond stoic determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Action (decoding) drives plot but solstice climax feels compressed; pacing balances tension and revelation well despite word constraints, though the drone arrival seems abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere created through vivid sensory fusion of salt, decay, and spectral imagery; setting intrinsically shapes both plot and character’s urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>End evokes existential dread and defiance; strong use of symbolism (keys as warnings, stars as weapons) but emotional resonance is diluted by underdeveloped themes of human folly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar post-war dystopia tropes; imagery (e.g., "blade-calm") feels crafted, though some phrases ("warped by centuries") lean generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Compelling premise and atmosphere outweighs underexplored character arcs; constrained format sacrifices resolution but maintains cohesion through cyclical imagery (key dissolving, drones returning).</comment>
