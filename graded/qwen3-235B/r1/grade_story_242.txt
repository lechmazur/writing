<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character voice distinct but underexplored. Motivations hinted through plot mechanics (bridging cultures, family betrayal) but lack visceral emotional grounding. Reactions to objects like herbs feel symbolic but not psychologically authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by revelations but occasionally rushed. Logical cause-effect between the photo discovery and climax works, though some beats (AI teaching weeping) feel compressed. Circular structure with stranger returns satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hyper-sensory immersion in decaying analog world; herbs, 1940s exchange, and Vault artifacts create tangible nostalgia. Atmosphere mirrors thematic tension between preservation and progress.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (call bridges, wire as reconciliation) resonate. Subtext about listening as revolutionary act powerful. Ending avoids tidy resolution but leaves theme fully developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh inventions (dial tone dirges, AI weeping over vinyl) avoid genre clichés. Language occasionally luxuriates in itself (“broken piano” laugh) but maintains human nuance beneath lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements fused organically into thematically urgent narrative. Worldbuilding serves plot; brevity intensifies stakes. Ending lingers as meditation on memory’s role in progress.</comment>
