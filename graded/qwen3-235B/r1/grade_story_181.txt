<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear but lack depth; the sudden romantic tension and emotional shifts feel underdeveloped and inconsistent with sparse personality establishment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic arc but feels rushed—key revelations and emotional pivots occur abruptly, undermining tension. The timeframe constraint compromises resolution of core conflicts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush sensory details create immersive atmosphere; the bird sanctuary’s aural and tactile textures amplify nostalgia and loss, though setting integration with plot remains superficial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasional fresh metaphors undercut by formulaic phrasing ("whispering secrets older than the library’s dust") and abrupt tonal shifts; creativity is unevenly executed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements are mechanically incorporated but lack synthesis; story leans on aesthetic density over narrative cohesion, resulting in fragmented thematic resonance.</comment>
