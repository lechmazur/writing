<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation (revenge via genetic decoding) is clear but inconsistent with assigned "measured" trait; actions feel impulsive. Personality reveals itself through interactions with organic-synthetic duality but lacks deep emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing tightens in final quarter with abrupt tonal shifts; cause-effect logic holds despite density. Some narrative jumps (giggling child) feel undermotivated within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Organically synthetic decay creates immersive, tactile dread. "Nectar-scented sludge" and pulsing cellulose veins exemplify powerful juxtaposition of natural/artificial. Atmosphere flawlessly amplifies thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "taxidermy of hope" and moth-as-avenger show ingenuity. Ending's transformation theme resonates, but internalized enzyme conflict could be more visceral. Dialogue sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through biological horror lens. No purple prose despite ornate concepts; emotional stakes implicit rather than stated. Occasional abstraction ("abrasive calm") risks vagueness but mostly succeeds.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (genetic theft, synthetic corruption) interlocked for thematic unity. Brief length accentuates descent-into-chaos pacing. Ending implies cyclical struggle but doesn't fully resolve core tension.</comment>
