<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Therapist's motivation (anchoring the ephemeral) is clear but lacks emotional depth, psychological nuance, or moral complexity. The hive-mind collective feels underexplored as a characterizing force. Recruits function more as abstract entities than distinct individuals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression through candle-wax-based draining maintains coherence within the compressed timeline, but stakes remain vague. The infiltration mission lacks specific consequences. Pacing surges during technical descriptions while emotional beats feel abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (wax glyphs, sparking plug, lithium battery taste) and auditory motifs ("sound of hindsight"). The clandestine facility's decayed technology creates tangible tension between analog methods and quantum threats.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (wax as memory architecture, charger as trauma anchor) offer sophisticated symbolic resonance. Themes of sanctioned psychological erasure and memory's commodification emerge powerfully. The final requiem-as-erasure image lingers disturbingly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through hybrid metaphors (hive-mind therapist, candle-wax cryptography), though some phrases ("merry bitterness") border on affectation. Slight artificiality in therapist's clinical detachment vs. the emotional gravity of their actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly into the narrative core, particularly the charger-candle-wax interplay. Limited character scope and compressed timeframe feel intentional rather than restrictive. Lingering questions about systemic ethics add thematic depth.</comment>
