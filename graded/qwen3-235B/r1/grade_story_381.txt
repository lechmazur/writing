<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (duty over personal gain), and reactions to objects/elements reveal nuance (cap as identity marker, Jarek's hologram as emotional anchor). Dialogue and internal tension ("rewrite past vs. chart voids") establish a distinct voice that balances cryptic resolve with vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a micro-arc: quake as rising action, stabilization as climax, collapse and determination as resolution. The assigned action ("dominate") drives every choice, and cause-effect logic (quakes = instability needing intervention) remains consistent. Pacing within constraints feels deliberate, not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is meticulous: crystalline cave/time-pool visuals, sensory fusion of quartz-crunch and movie-reverberating glows, and the cap’s tactile contrast with necromantic glyphs immerse readers. Atmosphere merges futuristic tech (holograms) with analog nostalgia (20th-century film), enhancing both character motivation and thematic tension between eras.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story evokes existential awe through metaphors (caves as "requiem for futures un-lived"), layered subtext (mapping as salvation vs. self-erasure), and resonant contrasts (ancient cap vs. quantum time-pools). Ending’s duality—imminent unraveling vs. dogged persistence—feels emotionally and thematically satisfying, avoiding clichéd triumph while maintaining tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While original in concept blending necromancy with cinema-as-temporal-glue, occasional phrases ("sound like resolve itself") edge toward abstract vagueness. Dialogue avoids stiltedness, but Jarek’s glitch-humor occasionally undercuts somber tone. No purple prose, but some descriptors ("fractured memories of a future that hadn’t happened yet") strain toward grandeur without full grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements (scuffed cap, "scarcely abundant" resources) are tightly woven into plot logic and theme. The brevity feels purposeful, amplifying urgency rather than limiting coherence. The story lingers through its meditation on sacrifice and the paradox of mapping chaos, suggesting deeper implications without over-explaining.</comment>
