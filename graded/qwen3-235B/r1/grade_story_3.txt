<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's surly nature lacks depth; motivations implied through cosmic pattern-seeking but underdeveloped. Actions tie to assigned traits but inner conflict remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Riddle drives the plot effectively; yarn unraveling as cosmic method makes sense. Pacing uneven—specter confrontation rushes resolution despite atmospheric buildup. Clear arc but feels truncated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting's graveyard and limbo time create haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (kelp crunch, brine specter) immerse readers. Connection between yarn craft and nautical setting enhances theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (yarn as cosmic ledger) and layered meaning elevate the text. Ending resonates thematically, reframing "market wisdom" as existential balance. Evocative prose with strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "celestial hitch") avoid clichés, but some phrases ("tides roared inland") verge on oversupply. Tone remains consistent; emotional nuance implied through imagery rather than explicit tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly despite constraints. Yarn and riddle drive both plot and theme, while limbo setting amplifies existential tension. Ambiguous ending lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
