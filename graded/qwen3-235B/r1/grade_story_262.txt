<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character’s duality as alien/teacher is intriguing but underexplored; motivation to rescue knowledge is clear but her internal conflict with being "righteously flawed" lacks depth. The tile reveals purpose but doesn’t fully interrogate her flaws. Dialogue feels poetic rather than personally distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegant cause/effect (tile activates bathhouse), but pacing compresses key moments (e.g., organ’s role feels underdeveloped). The arc from silence to revelation is satisfying, though abrupt transitions (e.g., holograms appearing) leave little space for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid synesthesia of sound/light merges Roman and cosmic motifs effectively. Mosaic and steam provide tactile/spatial immediacy, though the "lone organ" motif could be more atmospheric. The bathhouse’s rebirth as a temple of knowledge is evocative but risks feeling schematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("liquid gold", "night-blooming cereus") deepen themes of preservation/renewal. Ending’s circularity (silence at start/end) underscores the message, though the final dialogue risks sentimentality. Subtext about decoding trauma through art elevates the piece.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but treads the edge of "purple prose" (e.g., "twin hearts" feels contrived). The fusion of historical and sci-fi is inventive, yet some phrases ("fractured starlight") border on cliché. Emotions are shown through action but occasionally flattened by overly abstract language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements interlock persuasively (tile/mosaic/organ), though the "concerts" timeframe feels peripheral. The brevity suits the mythic tone but sacrifices character nuance. Lingering impact comes from its thematic fusion of memory and resistance.</comment>
