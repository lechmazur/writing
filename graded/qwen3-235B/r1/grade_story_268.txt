<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (mastering Axiomancy, war trauma) is clear but lacks deeper psychological nuance; actions align with traits, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from surveillance to confrontation to resolution; pacing is tight but occasionally strained by compressed word count, slight inconsistency in assassin’s introduction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details (cracked vinyl, hissing rain, humming beads) and thematic alignment between the war-ravaged setting and Lena’s fractured psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Innovative use of metaphors (lies as serpents, silence as violence), layered subtext, and visceral imagery elevate the narrative; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with original concepts (Axiomancy, bead-tech hybrid); avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on familiar “traumatized vigilante” tropes without full subversion.</comment>
