<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially obscured by narrative brevity; the exorcist's trauma is hinted at but insufficiently woven into his active decisions, while Voss lacks substantive internal logic for her antagonism. The "inwardly social" attribute surfaces in a single line rather than shaping ongoing behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crammed structure suffers from artificial compression - transitions between puzzles and revelations feel rushed, undermining causality. The dance lesson framework's thematic connection to the climax (Voss's "checkmate") is underdeveloped, creating narrative gaps that compromise the arc's cohesion within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viscerally effective atmosphere through precise sensory details like ozone tang and drowned starlight fluid. The psychic research facility's synthetic science-meets-occult environment is masterfully rendered, with architecture itself serving as narrative device. Timeframe integration through dance lessons creates intriguing juxtaposition of banality and horror.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric resonance between dance/exorcism and science/mysticism with "tangoing with the night wind" as particularly evocative. Dialogue (Voss's "science needs specters") and physical symbolism (light-dissolving girl) carry multiple interpretive layers. Ending's thematic payoff about cages and freedom is emotionally satisfying, though character emotional journeys remain thin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Successfully subverts exorcist tropes by merging them with quantum research rather than just replicating priestly horror routines. Some phrases ("tangible dread", "drowned starlight") risk poetic overreach, but the central conceit of puzzles-as-psychological-trauma remains refreshingly inventive within genre constraints. The "dance with both logic and lightning" resolution avoids easy answers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive synthesis of assigned elements that elevate rather than constrain - particularly the postcard's evolving role and dance lessons' narrative function. The tight word limit benefits the story's enigmatic quality, suggesting deeper thematic layers to explore beyond the explicit text. Technical execution demonstrates editorial polish.</comment>
