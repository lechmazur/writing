<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Symbolic but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth. The "aggressively kind" trait feels imposed rather than organically expressed through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion between opening and resolution, but pacing strains under the tight word limit. Some transitions (whale call to dancer’s actions) feel abrupt rather than causally inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere with precise sensory details (crumbling stones, whale song, storm), though the fusion of modern dancer and haunted lighthouse risks dissonance the story only partially resolves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered themes (tradition as a current, memory as tidal) elevate the story. The ending’s emotional resonance is undercut slightly by abstract detachment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction ("salt-stained silence") that edges toward ornamentation rather than precision. Emotional subtext is shown but occasionally diluted by archaic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize thematically but occasionally strain plausibility (whistle’s sentience). The story’s brevity aids thematic focus but leaves some narrative gaps unresolved.</comment>
