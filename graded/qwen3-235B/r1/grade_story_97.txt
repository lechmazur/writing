<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character’s transformation from logic-driven to empathetic is clear and tied to the compass. Motivation to navigate forgotten places aligns with traits, though the urgency of her change could feel rushed. Distinct voice through internal monologue elevates.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of emotional evolution, driven by visions. Pacing is slightly compressed but logical; the compass’s guidance ties the beginning and end. Fissures as transitions are inventive. Some abrupt shifts in imagery, but momentum is maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Surreal, unstable dimension and "whispered minute" are evocatively rendered with sensory details (lullabies, mending wings). The atmosphere directly mirrors the oracle’s internal journey, enhancing theme. Strong synergy between setting and object.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("time folded like origami") and subtext about empathy as healing resonate. The ending’s reflection on shared wounds elevates it beyond plot. Shows rather than tells emotions, though occasional ornate phrasing risks overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Few obvious clichés; metaphors like "compass needle" are inventive. Sensory details are specific, though "desperately casual" feels slightly contrived. Emotional nuance is shown through actions (e.g., digging nails), avoiding flatness. Language is mostly purposeful with minor purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated with theme. Brevity feels deliberate, emphasizing emotional beats. Ending lingers with philosophical resonance. No loose threads; each image serves cohesion and the central idea of empathy as restoration.</comment>
