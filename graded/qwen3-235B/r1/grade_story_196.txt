<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Persistent emotional armor creates credible inertia; final action feels earned after seven years. Flashbacks and physical gestures (carved ribs, top-spinning) subtly reinforce trauma and its release, though secondary characters lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical meteor trajectory perfectly bridges ascetic stasis and cathartic action within tight word count. The monastery-to-forge progression is visually and thematically cohesive, though the leap into space merits one additional sentence for visceral physics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Monastic austerity meets celestial violence beautifully - incense ash against void, melting swords into lunar soil. The forge's gravity-defying top creates haunting dissonance, though the 'knowing naivety' tone occasionally falters in cosmic-scale descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Burned sword as literal and metaphorical release achieves emotional subtext; top's reappearance creates mythic resonance. Some similes (like "nettles") feel under-developed compared to richer metaphors, but overall prose sings with restrained urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rare balance of lyrical compression and narrative clarity. Avoids trope of redemptive violence by destroying the weapon rather than using it. Sensory economy (scar matching meteor trails) surpasses typical AI descriptors, though minor overuse of adverbs lingers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterclass in thematic concision - each element interrelates (apathy/defiance, promise/choice, orbit/trajectory). Leaves lingering questions about monastic cosmology and sibling history without sacrificing completion, exceeding expectations for short form storytelling.</comment>
