<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is vividly portrayed through mannerisms and dialogue, but motivation for escaping the wasteland lacks deeper psychological nuance despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within constraints, but the transition from office to wasteland edge feels slightly rushed despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (ink, dust, red-ink constellations) create immersive atmosphere; the decoder's office feels like a liminal space between reality and dream.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (knitting as forgetting, dance as memory); ending resonates thematically. Subtext about mapping inner/outer journeys elevates tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s overall, though "desolate wasteland" leans generic. Metaphors (e.g., metronome-clicking needles) feel fresh, but some phrases flirt with poetic excess without losing impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate well but occasionally strain plausibility. Certain descriptors ("illogically logical") feel conceptually underexplored despite otherwise deliberate pacing.</comment>
