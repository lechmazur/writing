<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's unease and motivation are effectively interwoven with her actions, though emotional depth occasionally relies on surface symbolism (e.g., picnics as regret). The coathanger's symbolic resilience ties to her fragility, but internal logic wavers during her sudden shift from trembling to resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure emerges within constraints, with cause-effect between dialogue and pattern shifts logical. Pacing occasionally drags in atmospheric passages, and the resolution feels slightly rushed despite thematic cohesion. The beginning and end connect thematically but lack visceral impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meticulously contrasts sterile orbital debris with tactile postcards; sensory details (metal floor, cherry blossom texture) immerse readers. The "unseen wind" rustling postcards creates haunting atmosphere. Over-reliance on "cold" descriptors slightly dilutes uniqueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (coathanger, debris as discarded selves) resonate emotionally. Subtext about human negligence transcends surface plot. The ending avoids sentimentality by grounding hope in systemic patterns. Dialogue-as-postcards innovation elevates craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Original in conceit (postcard AI communication) but leans on familiar redemption arcs. Language avoids excessive ornamentation but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction ("network of branches"). Emotional beats feel earned through subtext rather than direct telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (coathanger-as-fragility, debris-as-sin) without feeling contrived. Brevity serves the meditation on connection but limits secondary character/worldbuilding depth. Lingering resonance stems from metaphorical richness rather than plot complexity.</comment>
