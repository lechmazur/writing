<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character exists as a vessel for resolving the plot, not a fully-realized human. Motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond surface-level artistic longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid three-act structure within word constraints, though resolution feels overly neat. Pacing avoids dragging but relies on familiar mythic arc mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transcendent sensory details (obsidian eyes, vibrating plants) create unforgettable atmosphere. Forest glade becomes an active character through vivid, layered descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (silence as imprisonment/chorus), but lacks subtextual depth. Ending achieves emotional payoff through musical motif repetition rather than new insight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s through specific botanical/music fusion, but still contains tropish mystical guide figure. Language occasionally dips into ornamental excess without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements functionally interwoven, but brief length exaggerates plot simplicity. Conceptual elegance lingers more than narrative depth, suggesting surface-level thematic ambition.</comment>
