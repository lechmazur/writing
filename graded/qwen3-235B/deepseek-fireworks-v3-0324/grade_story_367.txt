<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character shows nuanced struggle but motivation (studying tide patterns) feels underdeveloped; internal conflict through interactions with objects and nature but voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Circular structure from weariness to acceptance exists but pacing feels rushed; transitions between realizations could be smoother for tighter coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ocean sounds, cracked bellows) immerse reader; tone of indifference matches theme but connection between bellows and setting feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors effective but not groundbreaking; some purple prose in descriptions (e.g., "thoughtfully thoughtless"), reliance on predictable emotional beats weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements like the goose and bellows feel shoehorned; theme of imperfection resonates but length limits depth; ending lingers but cohesion is uneven.</comment>
