<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's sentimentality and spontaneity lack concrete behavioral manifestations; motivations tied to justice remain abstract rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through assigned elements but feels compartmentalized; the coordinates' abrupt introduction disrupts narrative cohesion despite poetic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mesopotamian setting provides vivid sensory texture, but the Sumerian palace's historical weight remains underexploited; atmosphere occasionally overwhelms contextual specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "hairpin as compass") elevates thematic resonance; ending delivers philosophical closure but lacks emotional stickiness amid lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stylized prose occasionally veers into purple territory ("dripping with chaotic humility," "storm clouds" metaphor repetition); conceptual themes overshadow nuanced character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story integrates all elements technically, but some (anchor's lifting, coordinates) feel imposed rather than organic; thematic ambition outpaces narrative depth.</comment>
