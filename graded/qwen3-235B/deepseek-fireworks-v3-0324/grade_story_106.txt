<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's sullenness is evident but underexplored; motivation to escape dead ends drives actions, but emotional nuance remains surface-level despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean arc from stagnation to resolve; postage stamp action pivotal yet constrained by brevity. Pacing uneven—some transitions abrupt but overall coherence maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eerie, tactile atmosphere with rust/water/salt sensations; setting's decay mirrors character's psyche. Object-setting synergy strong—quilt/turbines/stamps create immersive, symbolic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (quilt as life map, fading stamps as false ideals) potent. Ending resonates thematically; emotional subtext layered through objects rather than explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original integration of elements avoids formula; some phrases verge on ornate ("borrowed valor") but generally purposeful. Emotional beats shown through objects, not stated—strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements tightly interwoven (quilt, stamps, setting); length highlights focus rather than limitation. Lingering theme of self-authorship emerges clearly despite concise delivery.</comment>
