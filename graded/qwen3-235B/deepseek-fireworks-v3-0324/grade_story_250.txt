<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but thinly explored; character's actions align with the assigned traits but lack depth beyond "heretic vs. divine" framework.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but feels slightly contrived; key revelations hinge on arbitrary elements (e.g., stock ticker) without full narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but tonally inconsistent; blending mystical temple with stock ticker lacks thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective use of symbols (teddy bear, key) and cyclical ending; lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept (heretic vs. omniscient code), but relies on "puzzle-solving protagonist" trope; some phrases ("old promises") verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but uneven; high-concept ideas clash at times, yet the compact structure and unexpected fusion of mystical/modern elements linger.</comment>
