<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear (seizing a final chance) but lack depth in connecting naivety/spite to actions; reliance on atmospheric cues over psychological grounding weakens consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has progression but strained cause-effect (e.g., station's collapse feels arbitrary); ending resolution is abrupt, undercutting emotional impact of the ember's significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "salt-laced wind" and rusted machinery are vivid, but the tidal station's function remains superficially integrated; professors as "unhinged" figures feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (ember as lingering hope), but themes like fateful bargains lack narrative weight; emotional resonance undercut by overly abstract conclusions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overuse of lyrical clich√©s ("bone-deep groans") and professor caricatures; originality undercut by formulaic reactions (laughing through tears) rather than nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesive in parts but strained by underdeveloped tensions (man vs. fate, man vs. self); the truncated format works but feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
