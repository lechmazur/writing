<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, lacking distinct voice or motivation beyond vague philosophical yearning. Internal conflict is stated, not demonstrated through concrete actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels static; cosmic events and character's gestures lack cause-effect logic. Pacing uneven, with abrupt shifts between introspection and surreal phenomena.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative—marble, reflections, cosmic weight—all amplify the thematic tension between order and chaos. Sensory details immerse but occasionally overshadow narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storytelling is rich with metaphor (mask, sparrow, reflections) and subtext about passive power. Ending resonates conceptually, though emotional impact is subdued by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in symbolizing nonviolence through fragility, but prose veers into overwrought lyricism. Avoids clichés in theme but occasionally falters in balancing poetic style with narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story coheres aesthetically but struggles with accessibility. Assigned elements are tightly woven, yet the brevity limits thematic payoff. Lingering tone over concrete narrative closure.</comment>
