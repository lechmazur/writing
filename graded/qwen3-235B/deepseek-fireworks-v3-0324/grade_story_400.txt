<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth; the druid's internal conflict is present but not fully explored beyond surface grief and fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels abrupt; the ritual’s small scale works within the word limit but lacks momentum-building transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with precise, evocative details that immerse the reader; the glacial orchard’s harsh beauty and isolation strongly enhance mood and theme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes; prose is occasionally overwritten (e.g., “crevasse of blue ice”) but retains a distinctive voice and subtext about memory’s weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with purposeful brevity; the story’s existential tone and symbolic details linger, though its narrow emotional palette limits broader impact.</comment>
