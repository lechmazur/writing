<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's restlessness drives plot but lacks interiority; motivation to create is clear but his emotional stakes remain underexplored. Transformation feels abrupt without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to three-act structure but relies on contrivances like road closure; pacing effectively condensed yet resolution feels too pat, undercutting narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details (water echoes, icy plunge) but integration of pearls as "dormant stars" strains logic; setting enhances, doesn't fully inform, thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (reflection, blankness) and thematic coherence about creation vs. tradition; ending resonates but leans on familiar "discovery through adversity" tropes. Emotional impact genuine yet familiar.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in premise but falls into predictable beats (wise mentor, triumphant outsider); prose lush but occasionally overwritten ("layered tranquility"). Subtlety in character emotion counterbalances occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements overall; road closure and haggling scene strain plausibility. Brevity serves allegorical tone but limits depth, leaving theme more implied than fully realized.</comment>
