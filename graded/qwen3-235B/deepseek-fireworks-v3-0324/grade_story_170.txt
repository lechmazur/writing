<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's free-spirited nature is shown through her blending of art/science, but lacks deeper motivations and psychological complexity. Emotional journey from doubt to hope feels somewhat simplified but generally consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear arc from despair to hope with logical cause-effect, though transformation feels somewhat contrived. Pacing works for short form but misses nuance in key emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective sensory details establish setting, particularly in depicting the coral station's decay and contrasting it with hope. Timeframe creates meaningful metaphor but could be more concretely developed.</comment>
