<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character consistently rebellious, motivation clear, but lacks emotional depth or complexity; actions align with traits but aren't deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from exploration to climax, but word limit creates rushed pacing in key moments; resolution feels abrupt but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evoke setting through vivid imagery, but some elements (labyrinth, revolution) lack full integration; sensory details are evocative but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (organ as resurrection of memory) are potent; ending lingers thematically. Tension between memory and revolution resonates, though emotional payoff is restrained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but "labyrinth of choices" and revolution feel conceptually generic; prose is stylistically bold without veering into purple prose, though some transitions strain logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but not always synergistic; brevity amplifies poetic impact but sacrifices nuance. Leaves lingering questions about memory’s power but feels conceptually fragmented.</comment>
