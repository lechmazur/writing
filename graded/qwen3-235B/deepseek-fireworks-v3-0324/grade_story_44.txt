<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stablehand’s feistiness and redemption arc are clear but underdeveloped; motivations hinted at through dialogue but lack emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but transitions (e.g., carnival projection) feel abrupt; pacing efficient but momentum occasionally stalls.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes space salvage and ancient magic, but sensory details uneven—e.g., stardust and shifting engravings contrast with vague descriptions of the studio.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mix of metaphor (lamp as redemption) and subtext works; ending resonates, but central conflict (past vs. future) feels thinly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evasive of clichés (space-studio meets carnival magic); some awkward shifts (e.g., lamp’s sudden glow), but fresh fusion of elements avoids formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>ELEMENTS are integrated but unevenly weighted; tone and theme linger, yet the story’s ambition outpaces its concise structure.</comment>
