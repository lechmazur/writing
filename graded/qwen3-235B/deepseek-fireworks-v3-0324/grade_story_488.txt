<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct 'voice' or emotional subtlety—motivation exists as concept but feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded. No meaningful development occurs through the action, relying on symbolic weight</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Chronological structure is clear but compressed; tension created by impeding demolition drives momentum. Resolution feels abrupt—could benefit from earlier establishment of consequences</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere has striking visuals (ozone scent, crumbling map) but setting feels decorative rather than integral. 'Quantum' elements never fully intersect with character or plot logic</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors about creation and self-destruction, ending lingers with philosophical ambiguity. Strong showing of paradox through physicalized doppelgänger rather than exposition</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Some purple prose tendencies ("fractured time" sand) and reliance on Gothic tropes, but quantum beach setting introduces fresh conceptual texture. Avoids total formulaicity through thematic cohesion</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements serve theme but unevenly integrated—condemned building's collapse feels more symbolic than narratively necessary. Lingering questions about ambition's cost provide thematic weight</comment>
