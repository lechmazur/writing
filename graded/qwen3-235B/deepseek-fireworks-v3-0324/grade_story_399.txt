<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness feels underexplored, but inner trauma drives coherent arc. Motivation (quelling internal uprising) is clear but could better align with overt actions beyond crypt-tending. Reaction to the tube reveals depth, though voice remains vaguely archetypal rather than distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from entry to catharsis, using the tube's revelation as pivotal action. Concept of trauma structures the arc, though pacing slightly drags in middle paragraphs. Atmospheric shifts sufficiently drive progression; word count constraints only minimally compromise narrative fullness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting, sensorially rich atmosphere (crystal vibrations, scuffing boots) masterfully immerses. However, "grandiose subtlety" occasionally overreaches with poetic abstractions. Timeframe of stargazing effectively merges with cosmic imagery to enhance spiritual reckoning within the witch's crystalline setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evasive metaphor ("trauma etched deeper than mandala grooves") and collapsing mandala imagery powerfully convey internal fragmentation. Ending resonates thematically rather than feeling contrived. Subtextual connection between caretaking profession and suppressed grief elevates emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("stars pulsed like distant wounds") and reliance on mystical tropes (witch, mandalas) border on clich√©. Sensory details generally specific but occasionally overadorned. Emotional nuance arises more through symbolic objects than raw psychological specificity, slightly distancing reader.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit psychological catharsis. Brief length emphasizes thematic compression rather than feeling restricted. Style balances poetic clarity with mystical ambiguity. Ending lingers with thematic resonance about trauma's alchemy rather than merely resolving plot.</comment>
