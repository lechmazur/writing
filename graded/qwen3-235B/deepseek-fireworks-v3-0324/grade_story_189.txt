<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits (literal mind, determination) surface in actions but lack psychological depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through complex emotional reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear plot hits required beats but feels compressed; pacing uneven with underdeveloped cause-effect between key insertion and cosmic aftermath.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually immersive with textured sensory details; haunted lighthouse's decay and celestial machinery create haunting contrast that amplifies narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance (key-as-destiny) and lyrical prose, but emotional gravity undercut by overly expositionary dialogue; ending lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through surreal combinations (phone booth key + algae) but relies on post-apocalyptic tropes; metaphors fresh but occasionally overwritten (e.g., "whispers of drowned sailors").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Compelling fragments of deeper themes (sacrifice for knowledge) exist, but structural compression flattens their potential impact; cohesive but not transcendent.</comment>
