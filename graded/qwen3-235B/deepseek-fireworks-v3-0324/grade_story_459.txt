<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Protagonist Eli’s grief and spectral burden are emotionally resonant, but secondary characters lack dimension. The scientist’s abrupt epiphany feels underdeveloped, leaning on narrative shorthand rather than organic interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Solid three-act compression within word limits, but transitions between the elevator, lab, and ocean lack rhythmic cohesion. The dénouement feels rushed, softening the emotional impact of Eli’s release.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in eerie juxtapositions (mechanical elevators vs. fragile sand castles) and sensory contrasts (brittle petals, ocean salt). Lab descriptions lean stylized rather than visceral, sacrificing some immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (tides dissolving memory) and metaphor (futility of preservation) are potent, elevated by lyrical prose. Emotional undercurrents rely slightly too heavily on poetic abstraction over grounded character action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise with haunting grace notes (e.g., sand scientists’ “elegant clumsiness”). Some phrases (“whispering secrets”) edge toward cliché, but the core fusion of decay and repair feels fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherence amidst formal constraints is impressive, though brevity strains secondary stakes. The story’s thematic engine (impermanence) resonates, but the emotional arc could deepen.</comment>
