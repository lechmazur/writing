<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: Clear motivation tied to father’s legacy. Weakness: Flighty trait inconsistently portrayed; resolve emerges abruptly without layered development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength: Plot structure follows a clear arc; linearizing drives action. Weakness: Pacing relies on summary in key moments (e.g., elders’ shifting reactions) rather than dramatized progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Evocative sensory details (grease-stained patch, shimmering paintings) enhance immersion. Weakness: "Secret society" setting remains generic; lacks distinctive worldbuilding beyond surface aesthetics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors ("flicker of unity," "flame") and theme of memory preservation resonate. Weakness: Emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown (e.g., "serene anger" stated but not embodied).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strength: Unique use of paintings as maps avoids cliché. Weakness: Phrases like "whispering secrets" and ending star alignment veer toward overfamiliar imagery; tone sometimes oscillates between mythic and mundane without cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength: Elements cohere around legacy and reinterpretation. Weakness: Short form exposes structural seams (e.g., sudden elder uncertainty); thematic depth hinted at but not fully excavated.</comment>
