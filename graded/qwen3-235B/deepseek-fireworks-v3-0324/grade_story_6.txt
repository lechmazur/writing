<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's skepticism is consistent but lacks nuance; motivations are clear but simplistically tied to survival and coin rather than layered with bardic complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc but relies on contrived mechanisms (e.g., slingshot-triggered steam flood) that strain plausibility despite fitting the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but uneven—sensory details enrich the factory yet undercut the disappearing ink concept, which is underutilized beyond plot device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storytelling employs effective metaphors and tension, but the theme of vanishing promises remains surface-level, undermining deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending steampunk and trickster lore, though occasional over-description (e.g., "irreverent awe") borders on purple prose without losing stylistic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but uneven—some (slingshot, dragon-scale) drive the narrative, while others (midday timeframe) feel decorative rather than vital.</comment>
