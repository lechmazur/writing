<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (revenge for sister's fate) but the connection between being a tense bodyguard and his actions feels underexplored; his defining trait of tension lacks nuance, while the "serene anger" is stated rather than embodied through layered behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (planning to escape) but pacing relies on underdeveloped transitions (e.g., fragments of overheard stories shaping the plan); some cause-effect logic feels rushed (chaos from sabotaged oxygen regulators goes unexplored).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse's sensory details (damp air, starlit plants) create vivid atmosphere, but its symbolic role as "rebirth" feels imposed rather than organically tied to the plot; the crater-edge setting lacks functional connection to the character's choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., fury "colder than vacuum") elevates the theme, but the ending's simplistic "smile" and shift from anger to hope feel unearned; the central tension lacks subtext about rebellion's cost.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Certain phrases ("earth’s pale glow," "fragile oasis") showcase stylistic precision, but others border on cliché ("quiet fury," "thrill of rebirth"); emotional states are often stated rather than revealed through action, and some sensory details (swaying leaves as "silent allies") strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story coalesces around escape but never transcends genre tropes (photograph-as-motivation, lunar dystopia); the compressed form feels restrictive rather than deliberate, with underused potential in the rebirth metaphor and political subtext.</comment>
