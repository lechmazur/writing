<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "mild curiosity" contradicts intense actions; motivation to honor an impossible promise lacks psychological complexity. Limited distinct voice despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise drives plot but pacing uneven - too much abstraction undermines structural clarity. Temporal connections exist but resolution feels ephemeral rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually potent setting with effective sensory immersion through metallic decay and atmospheric phenomena. The graveyard's physicality anchors more abstract themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric treatment of time/space with memorable imagery, though emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction. Central theme of fragmented memory emerges clearly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but borders on poetic vagueness. Metaphors initially fresh (rain as storm) yet some descriptors verge on ornamental excess without clear narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Cohesive but overly reliant on atmospheric abstraction. Elements combine aesthetically yet struggle to create tangible narrative momentum within compressed form.</comment>
