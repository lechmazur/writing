<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through inventive fusion of steampunk and quantum aesthetics; "interconnected wishes" concept feels underexplored, drifting toward mystical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story coalesces thematically but struggles with brevity's constraints; the final image of fragile renewal lingers, though deeper character and worldbuilding potential remain untapped.</comment>
