<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s guilt and desire for escape are consistent but understated; the drawer knob and setting evoke interiority effectively, but motivation remains more implied than fully embodied through action or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from reflection to catharsis; the drawer knob’s disposal drives resolution coherently. Pacing compresses the arc tightly but manages a clear beginning/middle/end within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting details (prismatic lake, squeaking seesaw, construction) create vivid, symbolic atmosphere that enhances mood and thematic contrasts between decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elicits subtle emotional resonance through understated imagery (e.g., “hollow applause”) and layered metaphors. Ends with quiet thematic payoff, though avoids deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but risks familiar tropes (guilt-as-object, water-as-purification). Sensory details are specific but occasionally verge on formulaic poeticism without subversive edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a melancholic meditation on release; the brevity works as a deliberate choice. Lingers emotionally but lacks ambition in expanding beyond its confined premise.</comment>
