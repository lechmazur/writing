<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations align with phobic tendencies and the stunt double profession hints at risk-taking. However, internal depth remains surface-level despite consistent actions; Lena's transformation feels abrupt without fully earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion within constraints with clear beginning-to-end progression, though the climax and resolution feel slightly rushed despite logical cause-effect relationships. The pyramid's test structure is conceptually tight but lacks nuanced pacing variation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative but familiar desert-pyramid imagery creates atmosphere, though sensory details lean on archetypal descriptors ("whispers," "crumbling shelves") rather than uniquely tailored specifics. The setting supports tone but occasionally defaults to adventure-genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (net as fear, mirrors as transformation) elevate thematic resonance. Ending delivers satisfying closure through contrast between phobia and triumph, though some emotional beats rely on explicit descriptions rather than organic showing through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, certain phrases ("edge of madness," "dancing" as metaphor) and the spiritual-revelation arc tread familiar territory without sharp subversion. Sensory details occasionally veer toward efficient rather than distinctive atmospheric choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a compact narrative with strong elemental integration, though its brevity compresses emotional growth somewhat unnaturally. Final lines suggest thematic ambition exceeding the depth achievable within spatial constraints.</comment>
