<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character functions more as symbolic archetype than three-dimensional figure. Motivations tied to vulnerability/strength dichotomy are conceptually clear but psychologically thin. Actions align with assigned traits but lack nuanced human contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains internal coherence with clear arc of confession and punishment, but relies heavily on atmospheric tension rather than character-driven momentum. Pacing feels slightly rushed despite effective beginning-middle-end structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting merges Gothic decay with jungle encroachment masterfully. Sensory details (mildew/peeling wallpaper/vines) create oppressive atmosphere that shapes character motivations and thematic resonance through environmental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (bottle cap as hypocrisy) and subtext (unspoken agreements as moral decay). Ending achieves thematic closure while maintaining existential ambiguity. Writing style effectively blends poetic texture with narrative precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While prose avoids overt formulaic patterns, atmospheric descriptions occasionally echo Gothic clich√©s. Symbolism feels deliberate rather than derivative, but emotional resonance relies partly on genre conventions rather than radical originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements with thematically consistent arc. Lacks transcendent originality but offers polished execution. Lingering power comes more from effective trope employment than radical reinterpretation.</comment>
