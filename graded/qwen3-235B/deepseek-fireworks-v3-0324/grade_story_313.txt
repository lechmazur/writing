<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Finch's motivation as a con artist shaped by remorse is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his emotional contradictions. Dialogue reveals voice but falls short of fully embodying his deception-driven psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost interrogation drives the plot, but the transition from confrontation to acceptance feels slightly rushed despite a coherent arc. Pacing stumbles briefly during emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (rust, dust, ghostly whispers) and the dystopian/normal contrast masterfully immerse readers. Atmosphere deeply supports thematic tension between decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (tape/tape dispenser) and imagery evoke emotional resonance. Ending's subtlety and theme of self-reckoning surpass surface narrative. Subtext-rich interactions with ghosts elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with nuanced ghost symbolism and dystopian normalcy. Some phrasing ("hollow with regret") verges on generic. Emotional progression feels earned but occasionally explicit.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into Finch's introspective journey. Brevity enhances focus on his transformation. Lingering reflection on redemption elevates beyond technical constraints.</comment>
