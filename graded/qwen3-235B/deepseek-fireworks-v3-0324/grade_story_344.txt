<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths lie in Elias's fear-driven arc and Liora's cryptic wisdom; some underexplored motivations (e.g., why jams? 1918?) weaken consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight structure but forced progression: jams tasting as catalyst for healing feels contrived; abrupt shift from tea house to diving needs more connective tissue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (amber lanterns, smudged glasses) enrich the ethereal setting; "improbable beginnings" framing lacks thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (jam=memory, glasses=hope) elevate subtext; conclusion balances closure and ambiguity but risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh imagery avoids clich√©s, but occasional ornate phrasing ("inflaming memories") and Elias's abrupt bravery strain naturalism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly; the brief length works but leaves some threads (e.g., war jam) underutilized.</comment>
