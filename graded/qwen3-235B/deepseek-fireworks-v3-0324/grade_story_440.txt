<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's "detached" nature feels performative rather than organically demonstrated; motivation remains emotionally opaque despite metaphorical references to vow-making; reactions to objects like the sea pottery lack psychological depth that would make the promise feel viscerally urgent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on poetic associations rather than causal logic; the collage-reassembly method exists more as symbolic gesture than plot engine; temporal constraint creates tension between wanting emotional payoff and the reality of underdeveloped narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Futuristic recycling center's mechanical "playfulness" juxtaposes intriguingly with somber tone; sensory details like luminous pottery and humming machines create immersive dissonance; setting's potential as thematic metaphor slightly undercut by underutilized futuristic elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors ("secret weavers") resonate more than surface narrative; ending lacks emotional crescendo despite lyrical language; subtext about creation/destruction cycles competes with superficially sketched character psyche and relationship to "ghost."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids genre clich√©s but leans heavily on atmospheric abstraction over concrete originality; collage motif shows ingenuity but execution risks pretentiousness; emotional valence feels AI-generated in its preference for obfuscation over visceral connection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but not narratively - sea pottery, collage scraps and vow concept orbit similar thematic concerns without fusing into cohesive whole; brevity works against emotional stakes; lingering impact derives from mood more than substance.</comment>
