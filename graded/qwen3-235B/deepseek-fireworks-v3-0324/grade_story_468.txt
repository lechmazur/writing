<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are consistent and drive the plot, but lack emotional depth and complexity beyond the archetypal curious mortician. Dialogue and actions align with traits but leave little lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc with tight pacing, but the brevity forces abrupt transitions (e.g., spirit’s introduction and Elias’s disappearance). The ending connects to the beginning but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid, eerie sensory details that immerse readers. Setting enhances the plot, but the object-setting connection (e.g., bracelet’s history) remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (labyrinth as curiosity’s danger) and symbolism (bracelet as stolen truths). Ending lingers but lacks deeper emotional resonance beyond atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (“polite anarchy”), but some ornate prose distracts. Avoids clichés but occasionally leans on generic descriptors (e.g., “thick air”)</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive with a deliberate word count, but themes (curiosity’s cost) feel surface-level. The ending provokes thought but lacks narrative closure.</comment>
