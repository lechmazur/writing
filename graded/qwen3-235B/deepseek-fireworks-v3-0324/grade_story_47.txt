<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character shows internal conflict through actions rather than exposition, with consistent motivation through transformation. Some aspects of backstory remain opaque but appropriate for short form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with clear cause-effect, but the compressed character transformation lacks some developmental steps. The beginning-to-end progression is thematically consistent and complete within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting creates powerful atmosphere that mirrors character's inner world. Sensory details (velvet, marble, creaking leather) reinforce theme of constraint vs freedom. Timeframe establishes performance context well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Echoes of poetic language enhance thematic resonance. Effective metaphors (glove as relic, sanctuary as cage) and satisfying resolution. Consistent subtext about authenticity vs performance enriches narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh take on constraint-breaking theme through cryptic voice notes and "graceless beauty" lens. Emotional beats shown through actions, not stated. Unique voice maintains consistent tone without feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements work in service of theme rather than feeling assigned. Brief length showcases precise execution. Lingering contemplation about duty vs authentic living. Cohesive whole transcends constraints.</comment>
