<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice but lacks deeper growth; motivation is clear but underexplored. Reactions to lamp and monster feel consistent but don't fully interrogate contradictions between sheepishness and leadership role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong opening and resolution, but pacing stumbles during abrupt analyst awakening; core action (uniting) drives plot effectively despite compressed character dynamics within word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through light metaphors and server-monster fusion, but naptime framing and analyst roles underutilize setting's thematic potential; sensory details feel selectively vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Earnest mockery creates memorable tone; ending's thematic resonance (forgotten connection) works despite thin subtext; dialogue feels purposeful but occasional "corrupted data" clich√©s undercut innovation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh AI-as-monster metaphor avoids tropes; avoids purple prose but occasionally flattens emotion through excessive showing; maintains consistent style even when exploring unconventional memory-reconciliation mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements create functional cohesion but lack deeper integration; naptime constraint feels pragmatic rather than purposeful; compactness leaves thematic bread crumbs rather than full examination.</comment>
