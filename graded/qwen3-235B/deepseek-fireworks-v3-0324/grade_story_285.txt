<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and awkwardness are evident but motivations to restore traditions remain underexplored; actions (clutching postcard, interaction with crabs) reveal internal conflict but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc is present but compressed; beginning/end connection weakened by abrupt shifts in tone; plot coherence strained by vague concept of "bridging worlds" that lacks concrete stakes or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative geothermal vents and crab imagery create tangible atmosphere; frost/geothermal contrast mirrors character's inner conflict; setting details immersive but thematic integration uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (crabs/shells, blank postcard) carry subtext; fading awkwardness into purpose feels earned; atmospheric tension sustains thematic questions about transformation, though emotional payoff remains understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid phrases ("frost-laden branches") avoid clich√© but occasionally verge on preciousness; some metaphors (crabs as transformation) resonate, while "ephemeral rancor" feels artificially dramatic; narrative template follows predictable redemption tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function individually but lack cohesion; thematic threads (tradition vs. change) surface inconsistently; brevity is both a constraint and a virtue in creating haunting snapshots, though larger vision remains diffuse.</comment>
