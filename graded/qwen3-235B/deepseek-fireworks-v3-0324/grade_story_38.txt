<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct personality beyond abstract existential angst; motivations shift between self-discovery and passive reaction. Drunken confessions feel incongruent with established introverted demeanor. Internal voice remains generic, more thematic vessel than lived-in persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot builds from disquiet to epiphany but stumbles over uneven pacing—subway motif and after-party interlude disrupt momentum. Resolution feels abrupt, with thematic throughline between "elimination" and non-violence requiring more nuanced dramatization rather than declarative conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (crumbling orchid, damp paper) effectively evoke claustrophobic decay. However, subway intervals remain underutilized as temporal framework. The "haunted" conceit works atmospherically but lacks concrete integration with protagonist's psychological landscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (whispers as emotional rot, silence as violence) provide intellectual heft. Subtext about confronting neglect resonates, but emotional beats sometimes stated rather than embodied. Ending achieves thematic closure while leaving narrative tension appropriately ambiguous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through philosophical reframing of "haunting," though "attic as psyche" metaphor borders on familiar. Lyricism occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction ("warnings in whispers slithering like vines") but maintains voice distinctness. Emotional subtext feels genuinely contemplative rather than algorithmically formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but execution reveals strain under artificial constraints. Certain elements (subway timing, party incident) feel imposed rather than organically integrated. Style elevates material above competence but underlying structure remains visibly scaffolded by prompt requirements.</comment>
