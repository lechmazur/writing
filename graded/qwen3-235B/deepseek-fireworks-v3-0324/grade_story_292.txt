<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gestures toward depth through symbolic object and guilt-ridden motivation, but character remains archetypal; emotional transitions lack visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear arc from hesitation to resolve; pacing efficient yet occasionally hurried in emotional beats. Coherence maintained through recurring motifs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid imagery (lanterns, smoke, chipped mug) creates atmosphere, but worldbuilding leans on derivative "speakeasy" tropes without deeper cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose (stories as bones, maps as redemption) elevates theme; quiet, resonant ending avoids melodrama. Dialogue sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but flirts with genre conventions (haunted raider, redemptive storytelling); fresh enough but not revolutionary in structure or voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Compelling fragments cohere into emotional journey, yet reliance on assigned elements (talent show, speakeasy) occasionally strains narrative authenticity.</comment>
