<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness is present but underexplored; motivations tied to his mother and leadership insecurity resonate, but interactions lack psychological depth. Dialogue feels somewhat archetypal rather than distinctively personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight word limit restricts development, but a clear arc exists from uncertainty to reluctant acceptance. The owl/flower symbolism maintains cohesion, though the central conflict's resolution feels abrupt despite thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory layering (toxic sky's scent, rain's percussion) creates vivid atmosphere. The greenhouse as dying sanctuary perfectly complements melancholy/comfort duality. Rain showers enhance temporal urgency and symbolic cleansing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose creates emotional resonance (blurred photographs mirroring blurred truths). The subtext of performative leadership and ecological collapse lingers. Ending avoids pat resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés through unusual combinations (toxic cheer, fragile devotion), but some phrases ("language of flowers") verge on familiar abstraction. Emotional nuance emerges through gesture rather than pure telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements interlock thematically—if any element were removed, the symbolic web would unravel. The brief scope feels intentional, focusing on existential compression rather than limitation.</comment>
