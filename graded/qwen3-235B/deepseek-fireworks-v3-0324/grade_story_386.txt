<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Characterization is poetic but underdeveloped; their motivations ("quiet defiance," "trustworthy strange") shape the tone more than actions. Dialogue hints at complexity but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is driven by abstract concepts—time, legacy, healing—but coherence suffers from narrative gaps (e.g., how the catapult bridges time). Pacing is deliberate but occasionally halts for stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details ("atomic core’s glow," "creaking limbs" of the catapult) and symbolic settings (lighthouse as eternal witness). Some elements (timeframe "never moves") remain ambiguously tied to plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with metaphor ("stars’ judgment absolute") and lyrical tension between decay and hope. The ending lingers but underexplores the tablecloth’s metaphysical role, weakening thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise but edges toward abstraction-as-substance; avoids overt clichés (e.g., "catapult launching a tablecloth" feels inventive) but occasionally substitutes poetic vagueness for narrative specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Polished execution, but the story prioritizes mood over rigorous character/plot logic. Required elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole, though some (e.g., "stars’ alignment") feel underutilized conceptually.</comment>
