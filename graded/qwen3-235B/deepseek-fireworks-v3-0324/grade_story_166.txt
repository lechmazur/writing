<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "solemnly silly" attribute isn't fully realized in behavior or dialogue; motivation to communicate with animals drives action but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains arc through caretaker's goal but feels compressed; fox's sudden dialogue introduction and departure create narrative friction within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with geothermal streams and ice-fed fruit creates immersive atmosphere; some descriptions verge on overwritten but effectively serve the ghostly tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Impressive imagery ("snowflakes swirling in gentle chaos") and thematic resonance about connection; ending resonates but subtext remains surface-level compared to poetic potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive elements like plastic straw as ritual tool; some similes ("wind chimes tangled in brambles") risk overfamiliarity but mostly succeed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses constraints effectively to explore cyclical transformation; brief length feels purposeful but limits deeper emotional exploration of ghost's existential burden.</comment>
