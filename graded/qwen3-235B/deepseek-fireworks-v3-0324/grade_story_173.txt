<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (reclaiming memory, connection to phantom) are present but underexplored; symbolic consistency exists, but emotional depth and agency feel limited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pacing strains coherence—visionary scenes and plot mechanics (e.g., phantom’s purpose) lack integration. Resolution feels abrupt despite tight framing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (kelp-swathed arches, citrus/spice echo) immerse, but setting’s thematic fusion with multiverse concepts feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (“veins glowing like constellations”) enrich, but emotional resonance is undercut by abstract detachment; theme of memory/legacy lingers faintly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally border on mannerism; while not derivative, the story leans on melancholic nostalgia without fully reinventing its mythic-nostalgic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element cohesion is uneven—phantom hand and maps anchor well, but multiverse and “kitchen wisdom” feel peripherally used. Lacks transcendent synthesis.</comment>
