<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond assigned calmness; motivation to "spin prophecy" lacks internal conflict or emotional weight. Actions reveal little nuance, relying on stoic archetype without deeper humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function efficiently but lack narrative surprise or emotional stakes. Clear cause/effect between elements, yet feels perfunctory—arc exists but lacks memorable progression within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through sensory details (whispers, creaking wood), but setting integration uneven. Palatial decay supports tone, yet historical specificity remains underdeveloped beyond aesthetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (butterfly as transformation/prophesy) and lyrical prose elevate impact. Ending lingers thematically but could deepen psychological/emotional engagement beyond poetic surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subverts genre expectations with botanical press/prophecy fusion. Avoids clichés through paradoxical "humorous unease," though occasional ornate phrasing risks veering into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into cohesive whole without feeling rigidly checklist-driven. Brevity enhances mythic quality; the unresolved ending invites contemplation rather than diminishes closure.</comment>
