<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid with symbolic actions, but lacks interiority and psychological depth to fully justify her rebellion's scope. Assigned attribute informs her smirk and defiance but not deeper motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning (DVD discovery) and end (cynicism defeated), but pacing stumbles: the man in the trench coat exchange feels rushed, transformation of the street occurs too abruptly without sufficient cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal grit tone is masterfully achieved through tactile details – ink-stained fingers, confetti settling, bulbs casting distorted shadows. The dying parade and flickering neon create a liminal twilight mood that perfectly complements the "broken things" theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery of light-as-rebellion resonates, with bulb patterns forming crown/key/door symbols. The ending has thematic weight but lacks narrative surprise – transformation feels perfunctory rather than earned through character struggle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasional phrases like "whispers in the static" lean toward trope, but the fusion of analog repair with digital prophecy (DVD + fairy lights) shows innovation. Emotional beats rely too heavily on stated affirmations rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Successfully integrates most elements without making their inclusion obvious, though some feel additive rather than organic. The parade's end framing gives satisfying temporal constraint, but broader anti-cynicism theme lacks philosophical complexity to justify its swift triumph.</grade>
