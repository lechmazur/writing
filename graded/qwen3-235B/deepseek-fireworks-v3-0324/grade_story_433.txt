<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s hardheadedness is evident but his psychological transformation lacks granular nuance; motivation is consistent (broken spirit seeking solace/power) but his introspection feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot arc (temptation to rejection of power) is coherent within the constraint, but the transition from resolve to acceptance hinges on underdeveloped internal conflict; pivotal moments feel slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery and snow motif create a haunting, immersive atmosphere; however, overreliance on "melting" imagery borders on redundancy, diluting the sensory impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "power as storm/erosion") are potent, and the quiet resolution avoids melodrama; the theme of surrender as liberation resonates, though the ending’s simplicity risks oversimplifying the moral complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality weakened by familiar "forfeit soul for power" trope; poetic language occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction ("demure audacity") but mostly avoids cliché through vivid, specific imagery (e.g., "scrap of prophecy between forgotten tomes").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole but lack the daring subversion required for prestige publication; the story’s introspective tone and symbolic precision elevate it above average but fall short of transcendent.</comment>
