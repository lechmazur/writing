<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with Mara's internal conflict effectively conveyed through her actions and dialogue. The "genuinely fake" attribute ties into her role as a disillusioned enforcer, though her transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from tension to rebellion, with cause-effect relationships clear. Pacing is mostly effective, but some shifts (e.g., flower’s sudden power) feel under-explained, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like bioluminescent kelp and the hum of glass create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. The setting enhances the supernatural encounter and thematic contrast between utopia’s facade and oceanic reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact and symbolism (flower as rebellion, utopia as lie) are strong. The ending resonates thematically, but "fear isn’t the enemy" message could be more subtly shown than stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "genuinely fake" history) and layered emotions. The tribal dance reference leans generic, but overall style balances precision and poeticism effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly around Mara’s transformation, with brevity emphasizing urgency. The lingering theme of silencing truth elevates the story beyond its constraints, though a few abrupt choices slightly dilute impact.</comment>
