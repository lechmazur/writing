<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Promises but lacks interiority. Timidity feels externalized rather than emotionally embodied. Growth occurs through symbolic action rather than nuanced decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structural symmetry exists but relies on abstract transitions. Scoreboard's role in plot logic feels half-realized. Resolution's poetic quality sometimes eclipses narrative causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, synesthetic worldbuilding merges mythic and industrial elements masterfully. Temporal liminality (dusk, end-of-era) creates potent atmosphere. Sensory cohesion exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphor density risks abstraction but mostly pays off. Emotional resonance through tactile imagery (mother's hands, fabric textures) works beautifully. Ending avoids maudlinness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original conceits avoid formula. Some phrases ("threads of laughter") border on predictable. Magical realism elements feel earned rather than forced. Language occasionally overelaborate but purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic ecosystem but lack visceral grounding. Conceptual strength outweighs psychological realism. Leaves thematic impression rather than haunting emotional truth.</comment>
