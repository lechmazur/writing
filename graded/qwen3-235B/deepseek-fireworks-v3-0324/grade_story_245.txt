<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's rage and redemption motivation are clear but psychological nuance feels abbreviated in short form; motivation aligns with actions but emotional complexity remains underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc from rage to purpose exists but transitions feel compressed; cause-effect between tea leaves and decision lacks gradual realization; pacing manages concision but sacrifices organic progression</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport rendered through precise sensory details (fractured stars, creaking metal) creates haunting atmosphere; setting meaningfully shapes melancholy and existential stakes</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery of etching tea patterns into metal achieves symbolic resonance; theme of purification through waterfalls feels potent but resolution borders on clich√©; subtextual layers present yet execution occasionally heavy-handed</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unusual objects (chopstick, bitter tea) but tone occasionally lapses into formulaic bleakness; metaphors inventive but some phrasing ("streaks of stars") verges on familiar</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements integrated with creativity (chopstick as weapon/map-carver) but short form strains cohesion; leaves lingering impression of archetypal hero's journey beneath original details</comment>
