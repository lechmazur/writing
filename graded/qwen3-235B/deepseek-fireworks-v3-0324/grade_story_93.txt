<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped emotional depth despite symbolic gestures; protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract rather than viscerally experienced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc with elegant convergence of elements, but thematic revelations border on abrupt; emotional pacing could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail lush but occasionally decorational; setting's biological/mystical duality underutilized in advancing plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphor integration (labyrinths as relational spaces, negative geometry), but some over-reliance on portentous pronouncements weakens subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Refreshingly avoids genre tropes and sentimental resolutions; occasional risk of pretension with sacred geometry mysticism, but mostly transcended.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structural cohesion balanced against ambitious thematic density; brevity sharpens the narrative but blunts emotional resonance.</comment>
