<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Limited depth in internal conflict; motivations shift abruptly. The threadbare washcloth and locket symbolize aspects of motivation but character transitions lack sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear arc but rushed pacing. The abrupt shift to the first dance weakens cause-effect chains, though tight word management achieves basic resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Alien glyphs and void-reflected eyes create atmosphere but disconnected sensory details dilute coherence between setting and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like locket warming offer impact, but overuse of "storm" imagery and explicit emotional telling reduce subtlety. Ending feels purposeful but under-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Combines unique elements (embassy setting) with predictable ones (family heirloom backstory). Some phrases ("calculated dreams") verge on clich√©, and emotional arcs lean on tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements fit but lack integration. Strong symbolic objects compete with underdeveloped themes; compression enhances urgency but sacrifices nuance in character change.</comment>
