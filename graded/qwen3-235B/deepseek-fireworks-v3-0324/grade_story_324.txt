<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (insecurity leading to existential doubt) is mostly coherent but lacks depth in exploring the original vs. duplicate dynamic. Internal conflict is hinted but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a chase-confrontation-scape sequence, but pacing feels rushed. Cause-effect (director’s revelation leading to climax) is logical. The 500-word constraint strains the "empty pedestal" reveal’s significance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dark, claustrophobic atmosphere achieved through sparse but vivid details (“cold light,” “oozing brain”). Timeframe “simmering future” is abstract but enhances tension. Echoes and silence as motifs strengthen the oppressive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (brain as “spilled ink,” footsteps as “chorus of ghosts”) evoke lingering unease. Subtext about identity and purpose resonates, but the ending’s ambiguity risks feeling unresolved rather than profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on “secret lab” and “villainous director” tropes without subverting them. Language is purposeful but occasionally veers into stylized abstraction (“fractured idyll”) lacking nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole (identity as a construct), but brevity limits emotional depth. The ending feels deliberate, leaving questions about the “dreamer’s calling” that suggest but don’t fully realize thematic potential.</comment>
