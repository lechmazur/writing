<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's guilt is present but thinly explored; motivations are clear but lack depth beyond surface-level remorse. Internal conflict is shown but not deeply dissected.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, compact structure with logical progression; the tight word limit is handled well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; the turbine imagery works, but the timeframe's ambiguity weakens spatial-temporal cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story; the dialogue-driven resolution and thematic punchland effectively, though abstraction may alienate some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; the fusion of ancient and modern in the setting is inventive, but "resigned exuberance" and some pen descriptions border on artificial complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively, with the pen and turbines standing out as particularly integral; the brevity serves the narrative but leaves some emotional depth unexplored.</comment>
