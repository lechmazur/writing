<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior conflict is vivid, but motivations could be more deeply explored; transformation feels somewhat abrupt despite symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within constraints, but the dream sequence’s transition and spacetime mechanics lack nuanced cause-and-effect integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrast between mechanical sanctuary and island; atmosphere is evocative but occasionally undercut by abstractions like “spacetime.”</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotional impact and symbolic depth are strong; metaphors (paddle as key) and subtext (joy as reclaimable) elevate the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original integration of elements; avoids most clichés, though “dangerously friendly” leans on surface tone rather than deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, though some elements (e.g., spacetime) feel perfunctory; leaves a lingering, purposeful impression.</comment>
