<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters show surface depth; Vael’s internal conflict and Lila’s curiosity are hinted at but lack nuanced development. Dialogue serves plot but feels slightly underexplored for full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc with clear progression, but pacing occasionally feels rushed. The thread between tile, music, and fear-breaking is logical, though the brevity leaves some transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of steam, stone, and music creates immersive atmosphere. Tone contrasts loneliness and connection, though organ’s symbolic resonance could be tightened.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (music as lost knowledge, tile as unity) and poignant ending enhance thematic impact. Central conflict resolves emotionally, though some subtext feels slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi, history, and music with freshness; avoids clichés but leans on familiar redemption arcs. Language is purposeful but occasionally over-ornate (e.g., “crucible of lost knowledge”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements serve narrative cohesion. Creatively combines disparate concepts but sacrifices deeper exploration. Ending lingers thematically, though brevity slightly limits character depth.</comment>
