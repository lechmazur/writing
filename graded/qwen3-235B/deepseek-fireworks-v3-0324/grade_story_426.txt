<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (preservation of folk medicine) is clear but inconsistently tied to actions (hacking playlists, teapot's role). Inner conflict of "angrily peaceful" is hinted but underdeveloped. Emotional shift during the hug lacks sufficient buildup. Voice lacks distinctness in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hacking playlists drives resolution but feels arbitrary; cause-effect between music and ghosts is unconvincing. Marathon training framework provides structure but creates rushed progression. Plot concludes with symbolic resonance but lacks narrative gravity. Pacing favors atmosphere over momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park is vividly sketched (rust, static-like ghosts) but underutilized beyond surface spookiness. Sensory details (bitter brew, creaking tracks) immerse effectively. Atmosphere supports melancholy but tonal shifts (alof passion, anger-to-peace) lack coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sucessfully evokes melancholic wonder through symbolism (teapot, fading ghosts). Subtext of memory/preservation resonates thematically. Ending is poignant but risks sentimentality. Shows over tells in places but some emotional beats (e.g., "storm barely contained") remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (folk medicine preservation is unique) but struggles with execution (playlist hacking feels gimmicky, "storm beneath calm" is overused). Writing straddles poetic and purple prose. Nuanced emotion present (yearning hug) but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive, thematically rich narrative but hinge on implausible components (music's effect on ghosts). Brief length highlights structural gaps but amplifies poetic symbolism. Ends on a resonant note but lacks narrative urgency. Conceptual ambition outweighs technical execution.</comment>
