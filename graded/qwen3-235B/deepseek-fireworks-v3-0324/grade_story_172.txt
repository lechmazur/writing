<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks nuanced emotional depth; motivation to outrun prophecy feels abstract but aligns with his fearful introversion and eventual redemption through architectural obsession. His sharp gentleness is underexplored in actions/dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc from flight to acceptance, but pacing leans on symbolic shorthand; the pivot from "reversed wishes" to alignment is abrupt, weakening cause-effect clarity within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (shimmering seashell walls, humming air), but the seashell’s symbolic connection to architectural blueprints feels forced; sensory details overwhelm cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., prophecy as revelation) and cyclical structure (last photo to horizon walk) provoke thought; ending slightly sentimentalizes "weight of knowing," diluting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with surreal architectural dreams, but phrases like "architecture of the sky" verge on cliché; subversion of prophecy-as-misunderstanding feels fresh, though tone occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements like the puzzle box and seashell are tightly woven, but the hallway photo’s narrative payoff is minimal; the theme of alignment resonates, though execution feels more poetic than structurally precise.</comment>
