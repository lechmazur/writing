<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Presents a moody protagonist through atmospheric gestures, but lacks concrete motivations beyond vague longing; actions feel plot-driven rather than deeply internalized despite poetic metaphors tying object to character psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Linear journey structure carries momentum through symbolic object retrieval, but compressed arc feels truncated; connections between wallet discovery and light reclaiming rely on poetic logic over narrative causality, weakening emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually rich textures dominate - peeling carnival structures, humming machinery, skeletal Ferris wheel create immersive decay; sound design (drone/static/laughter) deepens uncanny atmosphere; occasionally veers into over-familiar gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evokes melancholic wonder through tactile metaphors ("whispering debts," "light warm as a long-ago summer"); ending's quiet transformation avoids melodrama but sacrifices deeper thematic interrogation; tension between time/light remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends noir sensibilities with metaphysical mystery through precise economy; some phrases ("skeletal hand reaching for sky") risk cliche; emotional authenticity emerges in subtle gestures (trembling fingers, empty pocket) rather than stated introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>All elements interlock through thematic resonance rather than mechanical inclusion; brevity serves mystical atmosphere but constrains character depth; final image of quiet redemption creates lingering contemplation about impermanence and renewal.</comment>
