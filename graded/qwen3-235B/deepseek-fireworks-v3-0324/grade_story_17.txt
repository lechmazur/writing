<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are clear but underexplored; his actions align with his past but lack visceral emotional complexity that would make his redemption feel earned rather than merely stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from recklessness to confrontation with guilt, but the resolution feels abrupt despite the word limit; the bowl’s symbolic resistance to breaking lacks sufficient buildup to land fully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting delivers rich sensory details (e.g., “spectral fingers,” “burning herbs”), but the witch’s chamber feels more decorative than integral—its history isn’t woven tightly enough into the protagonist’s internal arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (fractured bowl = fractured self) elevate the story; the ending’s thematic shift—forgiveness as a process—is poignant, though the final line risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (haunted object, witch’s curse); prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten (“whispers of old curses,” “rain on dry earth”), diluting its starkness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coheres around guilt and renewal but struggles to fully integrate all elements—e.g., “brazen modesty” and “zoom” feel stapled on rather than organic. The ending lingers, but some forced touches undermine its power.</comment>
