<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is consistent but underdeveloped; the late-blooming hero’s internal journey lacks sufficient nuance to fully justify the transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on abrupt shifts (e.g., child’s fall) that feel imposed rather than organically earned within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic setting is vivid but inconsistently rendered; some sensory details (e.g., warm brass spyglass) anchor the atmosphere, while others feel generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractured lens mirroring cosmic cracks) and theme of loss-as-lens are evocative, but emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by abstract generalities.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visionary concepts distinguish the narrative, but sporadic reliance on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes (e.g., rooftop farm as resilience) dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under word constraints; the story’s brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, with thematic depth sacrificed for density.</comment>
