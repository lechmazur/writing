<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "honestly dishonest" trait and caretaker role are consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations stated more than demonstrated through lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tight structure aligns with word limit but sacrifices cause-effect clarity; bat-assisted plot mechanics feel poetic rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate abstractions; some connections between elements feel inferred rather than engineered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenly; worldbuilding overshadows character interiority, creating conceptual rather than emotional cohesion.</comment>
