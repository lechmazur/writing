<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; merchant’s internal conflict lacks nuance despite his symbolic actions. The butter churn defines him more than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is visually driven but structurally predictable; the ascent feels more like a linear sequence of obstacles than an organic narrative arc. Some rushed transitions between pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (e.g., crumbling paper, artificial silence), though the artificial cosmos feels underexplored compared to the lush final setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance between rebellion and ecological truth; symbols (churn, tree) carry emotional weight. Ending’s shift from aloofness to warmth feels abrupt but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages risk purple prose (“branches thick, gnarled, and alive”), and the “grand illusion” trope leans on familiar dystopia-escapism narratives without subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate conceptually but not organically; the story’s brevity favors poetic juxtaposition over deep cohesion. Lingering questions about the station’s purpose dilute thematic focus.</comment>
