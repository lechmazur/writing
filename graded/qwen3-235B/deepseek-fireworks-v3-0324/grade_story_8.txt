<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but thinly explored; internal consistency exists but lacks depth in showing how Alistair's nobility or "dazed" nature meaningfully shapes his choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning/end but feels compressed; the chalked messages as the central action drive the narrative, yet the scholar's sudden appearance disrupts pacing and coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting with resonant sensory details (whispering hedges, singing fountains), though the composer’s garden’s thematic ties to music/logic are underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., cosmic dance, chalk as rebellion) and lyrical prose, but relies on abstraction over concrete emotional/subtextual depth, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original premise but occasionally veers into stylized excess; metaphors feel fresh yet risk overshadowing character nuance, with uneven emotional showing vs. telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition is clear, but execution leaves themes diffuse; elements often serve poetic imagery over narrative cohesion, weakening memorability.</comment>
