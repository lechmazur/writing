<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's introspection lacks depth; motivation feels hinted at rather than fully realized. The "hunger beneath" duty remains vaguely sketched despite vivid atmospheric cues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses through atmospheric details more than action. The bee encounter resolves the grace-seeking premise, but cause/effect between twist tie, code, and outcome remain under-explained for full narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory layering (rotting stone, fractured light, metallic twist tie) creates haunting physicality. Oil change timeframe only weakly integrates with cathedral's timelessness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery elevates the mystical quest but lacks emotional weight. Subtext about lost languages/resurrection feels implied rather than earned through character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept (twist-tie bee code) but occasionally veers into abstract vagueness ("uncharted echoes"). Avoids clichés but sometimes replaces them with imprecise metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong standalone atmosphere, but assigned elements unevenly prioritize execution—some (twist tie/bee language) deeply integrated, others (oil changes timeframe) barely functional within logic.</comment>
