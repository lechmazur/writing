<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's duality of arrogance and self-doubt is vividly sketched through symbolic interactions with tapestry/song, though the rapid internal transformation lacks nuanced progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant arc from pride to humility realized within constraints; the pivotal interaction with the master drives plot efficiently, though the connection between "authorizing" and the protagonist's legend could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonlit courtyard saturated with ink-fragrance and resonant song creates a spiritually charged atmosphere; the integration of the tapestry’s tactile symbolism with sensory details is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (blade as chain/key, tapestry as soul) resonate deeply; the ending’s symbolic shift from sword-strike to reflection achieves poetic closure while emphasizing the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense imagery occasionally borders on overwrought ("harsh tenderness"), but the blending of martial and artistic motifs avoids cliché; emotional subtext emerges through visceral, non-literalized details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly—each detail (e.g., wedding song disrupting warrior ethos) serves dual purposes in character growth and thematic resonance; brevity amplifies impact rather than constraining it.</comment>
