<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "streetwise" and "orphan" aren't meaningfully integrated into her decisions or voice beyond surface-level descriptions. Motivation is clear, but lacks emotional depth or evolution that reflects her background.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but the compressed word count creates rushed transitions (e.g., sudden world inversion). The "theoretically random" obstacles lack narrative weight, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere created through vivid sensory contrasts (glowing vines/rot, whispers/laughter), but the "unwritten calendar" concept feels underexploited and vague. Setting doesn't fully deepen the thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clever use of symbolism (reversed patterns = self-fulfilling curse) and resonant final line. Ending message feels somewhat familiar despite strong imagery; subtext about trauma/redemption lacks gut-punch precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s in premise (brooch-as-metaphor-for-identity), but contains AI-writing telltales: overpolished sentences, emotionally flat transitions ("Instead, the world inverted..."), and occasional generic descriptors ("chaotic hum").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent execution of high-concept fantasy, but lacks the psychological complexity or stylistic daring needed to transcend genre conventions. The "unwritten calendar" and "harvest hope" elements feel conceptually stronger than their implementation.</comment>
