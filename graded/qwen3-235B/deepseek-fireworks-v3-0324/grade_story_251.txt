<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's mix of ambivalence and motivation exists but lacks depth. Moments of "bashful arrogance" and "happily sad" surface briefly but feel decorative rather than foundational. Actions align with assigned traits but lack psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works against coherency in constrained space. Pacing alternates between lyrical stasis and abrupt shifts, leaving plot progression feeling disjointed. The central action's cosmic implications lack concrete narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Potent lunar colony imagery diluted by underdeveloped timeframe of "between heartbeats." Sensory details like humming machinery and fragmented light create texture, but the setting remains spatially ambiguous. Object-setting relationship feels incidental rather than symbiotic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("time is a jigsaw") resonate poetically. Ending's ambiguity lingers, but emotional impact relies too heavily on atmospheric vagueness. The theme of rewriting fate emerges through imagery more effectively than through character or plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Occasionally lapses into overwrought phrases ("veins of possibility bleeding into gaps"). Fresh combinations (gritty colony + cosmic metaphysics) offer originality, but structure follows familiar mythic redemption tropes. Motivations remain abstract rather than humanely nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't fully fuse. Lunar setting feels transportable, marbles function primarily as symbolic MacGuffins. Creates atmospheric intrigue but lacks urgent thematic core or narrative urgency that would justify its existence in the tight word limit.</comment>
