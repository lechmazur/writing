<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character’s traits and archivist role are consistent with actions, but emotional depth remains limited; motivation drives plot but lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight pacing with clear arc, but transitions between elements (e.g., lanterns, holograms) occasionally prioritize poetry over cause-effect clarity; concept shapes plot but strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers, but the Sumerian palace’s reimagined grandeur feels underexplored and inconsistently tied to thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor and cyclical structure; themes of memory/legacy are potent but slightly diluted by abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clichés; avoids AI stereotypes; metaphors (e.g., “shouting silence”) are fresh, though some phrasing borders on ornate; emotional subtext is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively, but uneven emphasis on setting (Sumerian palace) and timeframe slightly undermine thematic impact; lingering melancholy suggests depth.</comment>
