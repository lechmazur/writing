<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has emotional resonances but lacks concrete history to fully ground motivations; reactions are introspective but occasionally abstract rather than viscerally demonstrated through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moments of lyrical cohesion disrupted by abrupt transitions; the arc from self-erasure to resolve is implied but underdeveloped. Pacing leans overly static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is a visceral extension of character psychology—scorched labs, ozone, shadows all reflect internal decay and flickering hope with exceptional atmospheric clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ticket stubs as memory fragments, faltering drone as mortality) is evocative, but emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on brooding adjectives rather than stark, resonant imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally succumbs to ornate phrasing ("hollow recklessness") and conceptual vagueness that suggests algorithmic flourishes over human specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting vignette, but the story leans on aesthetic beauty more than structural innovation or thematic boldness required to transcend its word limit constraints.</comment>
