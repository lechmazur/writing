<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (belonging/worth) is clear, but internalization feels generalized; the phantasmal ticket's interaction reveals depth, but the voice lacks idiosyncratic specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tight structure with strong throughline (ticket as catalyst); pacing falters slightly during carnival shifts, but cyclical time motif ties beginning/ending cohesively despite magical logic gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually arresting; rust/sawdust, moth-eaten costumes, frozen clock create immersive liminality. "Near distance" tone unevenly applied, but carnival's uncanny textures dominate memorably.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skillful deployment of metaphor (mirror-as-reflection, carnival-as-mindscapes). Subtext on artistry/loneliness resonates; resolution avoids trite catharsis for nuanced ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s via surreal fusion of board game logic and carnival uncanny; minimal "purple prose," though "heartbeat ticket" edges on familiar magical object trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>All elements serve theme without feeling contrived; brevity amplifies emotional economy; lingering questions about carnival origin remain intentional, not accidental.</comment>
