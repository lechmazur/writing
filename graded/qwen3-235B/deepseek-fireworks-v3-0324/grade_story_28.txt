<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity beyond surface traits; motivation implied but not fully explored; "slyness" unconnected to actions; family tradition mentioned then abandoned; minimal character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by word limit; key elements introduced without sufficient setup (fork's significance); resolution feels abrupt despite logical cause-effect chain; pacing uneven between atmospheric linger and sudden discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid setting with specific sensory details creating palpable decay; carnival atmosphere perfectly mirrors thematic tension between joyous past and present desolation; connection between tarnished fork and environment strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical layering (preservation vs decay); skillful showing rather than telling; theme of cultural impermanence resonant; emotional arc truncated by length constraints; ending bittersweet but slightly pat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; carnival decay trope given specific texture through unique details; some phrases border on poetic (e.g., "sigh of wind with cotton candy scent"); emotional restraint maintains authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Successful integration of core elements (carnival, fork, folklore) but forced aspects remain; certain components (family tradition) feel extrinsically imposed; length limitation both strength and weakness; memorable images outweigh structural compression.</comment>
