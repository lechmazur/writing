<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (preserving old ways) are clear but underdeveloped; the jaded locksmith's traits inform his actions, but deeper psychological complexity and nuance are lacking. Dialogue reveals character but lacks distinctiveness in first-person/limited perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The throne-centric plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; the encounter method creates tension yet lacks logical cause-effect progression from entering the orchard to confrontation. Pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard and colonial rooftops create vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (paint, clay, fruit) immerse effectively, though timeframe connection to "painting" remains underutilized beyond brief atmospheric reference.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story uses symbolism (throne = legacy) and conflict well, with subtext about preservation vs. obsolescence. Dialogue sharpens tension but occasionally veers into contrived exchanges. Thematic coherence strong though emotional impact uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unique setting elements avoid clich√©s, but some descriptions verge on ornate ("calloused from years of turning tumblers"). Subtlety in character psychology missing; metaphors effective but not revelatory. Predictable tropes (lone challenger claiming throne) undercut originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically (throne as preservation symbol) but some feel formulaic (guardian trope). Style has moments of strength but uneven balance between lyrical prose and narrative clarity. Leaves thought, lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
