<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has some conflicting traits (strength vs. delicacy, violence vs. healing) but remains underdeveloped. Gracefully awkward attribute is superficially mentioned without meaningful exploration. Motivation (healing traditions) feels tacked on rather than organically tied to his lumberjack persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compact structure effectively connects beginning (discovery of letter) to end (intended confrontation). The coded letter drives plot progression efficiently, though the transition from passive observer to active agent feels slightly rushed. Maintains momentum within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully rendered - the ossuary/restaurant juxtaposition creates cognitive dissonance that enhances thematic tension. Sensory details (polished bones, scent of meat/bones, candlelit symbols) create vivid atmosphere that enhances both horror and emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story successfully uses symbolic contrasts (healing/destruction, past/future) that persist beyond surface narrative. Ending resonates thematically while maintaining momentum. Some overwrought metaphors ("symbols bleeding through paper like ghosts") undercut otherwise potent imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by familiar tropes (conspiratorial restaurateur, chosen one protagonist). Some fresh juxtapositions but relies on generic descriptors ("shadowy figures") and occasionally clich√©d phrasing. Emotional subtlety often buried beneath surface-level explanations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion despite multiple assigned elements. Shows ingenuity in combining ossuary and gourmet dining for thematic contrast, though lumberjack character feels arbitrarily assigned rather than essential to the narrative framework.</comment>
