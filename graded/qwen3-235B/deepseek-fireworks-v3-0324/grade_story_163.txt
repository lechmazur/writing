<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks depth in heiress’ backstory or personal stakes; motivation is clear but insufficiently anchored in her identity as a “lost” heir. Her bitter optimism is hinted through actions but underexplored beyond gritting teeth and quips.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently, but the “detour” feels contrived and unnecessary. Cause/effect between the parking stub and reality unification is logical, though the ending’s deus ex machina crack weakens closure. Pacing is tight but occasionally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Xenobiology station and alien flora create a vivid, disorienting atmosphere. Cloud migration and “bitter optimism” tone are evocative, though the setting’s connection to the heiress’ personal history could be deeper. Sensory details are specific and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling succeeds through metaphors (e.g., stub as “key” to a fractured world) and the lingering crack in the dome. Subtext about temporary solutions resonates, but the heiress’ internal conflict lacks the nuanced “showing” required for top-tier emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but “fragmented reality” is familiar. The parking stub’s use is inventive, and the ending twist subverts expectations. Some phrases (“reckless precision”) feel forced, and the sci-fi elements occasionally lean on generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements like the stub and fragmented reality are well-integrated, but the detour and xenobiology station feel arbitrary. The theme of impermanence emerges strongly, though the tight word count leaves some setups unresolved.</comment>
