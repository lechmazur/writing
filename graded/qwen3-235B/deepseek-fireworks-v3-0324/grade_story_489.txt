<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Unseen observer lacks distinct personality beyond assigned traits; motivations implied but not dramatized; abstract entity's actions remain symbolic rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but whale/dancer connection introduced too abruptly; cohesion maintained through resonant imagery despite temporal compression challenges.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse atmosphere evocative but disjointed from dancer's theatrical setting; sensory details (lantern flicker, whale's sonic force) immersive but unevenly applied between locations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical weaving of time/loss/revival profoundly resonant; ending's mythic quality transcends narrative abstractions; tension between impermanence and continuity hauntingly conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through surreal combination of elements, but whale-song personification and "sinking offering" risk borderline sentimentalism; overall style purposeful with minimal purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Successful atmospheric unification undermined by tenuous dancer-whale connection; elements mostly well-deployed but occasional sense of checklist-driven construction; thematic payoff justifies structural constraints.</comment>
