<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; Mara's profession lacks narrative integration, Eli's prejudice is stated but not demonstrated. Dialogue feels contrived rather than revealing organic connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague symbolism rather than coherent cause-effect. The ending transformation feels unearned despite atmospheric buildup. Pacing lingers on sensory details while under-resolving narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich but dissonant imagery: spaceport decay and farmerâ€™s market sweetness clash tonally rather than complement. Sensory details evoke mood more effectively than setting-function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (decaying relic = transformation) work better than underexplored subtext about human connection. Ending aims for mythic resonance but sacrifices thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes in setting but relies on mystical object trope. Nuanced details (frayed sleeves, tarnished punch) contrast with schematic emotions ("tension in shoulders"). Voice occasionally veers into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element overload weakens cohesion; strengths (sensory writing) undermined by structural ambiguity. Attempts thematic depth but requires reader extrapolation to fill narrative gaps.</comment>
