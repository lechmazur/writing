<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Psychological complexity in conflict between obsessive control and existential surrender is compelling, but character voice occasionally slips into abstract rumination at the expense of concrete personal history that would deepen motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Non-linear time focus and internal climax are ambitious but risk diffusing narrative drive; symbolic progression from ink blotter to constellations provides structural coherence despite minimal external action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid tactile descriptions (brass coldness, crumbling architecture) masterfully evoke spiritual disorientation, but "ancient Indian temple" lacks culturally specific details that could have amplified metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphor density (constellations as fragmented truth, ink blotter as obsolete order) creates profound resonance; ending's philosophical payoff feels earned through precise symbolic through-lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids apocalypse clich√©s by focusing inward, though some phrases ('whispered secrets,' 'shuddering breath') risk poetic formulaic tendencies; conceptual originality elevates overall execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize thematically but occasionally strain credibility through sheer density of symbolism; brevity serves psychological focus while sacrificing opportunity for deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
