<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; traits like "rebel" and "adaptation" are stated but not demonstrated through distinct, nuanced actions. Dialogue lacks differentiation to fully establish voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear progression but compressed; the call driving action feels abrupt. The meeting with Lena resolves too quickly, undermining tension. Cause/effect (adaptation, pocket knife) underexplored in shaping arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Ephemeral gloom and haunted house evoke atmosphere but rely on generic details (peeling paint, dust). Sensory elements like "old popcorn" lack specificity. Tone clashes with the fiery mapo tofu simile, weakening cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "smile a flicker" and "mapo tofu burn" are vivid but overreliance on food similes feels forced. Theme of adaptation is present but unevenly layered. Ending’s thematic resonance is diluted by sentimentalized closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (cuisine as emotional connection) but clichéd haunt tropes and "underrated rebel" archetype undercut originality. Purple prose tendencies ("poetry of survival") and sentimental dialogue undermine authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements are loosely integrated; the cuisine and adaptation concepts feel tacked on rather than organic. The concise format works thematically but sacrifices depth in character and plot. Lingering impression is vague, not profound.</comment>
