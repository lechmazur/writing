<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's emotional conflict is clear, but motivations are inferred rather than deeply explored; the logically emotional attribute manifests superficially without psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through action but feels compressed; overreach as catalyst works, but cause-effect logic between scent and decisions lacks development within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details and the whispering gallery's acoustics masterfully immerse; atmosphere amplifies tension better than other elements resolve cohesively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (key as redemption) and imagery (serpent-spine tunnels) elevate impact; ending conflates thematic depth with rushed resolution but leaves lingering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Verses purple prose adeptly but relies on "garden at night" clich√©; some metaphorical freshness (e.g., "whispers sharpening into hiss") countered by predictable tonal shifts and AI-like emotional abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indispensable; pacing and brevity work against thematic density despite elegant prose, falling short of transcendent literary execution.</comment>
