<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Confrontation drives plot effectively; secret revelation creates arc but feels abrupt; pacing balanced until abrupt sock-surrender finale; cause-effect between confession and structural collapse is metaphorical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie lighthouse atmosphere vividly rendered; "equilibria" concept visually/tonally consistent; sock and rusted machinery contrast abstraction with grit; applause/silence extremes create sonic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Philosophical tropes get twist through machinery metaphors; some phrases ("echoes in lighthouse") feel clich√©d; emotional subtext exists but occasionally slips into abstraction; avoids AI-ness but not fully "human" in psychological nuance.</comment>
