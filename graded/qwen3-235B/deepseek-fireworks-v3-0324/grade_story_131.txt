<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is consistent but thinly sketched; motivation to transform fear into courage lacks psychological depth, though the stones' symbolism aligns with their arc. Voice lacks distinctiveness, weakening emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is discernible but underdeveloped: the anomaly’s resolution feels abrupt, and the method (stones as anchors) lacks explanation. Pacing juggles key moments but sacrifices coherence; the connection between the lottery ticket and the anomaly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly’s distortion creates eerie atmosphere through shimmering air and groaning walls, but sensory details are uneven. The garage’s claustrophobia contrasts with the town’s distortion, though the setting’s full potential remains untapped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Relies heavily on stated themes (“adapt or perish”) rather than subtext; some effective imagery (e.g., stones reflecting a calmed sky) but lacks nuance. Ending feels slightly pat, and emotional resonance is diluted by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is diluted by genre tropes (orphan protagonist, cataclysmic anomaly) and predictable metaphors (“anchors for a world straining to hold itself together”). Writing avoids purple prose but occasionally flattens emotion (e.g., “courage wasn’t the absence of fear”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are technically integrated but often perfunctorily: the gravitational anomaly feels more like a backdrop than a narrative engine, and the stones’ significance lacks mythic or scientific grounding. The brevity constrains deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
