<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While Elias is sympathetically gruff and shows some emotional arc, his "lovable grumpiness" remains superficial with minimal psychological nuance; motivations shift abruptly without deep exploration of conflicting emotions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from desperation to transformation but feels compressed; pivotal actions (drinking polluted water) lack necessary justification or weight within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually effective with muck, oil-slicked pools, and monks' stained robes; some underutilized atmospheric potentials in carnival-packing dawn context and tactile interactions with the swamp.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolic undertones (beetle awakening, water as transformation) create resonance, but emotional payoff remains surface-level; theme of "becoming" isn't fully developed beyond action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clockwork beetle and "water wisdom" concept show ingenuity but verge on magical-thinking tropes; some predictable structure with underdeveloped subtext; language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere reasonably but without distinctive breakthrough; concise format serves mythical undertones but sacrifices thematic complexity; closing smile feels premature to justify "accidental mayor" revelation.</comment>
