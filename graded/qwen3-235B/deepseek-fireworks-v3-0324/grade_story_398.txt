<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Weakly defined motivation beyond abstract idealism; underdeveloped backstory limits emotional depth despite symbolic actions with calendar and tapestry.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent but rushed arc; thematic resolution feels abrupt, though cause-effect chain between dream and cynicism mitigation maintains structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory metaphors in sanctuary description (yarn-as-chaos, glowing tapestry) effectively immerse reader, but time-frame's "between waves" remains underutilized atmospheric element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (ash-to-hope, woven threads as connection) and lyrical prose create emotional undercurrents; ending suggests thematic openness with lingering potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through yarn-centric metaphors but retains trace AI-esque phrasing ("frost in sunlight"); emotional beats shown through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements serve story cohesion through motif reinforcement (broken calendar → mending theme), though brevity prevents full exploration of concept interplay.</comment>
