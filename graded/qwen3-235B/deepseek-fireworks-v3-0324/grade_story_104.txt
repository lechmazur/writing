<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Steward's stoicism is consistent, motivations tied to defiance of conformity are clear, and character voice aligns with actions. However, some inner conflicts and backstory nuances could be more fully fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from setup to resolution, with cause-effect well-maintained. Slight rushed feel in final transition through the door, but structure remains cohesive and purposeful within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocativeâ€”cynical warmth, decay, and fragile perfection create immersive setting. Sensory details (cider, peeling skies, humming cameo) deeply enhance mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism, thematic resonance (truth in imperfection), and subtext elevate impact. Ending balances hope with lingering mystery. Prose is precise, avoiding over-explanation while maintaining emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality in blending museum realism with surreal elements (upside-down trees, sentient sparrow) avoids formulaic tropes. Language is purposeful, never flowery; emotional subtext is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into narrative logic; length serves mystery rather than hinders. Story prompts reflection on truth and conformity. Slight pacing imbalance in climax slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
