<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (mapping ghost towns) is clear but lacks emotional depth; "reckless" and "meticulously careless" traits are superficially shown. The core shift from denial to acceptance is implied but underdeveloped. Dialogue with the musician reveals vulnerability but feels transactional rather than transformative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to constraint but sacrifices pacing: the revelation occurs too abruptly. Cause-effect between the musician’s dialogue and the hunter’s epiphany feels under-scaffolded. The circular structure (mist at both ends) works, but the word limit strains the emotional payoff of the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive (sensory details like "brittle leaves," "eerie shadows" excel), and the mist-heavy setting mirrors the theme of obscured memories. However, the abandoned funfair’s symbolic potential (decaying joy vs. hunter’s recklessness) remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dialogue-as-revelation device is effective. The metaphor of "ghosts as unkept promises" elevates the narrative thematically. Ending avoids sentimentality by anchoring change in tactile detail (weight of the lens). However, internal conflict is somewhat simplified into a binary shift (reckless → reflective).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés (e.g., "funfair ghosts" subverted by focusing on psychological resonance). Language is vivid but occasionally overwritten ("weight of recklessness atomize"). Emotional subtext (regret, redemption) is implied through action rather than stated, though the resolution leans on familiar redemption tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story’s tight cohesion (setting → dialogue → revelation → resolution) is its strength. Elements like the lens and musician feel purposeful, not arbitrary. The ending lingers, yet the brevity leaves some thematic threads (e.g., the "forgotten promise") undernourished.</comment>
