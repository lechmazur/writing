<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Guard's loyally disloyal trait and horizon obsession are clear but underexplored. Spoon symbolism hints at past life but lacks concrete narrative grounding. Minimal dialogue weakens voice distinctness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Linear arc exists but feels rushed—gust of wind and leap lack sufficient emotional buildup. Spoon's loss catalyzes action, but plotting prioritizes symbolic beats over psychological plausibility for abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere: cloud-cafe mist and midnight grocery hush create dissonant yet compelling sensory fusion. Typewriter rhythm enhances temporal fluidity, though floating island's societal context remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "frothy despair" and typewriter heartbeat effectively convey existential tension. Theme of horizon-chasing resonates, but emotional impact diluted by overreliance on poetic abstraction over visceral character experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some overwritten imagery ("mist curling like edges of time") borders on self-parody. Original premise for spoon symbolism undercut by sentimental ending. Character reasoning feels archetypal rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but not structurally—the cafe setting and midnight hush contribute mood more than narrative drive. Spoon's centrality works, but typewriter motif feels arbitrarily attached to action.</comment>
