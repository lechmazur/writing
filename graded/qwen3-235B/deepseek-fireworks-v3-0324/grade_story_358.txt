<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is archetypal rather than fully realized; motivations (ambition, sacrifice) are clear but lack psychological nuance. Internal conflict shown through reflections but never transcends symbolic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure follows a dreamlike logic but lacks narrative urgency. The riddle drives progression, yet the playground transformation feels abrupt. Pacing uneven but creates a closed loop between isolation and frontier-seeking.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse is masterfully rendered with visceral details (frost-laden ferns, skeletal swings). The collision of sterile science and mythic dread creates haunting atmosphere that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (coffin fragment as key, frontier as self-erasure) create subtext about legacy vs. consumption. The frozen fox’s question and recursive ending prompt lingering reflection, though emotional beats occasionally veer toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids clichés (pharaoh’s coffin in Arctic) but relies on occasional overwrought phrases ("drum of dread"). Transitions between playground and frontier are jarring. Sensory details vivid but unevenly balanced with narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified exploration of obsession. The ending’s recursive structure rewards contemplation, though the brevity strains the scale of the transformation. Style enhances rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
