<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's apathy and hidden curiosity are well-illustrated through actions and setting, but his internal conflict remains underexplored and lacks nuanced evolution beyond a superficial shift.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and subtle arc via the journey and revelation of "Listen," but the abrupt resolution of the shadow motif and hinted family motivation feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly built through sensory details (bioluminescence, vibrating gills), but the settingâ€™s connection to the family tradition and timeframe feels disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphors (barbed wire shadows, living library) and symbolic elements, but the theme of listening vs. apathy lacks the subtextual depth needed to fully resonate emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original setting and tone subvert tropes, but relies on overused phrases ("whispers of wisdom") and overly abstract imagery that occasionally veers into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion despite multiple elements, but several (family tradition, timeframe) are superficially included, weakening thematic integration and emotional payoff.</comment>
