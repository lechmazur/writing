<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character’s solitary nature and “fiercely gentle” trait shape actions but lack psychological depth; motivation to “leap of faith” is consistent but underexplored beyond surface symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a coherent arc but feels compressed—the transition from discovery to transcendence lacks nuanced buildup, undermining emotional stakes despite logical cause-effect relationships.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in blending cosmic surrealism with artistic yearning, but occasionally veers into abstract vagueness; some phrases risk ornate detachment from emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poetic whole, but the story’s brevity and abstract tone prioritize atmosphere over fully realized thematic depth, leaving room for greater narrative ambition.</comment>
