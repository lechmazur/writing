<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is hinted at but lacks depth in demonstrating how his "lukewarmness" and loyalty peculiarly shape his actions; emotional stakes remain abstract despite symbolic props.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague metaphors ("clash via absence") that strain coherence; while the arc from hesitation to resolve is clear, critical plot logic (e.g., how silhouettes propel action) feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lunar base setting is underutilized; atmosphere relies heavily on poetic descriptors ("charred serenity") but lacks sensory specificity tied to the environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolic motifs elevate craft, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts; ending gains resonance but feels cryptic rather than profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Originality exists in juxtaposing lunar base with domestic relics, but "echoes" and "fog" flirt with cliché; prose borders on ornate without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element cohesion is mixed—doormat and shadows integrate well, but lunar base feels arbitrary; brevity serves poetic tone but sacrifices narrative clarity.</comment>
