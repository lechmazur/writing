<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are atmospheric but lack psychological depth; motivation (faith dilemma) is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced choices. Actions align thematically but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on passive observation (reading ripples) over active progression; concept drives structure but pacing falters during abstract revelations. Connection between ending and beginning feels metaphorically rather than causally earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory immersion is exceptional (metallic potions, spectral barks), with setting and atmosphere inextricably linked to the character’s introspective journey. Dog park’s surrealism enhances tone without feeling forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evasive metaphors (ripples as language) create intellectual resonance, and the ending’s transcendence feels earned. However, emotional impact relies too heavily on explicit descriptors (“exultant grief”) rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ribbon/ripple mechanic but falters with clichéd “faith vs. madness” dichotomy. Language occasionally veers into ornateness (“steam rising like ghostly hounds”) without deepening theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly: the dog park and brewing feel organic, while the ribbon’s symbolic shifts strain believability. Ambition for depth outweighs execution in word-constrained execution.</comment>
