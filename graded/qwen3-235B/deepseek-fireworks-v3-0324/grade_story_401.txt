<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are clear but backstory lacks depth; internal conflict drives action but interactions feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Logical progression from decoding to revelation, though the trigger mechanism feels abrupt; tight word limit strains smooth pacing transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with sensory details (coral, saltwater, bitter coffee) creating haunting underwater atmosphere; contrasts ritual coffee with submerged ruin effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional themes resonate through metaphor-rich action; ending achieves catharsis but surface-tension resolution risks underdevelopment; "equalizing the past" conceptually rich.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but encoded blanket borders on contrived; language maintains purposeful lyricism without excessive ornamentation; emotional nuance shown through specific actions (clutching ring).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel cohesively integrated; brevity serves thematic compression rather than limiting; lingering questions about process vs. redemption suggest layered subtext.</comment>
