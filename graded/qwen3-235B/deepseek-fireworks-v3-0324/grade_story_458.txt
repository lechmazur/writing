<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict shown through tactile interactions with objects, but motivations lack deeper emotional nuance beyond surface-level duty. Protagonist’s decision feels decisive yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Efficient three-act structure within constraints, though the coffee stain omen device feels imposed rather than organically connected to the plot’s philosophical stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through deliberate thematic repetition, though brevity leaves structural seams visible; emotional resonance prioritized over narrative complexity.</comment>
