<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's moral code is hinted at but underdeveloped; motivation persists as a plot device rather than a nuanced drive, with emotional reactions feeling perfunctory despite consistent actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear arc from retrieval to revelation, but pacing stumbles between fragmented clues; cause-effect logic holds, though the ending feels abrupt within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Visually striking but disjointed setting; sensory details (tea, neon) are effective, yet the fusion of ancient Rome and cyberpunk lacks cohesive integration with the plot’s emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clever use of tea steeping and bottle caps as metaphors for revelation; ending sparks reflection on truth and erasure, though emotional depth is unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Blends fresh concepts (ancient/futuristic mashup) with familiar tropes (hacktivist hero); avoids overt clichés but leans on genre conventions without subverting them meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements largely serve the narrative, but the hybrid setting and method occasionally feel contrived; the ending lingers, though the story’s ambition outpaces its execution.</comment>
