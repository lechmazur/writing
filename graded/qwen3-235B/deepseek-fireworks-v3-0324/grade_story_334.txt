<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth undermines the sentinel’s motivations; rapid descent from doubt to destruction feels contrived. Assigned traits are superficially stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesive within constraints but overly reliant on abrupt shifts—technician’s yelp has no narrative consequence, and the fractal collapse lacks logical progression. High-concept ending sacrifices emotional payoff for spectacle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions (auroras, crackling energy) create immersive atmosphere, but the observatory’s function remains decorative. Sensory details hint at deeper systems without fully exploiting their narrative potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“storm of loyalties”) elevate the prose, but emotional resonance is undercut by clichés (“thunder from gods”) and an ending that prioritizes shock over thematic closure. Subtext about agency vs. conformity lacks development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sometimes slips into ornamental excess (“artificially authentic relic”) but avoids egregious formulaic writing. Parallel realities and the sentinel’s arc hint at originality, though reliance on “rebel against mediocrity” tropes weakens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated—the observatory’s scientific purpose remains disconnected from its symbolic role. The brevity works for momentum but sacrifices thematic depth.</comment>
