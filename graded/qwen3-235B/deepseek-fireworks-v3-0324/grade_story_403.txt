<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is emblematic but thinly drawn; motivations are consistent yet lack psychological depth, relying on archetypal resonance over human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a cyclical arc but telescopes transitions (armor shedding, booth’s collapse) in ways that feel rushed; coherence maintained but at expense of nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered with tactile details (sheds of whispering tomes, peeling serpent-paint) but occasionally succumbs to overfamiliar "mythic" tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Uses recursive symbolism effectively (seashell as prison/key) and closes on a thematically satisfying metamorphosis; subtext about perception lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by twisting expectations (miracles as "curse," armor as psychological shell) but occasionally leans on ornate abstraction that feels self-conscious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion thematically but occasionally strain logic (faded booth’s sentience, library’s sentience); transcendent mood compensates structural gaps.</comment>
