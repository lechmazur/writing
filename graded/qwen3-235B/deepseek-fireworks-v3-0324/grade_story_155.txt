<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s profession lacks thematic integration; motivation for wielding power feels underexplored despite gestures toward obsession. Actions are driven more by plot mechanics than nuanced inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive structure with clear beginning (grasping box)/middle (timeline-jumping)/end (closure of box), but pacing leans too episodic; cause/effect of timeline shifts lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative setting contrasts past and present, but sensory details (neon static, generic "thick air") lack precision; atmosphere not fully leveraged to deepen emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery (welding reality, unraveling threads) elevates the story. Ending’s open-ended tension between curiosity and ruin lingers. Subtext about manipulating time resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (buttons as "doors") and subversion of sci-fi tropes avoid formulaic writing. Nuanced tone balances wonder and dread without overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements synergize but lack transformative depth. Concise style works, but story’s brevity amplifies underdeveloped threads (e.g., "inherited mystery"). Prompts questions but doesn’t fully answer.</comment>
