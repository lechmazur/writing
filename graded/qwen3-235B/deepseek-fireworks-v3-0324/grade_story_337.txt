<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack emotional depth; Mira's contradictions are surface-level. Dialogue with Felix reveals dynamics but doesn't deepen inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying rhythm but feels truncated; cause-effect between tile/reclamation and the action is implied, not dramatized. Pacing uneven in key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich visual atmosphere but underutilizes sensory details beyond sight. Setting shapes mood cleverly but doesn't actively drive character decisions or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (mosaics, kinks) elevates the narrative. Ending resonates thematically but relies partially on stated ideas rather than fully shown impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains occasional ornate phrasing ("whispered over teacups"). Subtle emotional nuance missing in character interactions; tone consistent but narrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly successful but uneven - some (studio, oracle method) feel decorative rather than essential. Brief format feels intentional but limits thematic expansion.</comment>
