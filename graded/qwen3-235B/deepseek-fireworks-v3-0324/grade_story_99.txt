<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character’s telekinetic bond with books exists but lacks evolution; “strictly casual” trait mentioned but underdemonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plotted with atmospheric cohesion but strained pacing in flashback transitions; revival goal resolved too abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting’s decaying carnival and ash-filled void vividly evoke melancholy; sensory links between wrapper’s sound and memory fragments amplify unease.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (key shaped from wrapper) and theme (transformation’s cost) resonate, but explicit warnings about knowledge’s price undercut subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains faintly algorithmic phrases (“silence like a blade”); telekinetic bookbinder’s voice lacks idiosyncratic depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under brevity; ending evokes reflection though some threads (timeframe) feel underdeveloped.</comment>
