<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bandit's motivation to master time drives actions, but his transformation from scholar to bandit lacks depth; his "eloquent silence" is hinted but mostly told, not demonstrated through distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable "seeking help" arc; the harp's role in resolving tension is underdeveloped, leaving the ending abrupt. Progression from isolation to partnership lacks pivotal moments to fully justify its emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Refuge is visually vivid but sensory details are uneven; the harp's soundscape adds atmosphere, but the electronic wilderness lacks tactile/smell elements. Timeframe references (classroom) feel tacked on rather than woven into setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (harp as fractured harmony, chip as "confession") add depth; ending conveys theme of connection over control. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, though emotional resonance could be heightened through subtlety rather than direct "realization" statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evasions of clich√©s (scholar-turned-bandit, AI chip) via philosophical focus on fractured time/relationships. Some phrases ("graveyard of forgotten technology") border on familiar; tone maintains cohesion despite abstract concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work in harmony but lack interdependence; the harp and classroom timeframe feel additive rather than organic. Emotional payoff is present, and brevity feels intentional, though certain components (shattered allegiances) remain underexploited.</comment>
