<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coherent arc from searching to epiphany, but pacing feels rushed during the compact's revelation; the power outage framing provides structural cohesion while the coffee sleeve subplot adds narrative weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a contemplative whole but lack narrative urgency; the resolution feels earned through symbolic consistency rather than emotional stakes.</comment>
