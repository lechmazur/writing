<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (archive rituals, necessary lies) are clear but underexplored; the teacher’s layered dialogue contrasts with the wanderer’s silence, which lacks emotional depth beyond stoicism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (request to lesson to departure), but the 500-word constraint flattens emotional stakes; the resolution feels abrupt despite strong conceptual closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive via tactile details (chalk vanishing, “living” shadows) and symbolic setting, but the “moment a teacher wipes the formula away” lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (“shadows twisting like living things”) and subtext on truth vs. imposition elevate the story; dialogue is stylized but purposeful, though emotional impact is uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with fresh metaphors (“nightmares patient as always”), but some phrases (e.g., “dry leaves scattering”) veer toward convention; originality diluted by ornate language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly propel the narrative; the story’s brevity feels intentional but restricts deeper exploration of the central conflict.</comment>
