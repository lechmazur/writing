<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (cosmic responsibility) is clear but personality depth thin; shyness fades abruptly without organic emotional progression; actions align with motivation but psychological nuance lacking</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc but pacing uneven—resolution feels rushed despite tight structure; cause/effect logical but emotional stakes underdeveloped; social media as plot driver strains believability</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details immerse readers but parallel timelines underutilized; atmosphere complements regret theme but setting-character integration superficial</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (shattered mirror, photos) elevate narrative, but emotional resonance diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction; ending satisfies thematically yet lacks visceral impact</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mix of fresh (social media clues) and familiar (underwater ruins); "echo of regret" borders on cliché; prose occasionally lush to point of obscuring character authenticity</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements with thematic consistency, though some components (timelines, disinterest) feel tacked-on rather than organically developed; conceptually ambitious but execution uneven</comment>
