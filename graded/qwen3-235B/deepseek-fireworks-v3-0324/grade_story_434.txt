<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation hinges on vague ancestral duty; voice is distinct but actions/traits occasionally contradict ("commonly individual" lacks meaningful integration).</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses through atmospheric beats rather than clear cause-effect, though the zero-gravity flame climax feels disconnected from earlier tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (burnt sugar, whispering walls) clash with underdeveloped explanations for how the booth/zero gravity connect logically to the artifact's purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("knowledge is a slippery thing") elevate the narrative, but lacks thematic depth beyond surface-level struggle against inevitability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bypasses some clich√©s (artifact guardianship) but stumbles into purple prose ("whispering walls in forgotten languages") and inconsistent emotional nuance in static ancestral voices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements like the napkin and flame are tightly woven, but the forced "commonly individual" attribute and underexplained zero-gravity mechanics undermine cohesion.</comment>
