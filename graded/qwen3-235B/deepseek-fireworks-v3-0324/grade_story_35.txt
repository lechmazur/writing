<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's silent motivation and connection to the purse are consistent, but interiority lacks sufficient depth; reactions to memories feel rushed without gradual emotional escalation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by compressed arc; critical moments (memories, stranger's appearance) lack causal groundwork, creating episodic leaps that undermine pacing cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere with avian motifs and humming spires creates immersive liminality; storm-cloud eyes and tactile soil details amplify emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (language of longing) avoid cliche; emotional subtext emerges through nuanced gesture rather than exposition; distinctive lyrical voice maintains tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of elements creates lasting thematic resonance; brevity occasionally sacrifices narrative complexity; stylistic elegance compensates for constrained scope.</comment>
