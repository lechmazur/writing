<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent, but motivations remain slightly underdeveloped beyond inherited duty. Emotional reactions feel authentic but are shown more than explored in psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc within constraints, but pacing falters slightly in middle section. The cause-effect between stealing the scale and final restoration works logically within magical context.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original approach to heritage narrative, but some phrasing (like "aurora flared brighter") borders on clich√©. Emotional subtlety prevents full AI-suspicions but lacks deeper stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements create satisfying whole despite tight word limit. The ending especially feels earned rather than artificially imposed, leaving room for emotional reverberation.</comment>
