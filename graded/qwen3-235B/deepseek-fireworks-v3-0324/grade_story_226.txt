<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (saving child's sleep) is clear and consistent, actions align with desperation. However, motivations lack complexity beyond archetypal parent trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear beginning/middle/end. Pacing manages emotional progression, but some plot mechanics (skull's function) remain underdeveloped despite constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere created through specific details (glowing sockets, rusted tuning fork) but setting connections (resonance facility's purpose) feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through showing, not telling. Vivid imagery ("voice stretched thin across time"), satisfying thematic closure, but subtext could run deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original concept execution with fresh metaphors ("genuinely artificial") avoids genre tropes. Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyricism, though some phrasing risks preciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work in concert to create emotional depth. Story benefits from compression rather than feeling limited, with lingering thematic resonance about art and memory.</comment>
