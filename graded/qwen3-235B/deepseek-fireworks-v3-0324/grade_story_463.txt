<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and internal conflict, but motivations tied to learning "traditional methods" feel underexplored relative to the depth of symbolic elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has cohesive arc but pacing feels slightly uneven - the dance confrontation dominates without sufficient buildup or resolution within the tight word constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with original metaphors and subtext, but contains occasional generically ornate phrases that slightly dilute the otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements integrate cohesively with atmospheric consistency, though certain connections (dance's function) work against achieving transcendent thematic integration within the brief format.</comment>
