<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the conjurer's gentle nature informs her restorative actions, her internal struggles and past remain underexplored. Emotional beats like her "tears" are stated but not deeply embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing feels uneven in places—the garden's abrupt resurgence after the dwarves' sudden shift from fear to awe lacks transitional nuance despite a satisfying thematic arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., humming runes) immerse readers, but the underground city’s contrast with the garden leans on clichéd industrial vs. natural binaries without deeper socio-political subtext.</comment>
