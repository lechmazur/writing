<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but not deeply embodied; motivation (study soil) conflicts with abrupt shift to imposing order; "sensibly eccentric" is insufficiently demonstrated through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented structure relies on abstract connections rather than cause-effect; the shift from observation to creation lacks psychological depth; ending feels thematically resolved but narratively compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies heavily on cryptic descriptors but lacks immersive sensory specificity; the giant’s shoe setting could deepen psychological undertones but remains primarily symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story employs rich metaphors (whip as authority, soil as dialogue), but emotional impact is muted by overly abstract characterization; ending achieves symbolic cohesion yet feels intellectually detached.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concepts avoid overt clichés but skate the edge of New Age abstraction; poetic phrases (“veins mapping earth’s desires”) occasionally veer into purple prose; subtext struggles to escape metaphorical density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements function but lack organic interdependence; symbolic overbuild weakens narrative immediacy; brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, with underdeveloped tensions between autonomy and control.</comment>
