<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to break curses is explicit but lacks psychological depth; the troubadour's actions (singing, touching fabric) feel symbolic without revealing nuanced inner conflict or growth. Emotional stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Circular structure (ring at start/end) provides closure, but the transformation's mechanics are vague. Pacing balances poetic description with sparse plot, though cause-effect between rituals and curse-breaking remains under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting's tactile decay (creaking gantries, storm, rust) and eerie beauty immerse readers. Atmosphere mirrors thematic tension between ruin and rebirth; sensory details consistently elevate mood and metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Densely layered metaphors (embroidery as ancestral trauma, torpedo as catharsis) feel original. Stylistic flourishes occasionally border on ornamentation, but the narrative voice maintains a distinct, haunting cadence that avoids formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution. The story's brevity sharpens its mythic tone but undermines the resolution's emotional weight; lingering questions about the curse's transformation suggest depth without full payoff.</comment>
