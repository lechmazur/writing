<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character transitions lack nuance; while fatal flaws shape his journey, emotional shifts feel abrupt. His transformation hinges on holographic exposition rather than earned self-realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compressed pacing—forgiveness arc rushes past vengeance’s psychological weight. Concept ties together but lacks layered buildup to resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dilapidated tech fused with organic decay creates haunting, specific atmosphere. Server hums and maggot imagery anchor mood, though spaceport’s backstory remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (e.g., worms to silk, cookbook duality) elevates emotional resonance. Ending avoids schmaltz while retaining thematic clarity, though dialogue occasionally veers into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aversion of war-to-chef trope is inventive but risks feeling schematic. Sensory details mostly vivid, though "elasticize" and "precisely innovative" flirt with contrived metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interweave thematically (forgiveness via culinary subversion) and structurally, with tight economy of language privileging brevity over superfluity.</comment>
