<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation told rather than shown through nuanced behavior or backstory. Actions driven by plot demands, not organic development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot mechanics functional but underdeveloped. Cause-effect relationships exist but feel rushed. Pacing uneven; resolution occurs abruptly without sufficient build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid visual language compensates for inconsistent tonal integration. Atmospheric elements suggest depth but remain superficially rendered; "jaded wonder" feels imposed rather than inherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors enhance thematic resonance. Emotional impact diluted by abstract resolutions and underdeveloped human stakes. Subtext about cultural memory is present but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by clich√©d phrasing ("whispers in the wind") and tonal inconsistencies. Magical realism tropes deployed without sufficient subversion; atmospheric cohesion occasionally feels algorithmically constructed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fragments of cohesion exist, but forced elements disrupt narrative unity. Style oscillates between lyrical and overly ornate. Limited emotional resonance despite ambitious thematic scope.</comment>
