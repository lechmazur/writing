<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (acceptance, proving worth) are clear but superficially developed; "rationally emotional" is stated rather than embodied through nuanced decisions; reactions to the clover and outsiders lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels constrained by word count; transitions between corridors, shattering clover, and outsider confrontation are rushed; cause/effect of "synchronized watch alarms" driving action lacks logical scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (rust/cotton candy, groaning funhouse) masterfully evoke dissonant jubilant despair; setting actively shapes character psychology and symbolic resonance; haunted amusement park transcendently captures emotional schism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("ship about to sink", "noose of contradictions") are potent; ending achieves thematic payoff with map-torn autonomy; dialogue remains functional rather than distinctive; emotional resonance is implied more than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes in setting but leans on "broken relic = inner brokenness" trope; descriptive language is purposeful but occasionally veers toward ornate ("jubilant despair hanging thick as fog"); characterization contains human nuance but lacks idiosyncratic unpredictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Packs density of ideas into limited space effectively; elements serve plot mechanics more than thematic depth; the "map tearing" conceit lingers provocatively but unevenly developed; tonal consistency amid multiple assigned concepts is impressively maintained.</comment>
