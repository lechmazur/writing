<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (longing for peace) is present but underexplored; "shakiness" is superficially tied to trauma without visceral emotional depth; dialogue reveals hesitancy but lacks layered internal-external conflict contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Decent structural arc compressed into brevity, but the pivotal action (breaking amber) feels rushed; cause-effect of the spider's activation lacks suspense buildup; pacing uneven during conceptual payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive cathedral decay with neon/graffiti contrast; amber temperature shift effectively anchors supernatural moment; twilight timeframe as both literal/metaphorical dying light enhances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of entombed past realized; ending achieves thematic resonance through action rather than exposition; occasional static descriptions ("crunching glass") show tension, but emotional states often stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s, but redemption arc predictability tempered by unique amber symbolism; some vibrant imagery balances slightly overused "echoing hour" trope; emotional nuance lacks specificity beyond generic weariness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements that occasionally strain under grand thematic ambitions; length feels purposeful but constrains character complexity; ending lingers through physical action (fallen amber) rather than overexplained closure.</comment>
