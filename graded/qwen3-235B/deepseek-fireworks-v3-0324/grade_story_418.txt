<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Weakness in Elara's internal transition; her headstrong nature resurfaces sporadically but isn't consistently interrogated. The courage to confess motivation feels underexplored until the climax. Mara's inclusion adds depth but interactions remain transactional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows clean three-act arc within constraints, but the pivotal action of mixing glitter with dust lacks procedural specificity. The revelation of Mara's sigil feels unearned; emotional beats outpace narrative development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original, with radioactive dust storms and glowing fruit creating a haunting yet hopeful sensory palette. The wasteland's decay contrasts effectively with Elara's glitter intervention, though Mara's sudden shift in demeanor isn't fully grounded in the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of glitter as memory/revival resonates, and the final line offers thematic closure. Dialogue avoids clich√©, but emotional resonance relies too heavily on direct statements ("the world needed more than spells"). The theme of collaboration emerges but lacks deeper interrogation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some overly ornate phrasing mars pacing ("feminizing the harsh landscape with flecks"), and the wasteland mage trope feels rehashed. The stained glass box and costume residue are inventive, but the "merry bitterness" tone remains underdeveloped despite strong setup.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole, with the brief length serving concentrated impact. The synthesis of decay/beauty through glitter is clever, though some components (Mara's sigil) feel hastily introduced. Leaves lingering questions about post-apocalyptic renewal but lacks depth in secondary character exploration.</comment>
