<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation exists but lacks nuance; odd habits don't organically shape actions or fate. Stated motivations outweigh demonstrated depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by action-object relationship, but conclusion feels perfunctory; cause-effect logic holds despite compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong gothic atmosphere with evocative details, though setting connections remain surface-level; chamber and cathedral coexist without deeper symbolic harmony.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually striking metaphors and thematic echoes elevate impact; ending resonates conceptually despite thin emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic traps; combines genre elements with inventive execution (vibration tech/magic fusion) though some sentences veer toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally cohesive despite uneven element integration; formal risks (backward tunes, sensory contrasts) suggest authorial vision constrained by brevity.</comment>
