<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (tracking consciousness, seeking rhythm) remain abstract; actions lack nuanced internal logic. Dialogue-driven revelations feel convenient rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on arbitrary "chance encounters" rather than causal momentum; structure compresses too much conceptual weight into limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent visuals and tactile scrimshaw details create immersive atmosphere; setting functions more as aesthetic than thematic catalyst.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads, barricades) add conceptual depth but emotional impact diluted by didactic exposition; theme of art's transient power not fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through poetic specificity (scrimshaw's "pulse," algae's "sharp/sweet" memory); maintains consistent dreamlike tone despite structural contrivances.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but structurally uneven; successfully interweaves core elements while struggling with narrative compression and character dimensionality.</comment>
