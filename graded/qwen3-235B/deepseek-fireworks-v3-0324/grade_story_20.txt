<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character is symbolically resonant but lacks layered depth; motivations (regret, resolve) are clear but psychological nuance is occasionally oversimplified, particularly in rapid emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot achieves compact arc with organic cause-effect; confrontational action with the comb and bridge drives progression, though the abrupt pivot to documenting movements feels underdeveloped but within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly immersive with celestial imagery and surreal inverted waterfall; the setting meaningfully mirrors character's internal state through metaphor and sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skilled use of metaphor (waterfall, comb) and subtext elevates thematic impact; ending resonates as earned resolution, with layered tension between stagnation and renewal effectively woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in symbolic elements (inverted waterfall, bridge of regret) avoids cliché, though occasional descriptors (“shimmering arc”) border on conventionality; emotional arc feels human despite lyrical density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve theme without feeling contrived; brevity enhances focus on transformational moment; closing image of movement toward the valley lingers as resonant metaphor.</comment>
