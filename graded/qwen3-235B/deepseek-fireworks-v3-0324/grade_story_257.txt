<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s intellectual overqualification and longing for purpose are established but lack nuanced development of how her past shaped her. The stranger’s influence feels underexplored, weakening the catalyst for her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot progression is coherent but relies on convenience (e.g., stranger’s timely arrival). The leap from stifled waitress to self-liberation is emotionally resonant yet structurally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (chalk-dust, firefly-lit postcards) create a rich atmosphere, but the fireflies’ mystical presence feels loosely tied to the narrative’s thematic core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (chalkboard as rebirth, postcards as fractured beauty) are potent. The ending resonates thematically, though dialogue’s brevity occasionally flattens its emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (mysterious stranger, yearning protagonist). Language is clear but occasionally sacrifices specificity for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like the chalkboard and postcards are purposeful, but the fireflies and stranger feel contrived. The story’s brevity works but leaves some thematic threads unresolved.</comment>
