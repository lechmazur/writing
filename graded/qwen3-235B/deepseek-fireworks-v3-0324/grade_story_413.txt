<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's listlessness and naivety shape his arc, but motivations and inner conflicts remain underexplored. Transformation feels abrupt, lacking psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing stumbles during pivotal moments. Maze exploration lacks stakes to sustain momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (rustling corn, twilight-eyed woman), but "haunted plain" concept remains superficially integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective symbolism elevates the narrative (scarf, laughter, stalk), but emotional resonance is uneven. Ending delivers thematic closure yet lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in concept (pre-sentience setting, intention-as-portal) but relies on familiar mystical mentor tropes (twilight-eyed woman). Language balances lyricism with purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some - like the pre-sentience timeframe - feel decorative rather than foundational. Concision serves the meditative tone but limits emotional richness.</comment>
