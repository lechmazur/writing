<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strengths: Motivation clearly tied to decoding carvings; comb as symbolic tool reinforces profession. Weakness: Ruthlessness feels superficial, only hinted through dialogue, not decisive actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Plot unfolds naturally, with comb’s use driving key discovery. Weakness: Pacing slightly uneven; stranger’s introduction feels abrupt despite functional integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strengths: Vivid, eerie atmosphere via sensory details (shifting carvings, humming air, shadows); tone supports mystery. Weakness: "Polite anarchy" concept underutilized, serving more as description than thematic force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Poetic devices (e.g., comb as "relic of discovery") enhance theme of hidden meaning; ending lingers metaphorically. Weakness: Emotional impact is muted; reliance on abstract mood over grounded character stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strengths: Avoids clichés through unique object-function pairing (comb as key) and fresh metaphors ("polite anarchy of discovery"). Weakness: Some phrasing edges on ornate ("frayed teeth," "burden settled like fingers") without adding depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strengths: Elements cohesively interlinked (comb connects profession to discovery); concise length feels purposeful. Weakness: Thematic ambiguity risks leaving readers unsatisfied; thematic emphasis on "watcher’s burden" underdeveloped.</comment>
