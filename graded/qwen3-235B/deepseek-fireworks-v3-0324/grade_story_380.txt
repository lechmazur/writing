<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's fragmented self and guilt are clear, but his "mathematically challenged" trait lacks integration with actions/motivation. Emotional arc is compelling yet underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plunge drives the plot, but transitions between memories and physical actions feel abrupt. Coherence exists but struggles with pacing constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., creaking treehouse, scent of rain) build a haunting mood. Timeframe ("after last human") is atmospheric but loosely tied to plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (album as fragmented self) and symbolic resolution are potent. Ending balances abruptness with thematic resonance. Language occasionally flirts with overwrought prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</comment>Original premise avoids tropes, but archery as a shared sport feels contrived. Emotional nuance avoids AI-clich√©s, though mathematical challenged trait relies on stated traits over subtext.</grade>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but uneven. Elements like the album are integral, while others (e.g., timeframe) feel underutilized. Brevity suits theme but leaves subtext slightly unearned.</comment>
