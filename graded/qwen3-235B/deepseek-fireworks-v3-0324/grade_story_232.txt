<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (decoding inscriptions) is clear but shallow; the physician's obsession lacks psychological depth or meaningful evolution. His reactions to the cutlass and temple are atmospheric but don't reveal nuanced personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear path but struggles with pacing—transitions between camp and temple feel abrupt. The connection between beginning/end is present but perfunctory; cause/effect relationships rely on vague "enchantment" rather than organic logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (salt, shadows, temple's glow) create atmosphere, but the digital nomad camp feels underdeveloped and contrasted more superficially than thematically. The cutlass and setting share symbolic tension but aren't deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("salt and old magic") and symbolic objects elevate style, but emotional impact is diluted by reliance on vague mystical concepts. The ending is purposeful but lacks thematic resonance beyond surface mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive descriptive phrases ("quietly dramatic energy," "hush of horizon’s edge") border on formulaic. The trope of cursed pirate lore and obsessed archaeologist lacks subversion; emotional stakes are indicated rather than shown through nuanced character work.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interdependence—e.g., the digital nomad premise feels tacked onto the temple quest. The brevity serves mood but sacrifices thematic complexity; the story leans on atmosphere over structural ambition.</comment>
