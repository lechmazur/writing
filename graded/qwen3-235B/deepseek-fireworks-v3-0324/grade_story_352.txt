<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits are present but thinly rendered; motivations are clear yet lack layered development or personal stakes beyond narrative necessities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with satisfying arcs, but the tight word limit strains cause-effect clarity (e.g., "sound of a leaf falling" mechanic feels underexplained).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistentâ€”sensory details alternate between lush and abstract, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery/symbolism elevated theme, but emotional resonance lacks the gut-punch of truly transcendent work; ending hints at deeper ideas without fully committing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept/setting fusion, but occasional overwrought descriptions ("musical traditions woven into the sky") and predictable genre beats (heist sequence) temper uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements service the story consistently yet safely; while cohesive, it achieves competence over brilliance or risk-taking in its brevity.</comment>
