<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Crane’s longing and transformation show motivation, but deeper exploration of how “awkwardly charming” or his naval background shapes his actions is missing; his trade of secrets remains undercontextualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear (longing → action → resolution), but the method of tracking moon phases feels hastily referenced, undercutting the transformation’s emotional weight and logical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and mood (e.g., “rainbow’s end a cruel joke”) immerse readers, but the fortress and canyon’s symbolic ties to his curse lack explicit thematic reinforcement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (mirror/orchid) and lyrical prose elevate the theme of self-confrontation, but emotional depth remains slightly hindered by reliance on abstract description over embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elevates genre tropes with unique imagery (ghost orchid, crystal fortress), but occasional ornate phrasing (“weight of centuries”) edges toward cliché; the mirror’s twist avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole, but uneven integration (e.g., moon phases) and uneven pacing in the tight word limit slightly undermine the story’s ambition.</comment>
