<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (search for wisdom) is clear and consistent, but the "subtle" trait lacks depth beyond physical stillness; internal conflicts remain underdeveloped despite the pivotal realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on abrupt epiphany rather than earned progression; the stranger’s intervention feels underprepared, weakening narrative momentum despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid descriptions (glowing veins, auroras), but the petrified forest’s symbolic connection to "interconnected patterns" and the schematic feels underexploited, leaving sensory details somewhat disconnected from thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story benefits from strong metaphors (schematic as mirror, wisdom as pattern recognition) and a resonant theme, but the predictable "enlightenment via stranger" trope weakens emotional impact despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Uses archetypal elements (wise stranger, symbolic device) without meaningful subversion; some poetic phrasing borders on purple prose, while the swordsman’s sudden clarity lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds in thematic cohesion and compact structure, but relies on familiar narrative beats and insufficiently explores the darker implications of the doomsday schematic, leaving depth unfulfilled.</comment>
