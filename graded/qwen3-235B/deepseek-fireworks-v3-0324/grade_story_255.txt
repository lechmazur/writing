<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Seer's motivation drives plot, but characterization remains abstract; "analytically innovative" manifests only through vague, synesthetic actions that lack concrete demonstration of skill or methodology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels compressed; the transition from "encrypted drive" to "dissolved encryption via rain" strains plausibility despite lyrical intent; thematic connection between rain and justice is conceptually sound but mechanically underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through tactile, paradoxical details (ozone + petrichor) and decaying grandeur; the tower's physicality mirrors thematic contradictions between justice and entropy better than narrative execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("innocent cynicism") and layered symbols elevate impact; however, emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract prose that obscures character specificity and narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes, particularly in blending tech (USB drive) with mythic structure; occasional purple prose ("weight of years piled like unread files") distracts, but overall demonstrates singular vision with minimal formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion around justice-as-process justifies tight structure; sacrifices character depth for conceptual ambition, leaving some assigned elements feeling superimposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>
