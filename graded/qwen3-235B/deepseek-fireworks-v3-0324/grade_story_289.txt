<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to find lost civilizations is clear but underdeveloped; her reliance on the doll as a talisman and mantra hints at depth but lacks emotional nuance. Her “awkward elegance” contrasts with her actions, but her character remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc (art as message → stranger encounter → revelation) but feels rushed. The abrupt climax (doll revealing glyphs) lacks buildup, and the stranger’s exposition weakens tension. Pacing balances atmosphere and progression unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Richly evoked setting with vivid imagery (bioluminescence, twin moons), but connections between atmosphere and plot are superficial. The bay’s role in revealing glyphs adds cohesion, but the FTL timeframe rarely influences stakes or character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (fragility as strength, art as communication) and atmospheric prose elevate the story. The ending lacks thematic surprise, though; the stranger’s dialogue borders on didactic. Tension between logic and creativity hints at deeper subtext but remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stranger’s “shifting constellations” and mantra-like dialogue feel clichéd. Some prose (e.g., “swirling constellations of light”) borders on purple. The doll-as-map twist introduces originality, but character reactions rely on predictable beats (awe, resolve).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion but leans on familiar tropes (lonely seeker, enigmatic guide). Elements like the doll and bay are well-integrated, but the resolution feels neat rather than resonant. The theme lingers, but the brevity sacrifices depth.</comment>
