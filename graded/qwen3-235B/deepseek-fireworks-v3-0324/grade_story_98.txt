<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness drives action but lacks psychological depth; motivation to learn ancient writings is consistent but underexplored beyond surface fear/craving dichotomy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc and cause-effect logic, but pacing feels uneven—ruler's shattering and escape occur abruptly without sufficient emotional payoff for the setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (pulsing threads, thickened air) create immersive atmosphere; the secret society setting's symbolism enhances tone but lacks concrete cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric interplay between ruler/tapestry and theme of false security; ending thematically resonant but some imagery (e.g., "intimately distant") remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés; the tapestry's void-reveal twist is inventive. Occasional purple prose ("drifting patterns," "labyrinth of threads") and underdeveloped emotional nuance suggest algorithmic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around core elements but feels constrained by its checklist-driven construction; the brief format works for dreamlike ambiguity but undermines character depth and thematic complexity.</comment>
