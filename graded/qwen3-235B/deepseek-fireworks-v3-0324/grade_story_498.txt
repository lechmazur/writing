<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's nervousness and defiance are evident but lack depth; motivation to counter indifference is clear yet underdeveloped. Actions align with traits, but voice feels generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution. Pacing is efficient, though midwinter timeframe's role feels underutilized. Cause-and-effect is logical, but the detour disrupts flow slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral (midwinter chill, brittle pods) and enhances themes. Xenophobic enclave's oppressive tone is evocative, though political context remains vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story uses symbolism (seeds as rebellion) powerfully. Ending resonates emotionally, though dialogue lacks nuance. Subtext about grassroots change is strong and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar motifs (hope in winter). Sensory details are vivid but occasionally overwrought. Emotional resonance is genuine but occasionally stated overtly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story integrates elements tightly, though the detour and "unlikely probable" feel forced. Themes are cohesive, and brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering, hopeful impact.</comment>
