<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Wealth of traits hinted, but emotional depth remains surface-level; halfhearted commitment lacks nuanced psychological exploration despite symbolic resonance of spoon/memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean arc from hesitation to resolve within constraints, but lullaby translation mechanics feel underdeveloped; cause-effect between memory and renewed resolve rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crystalline imagery visceral but inconsistent - some transitions between tactile spoon and abstract mental architecture jarring; gloomy cheerfulness conceptually rich yet tonally uneven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of memory-as-physical-space and emotional machinery avoids genre tropes; spoon's archetypal nurturing symbolism borders on clich√©, lullaby translation method feels vaguely defined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into melancholic whole despite structural tightness; precise language elevates concept but occasional rhythmic stumbles prevent transcendent brevity.</comment>
