<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Scarce emotional depth for the necromancer beyond cryptic mystique; motivations hinted but underexplored. Lira’s determination contrasts effectively but feels archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Concise, cohesive arc within constraints; fissure sequence drives momentum. Pacing falters slightly mid-story, lingering on dialogue before climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion (crystalline glint, glowing ore) anchors the setting. "Futuristic nostalgia" only superficially explored through gear.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (drip=resolve) resonate. Sparse but potent prose; ending leaves lingering intrigue. Subtext about partnership lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Blends necromancer trope with spelunking—fresh twist, but "crystalline teeth" and "dying star" risk cliché. Avoids overt purple prose but leans on familiar imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Functional cohesion; elements serve plot but lack thematic synergy. Brief length amplifies brevity’s edge but limits complexity.</comment>
