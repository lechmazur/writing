<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character exhibits consistent brazen humility and nonchalance through actions and dialogue, but lacks depth beyond archetypal eccentricity; motivation ties to core concept but remains superficially explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from scene to climax with integrated cause-effect, but the tight word limit forces abrupt transitions and a resolution that feels somewhat rushed despite cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich steampunk atmosphere with vivid sensory details, but setting functions more as backdrop than active force shaping plot or character; atmosphere supports tone but isn't deeply intertwined with central conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strikes a balance between poetic metaphors ("madness as a horizon") and thematic cohesion. The ending loops effectively, but emotional resonance and subtlety in character reactions are occasionally sacrificed for grand gestures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity with fresh metaphors and voice, but occasionally veers toward stylized excess; some phrases ("taming chaos with a shrug") feel slightly contrived. Maintains consistent tone but leans on bard archetype rather than subverting it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole with deliberate stylistic choices and thematic continuity. Slightly strained integration of timeframe and method, but overall demonstrates creative synthesis. Ending lingers thematically without overstaying its brief format.</comment>
