<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character displays surface growth but lacks emotional depth; motivations about fear vs. reason are stated rather than earned through visceral reactions. Dialogue feels more like thematic scaffolding than lived-in psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Compact arc works within word limits but relies heavily on abstract thematic beats over concrete plot progression. Pacing stumbles slightly in photo reflection segment but maintains overall momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stellar sensory world-building with cosmic transit hums and ionized regret stenches creates immersive, cohesive atmosphere. Each setting detail reinforces existential dread motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density risks saturation but powerful closing image of "throne room redecoration" elevates. Dialogic wit and symbolic photos create resonant thematic layering about fear's persistence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strikes balance between poetic originality and clich√©d frameworks ("dance partner," "throne"). Some phrases veer toward lyrical abstraction over concrete human truth, bordering on self-parody.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements serve story thematically but occasionally strain credibility (seaweed's significance). Leaves philosophical question about fear's coexistence with courage, but emotional grounding remains partial.</comment>
