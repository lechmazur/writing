<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Assassin's motivation and backstory lack clarity; hesitations feel unearned. Poet's trembling hands mirroring assassin's is forced, undermining emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing stumbles between setup and resolution. The artificial night's arrival serves as limp climax; abrupt decision to spare poet lacks narrative buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Baroque asteroid" concept underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., camera lens paint splatters) inconsistently tied to emotional states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Spider's web metaphor elevates theme of entrapment vs. freedom. Ending achieves emotional weight through understated physical contact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clich√©s ("hollow as corridors") undercut originality. "Lurking ghost with camera" fresh but over-explained. Lens symbolism borders on pretentious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy. Brief length obscures deeper character exploration that could have elevated the narrative.</comment>
