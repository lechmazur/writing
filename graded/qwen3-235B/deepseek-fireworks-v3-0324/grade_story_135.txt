<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Focused but thin motivation; brewer backstory underexploited. Loyalty theme surfaces through actions but lacks psychological layering.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Precipitous plot pivot via wind event risks logical gaps; tight closure achieved but feels hasty. Temporal compression strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory worldbuilding (frost/steam/mechanical decay) masterfully reinforces thematic silence vs. linguistic preservation. Timeframe oddly peripheral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance (straw-as-quill, caravans-as-graveyards) elevates theme; closing inspirational surge edged toward clich√©. Lacks emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("pregnant with possibility"). Sensory details vivid yet occasionally formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive but conceptually narrow; elements serve theme efficiently without surprising intersections. Lingering thought on language extinction competently rendered.</comment>
