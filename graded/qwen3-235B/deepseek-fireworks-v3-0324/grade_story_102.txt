<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness and redemption arc lack emotional depth; transformation feels abrupt despite hints at betrayal and self-confrontation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot begins strongly but loses momentum in transition to the chamber; climax is emotionally resonant but pacing inconsistent within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details establish atmosphere; map room and shifting maps are immersive but timeframe integration feels symbolic rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Luminous doubt and dollhouse symbolism elevate the text; ending delivers thematic weight through subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elegantly subverts artifact-driven fantasy tropes; some phrasing ("luminous doubt") risks pretension but overall maintains stylistic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around thematic unity but narrative feels compressed; short form is both a strength and limitation in emotional payoff.</comment>
