<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Minimal character depth; motivations implied but underexplored. Interactions feel archetypal rather than organic. Dialogue lacks distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abrupt transitions (kiss, instant collaboration). Premise established but resolution feels rushed. Some cause-effect logic strained within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (sanctuary vs. markets) enhance mood. Symbolism (antiseptic/ink/feathers) reinforces themes but secondary elements (birds) underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (crayon doodles as map, crumbling flower) effective but surface-level. Ending hints at themes without emotional resonance. Tension lacks sustained stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Visionary concepts (lost tech, creativity) undercut by predictable tropes (secretive quest, romantic spark). Sensory details fresh but dialogue and dynamics feel rehearsed. Missed opportunities for subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Coherence achieved but relies on contrivances (doodles-as-map). Premise teases deeper inquiry but opts for tidy resolution. Lingering intrigue diluted by underdeveloped themes.</comment>
