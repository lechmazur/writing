<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Immortality is superficially expressed through fleeting memories but lacks tangible behavioral manifestations; motivation to restore ecosystem is consistent but emotionally abstracted rather than viscerally embodied through specific actions or sacrifices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but relies on undetailed cosmic-scale actions (tree-bending reality) without logical progression; cause-effect between earbud patterns and restoration lacks narrative scaffolding, weakening momentum despite satisfying circularity between barren and blooming garden.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery (glowing flowers, humming particles) creates sensory immersion, but sci-fi/magical realism blending feels intellectually inconsistent; particle garden's metaphysical properties remain unexplored in terms of ecological or character logic, diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ephemeral pattern metaphors and unresolved ending evoke thematic resonance about impermanent healing, but excessive abstract description ("rigidly flexible bark," "ink of forgotten events") undercuts emotional immediacy compared to showing nuanced character vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of quantum physics with ecosystem stewardship avoids typical tropes, though phrases like "laughing wind through dead leaves" risk poetic predictability; some descriptors ("shimmered/faded memories") border on formulaic abstraction rather than distinct, visceral imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines unconventional elements into a thematically unified narrative but struggles with tonal consistency (bitter hope feels imposed rather than earned); brevity highlights structural gaps more than focusing narrative precision, leaving certain connections (earbud function, garden's cosmic role) underserved.</comment>
