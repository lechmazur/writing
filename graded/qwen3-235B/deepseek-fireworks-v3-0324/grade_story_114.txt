<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth despite consistent portrayal of apathy. Motivation to rebuild reefs remains superficial, actions lack transformative resonance tied to his lazily enthusiastic attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dream-logic progression lacks concrete cause-effect momentum. Framed coral creation drives plot but resists traditional structure; ends with ambiguous, unresolved tension rather than full arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ethereal decay of recording studio blends effectively with post-divine limbo. Sensory details (grinder sound, molten light) immerse reader, though spatial logic remains intentionally vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and paradoxical metaphors ("knife wrapped in silk") engage intellect. Subtext about passive creation resonates, but emotional impact muted by protagonist's detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surrealism, but relies slightly on "godless world" tropes. Some abstract passages risk vagueness rather than provocative ambiguity. Coffee grinder detail shows originality in small-scale execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize with dreamlike aesthetic, though reef rebuilding feels conceptually thinner than atmospheric components. Style serves theme effectively within limited scope, leaves philosophical echoes without over-explaining.</comment>
