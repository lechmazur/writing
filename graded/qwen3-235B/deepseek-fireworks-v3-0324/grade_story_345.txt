<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lapsed priest's motivations are abstractly tied to his past faith, but emotional depth remains vague; confusion is consistent but lacks tangible grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc from complacency to choice is clear, but pacing feels rushed at the clearing's abrupt resolution; snow patterns as a guiding method lacks full explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gothic atmosphere excels; bean stalks as ancient ribs and the dull radiance create oppressive yet ethereal tension. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally overwhelming.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (fraying thread, abacus gaps) masterfully; ending resonates as thematic release. Subtext about self-determination elevates the narrative beyond surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with unique imagery (bean stalk ribs, snow patterns), but some phrases ("ancient beast," "blank slate") verge on overused. Emotional beats veer toward introspective abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive theme of reckoning unites elements, though the brevity leaves some concepts underexplored; the length works as a poetic allegorical vignette.</comment>
