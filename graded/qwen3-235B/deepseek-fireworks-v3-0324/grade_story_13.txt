<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth and personal stakes; transformation feels abstract rather than earned through nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on poetic motifs to bridge plot gaps; transitions between scenes feel underdeveloped despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative, tactile descriptions (damp soil/jasmine, shifting sands) create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "chameleon petals," "sculptor time") and metaphorical layering effectively evoke introspection, though emotional resonance remains subdued.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("hungry desert") that feels more decorative than integral to the story.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the theme of transformation; the brevity serves the mythic tone but sacrifices deeper character engagement.</comment>
