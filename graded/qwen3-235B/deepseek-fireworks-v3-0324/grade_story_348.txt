<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's somnambulism and curiosity are present but underexplored; motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression toward sacred task, but minimal conflict or resolution; cyclical structure offers closure but lacks narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich, immersive descriptions (e.g., "laboratory breathed") and sensory details enhance mood, though occasional over-lyricism slightly dilutes authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (ley-line mapping with fireflies) and theme of humility elevate the narrative, but emotional resonance is restrained by abstract, diffuse characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unique premise with mystical elements avoids overt formulaicity; some risk of generic "enchanted forest" tropes, but execution feels purposeful and distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, though slight conceptual fragmentation and underdeveloped motifs (e.g., flights, pilgrimage) prevent full literary mastery.</comment>
