<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Politeness defines the sorcerer's interactions, but motivation for studying cultural evolution lacks sufficient emotional grounding despite influencing key choices. Dialogue-driven traits occasionally feel performative rather than psychologically complex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by eavesdropping and box mechanics holds coherence despite tight constraints, though transitions between chamber and grove require greater narrative scaffolding to prevent disorientation in the compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory fusion (salt crystals as frozen tears, silence-as-seedpod) creates immersive tension. Chamber and oak juxtapositions amplify thematic contrasts, though laundry cycle motif remains underdeveloped atmospheric dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor density (rivers carving stone, whispers solidifying) elevates thematic resonance. Subtext about listening as radical cultural participation emerges powerfully through action-resistance structure and haunting closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clich√©s through idiosyncratic combinations (laundry enchantments, dread-tooth), but some phrasing ("whispers solidified into figures") skirts familiar spirit-summoning tropes. Emotional impact prioritizes conceptual elegance over raw sentiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements function as organic narrative gears rather than checklist items. Brevity enhances thematic urgency, though ending's acceleration revelation benefits from being teased more explicitly earlier for maximal cohesion.</comment>
