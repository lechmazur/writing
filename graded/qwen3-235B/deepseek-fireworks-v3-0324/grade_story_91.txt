<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent with assigned traits, but lacks depth in internal conflict or psychological complexity; the 'surprisingly gentle' attribute is effectively demonstrated through actions but underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a complete arc but pacing feels uneven in places; cause and effect relationships are logical but some developments (like storm sequence) feel compressed; the beginning/end resonance is strong but mid-story tension could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through vivid sensory details and symbolic setting elements; the weather station's mechanical decay contrasting with natural rebirth enhances theme. Timeframe "amid ghost stories" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (cloud shadows as metaphor, fedora's evolving symbolism); ending resonates thematically; subtext about quiet transformation works beautifully. Emotional impact lingers through poetic understatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls; metaphors feel fresh (bullet holes becoming flower vessels); no clunky transitions or overused descriptors. Some descriptions border on ornate but serve thematic purpose. Tonal consistency is meticulous.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively; the short length feels deliberate. Story transcends premise through thematic resonance; leaves lingering questions about beauty and revolution. Minor inconsistencies in element integration prevent perfect score.</comment>
