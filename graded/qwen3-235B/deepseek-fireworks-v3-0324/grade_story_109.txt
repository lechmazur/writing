<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's cold nature and rebellion are consistent, but the emotional thaw feels slightly rushed; motivation drives actions, though internal struggles lack deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pacing falters in explaining the remedy’s mechanics; the crossroads encounter feels abrupt, and tighter integration of cause-effect within the word limit is needed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the icy atmosphere and mystical elements, though the secret agent center’s role feels inconsistently fused with folk motifs, slightly undermining cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphors of fabric-as-story and thawing identity; the ending’s thematic unity (hope, human connection) elevates the narrative, though dialogue could be leaner.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in blending knightly tropes with spy-thriller shades, but "lawfully rebellious" and "artistic awakening" lean on clichés. Prose is evocative without veering into purple, though some emotional beats lean on "telling" rather than "showing."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Cohesive in blending assigned elements, though the secret agent center serves more as a backdrop than a driver; the story’s brevity sharpens impact but leaves underdeveloped threads (e.g., agent center’s surveillance tension).</comment>
