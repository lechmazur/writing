<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's occupation and ghost whispering are somewhat integrated, motivation to step from father's shadow is clear but underexplored through action. Emotional reactions rely too heavily on direct description rather than nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear progression through the gallery offers structural coherence with beginning/middle/end. Pacing is uneven â€“ some transitions between ghost interaction and physical actions feel rushed despite effective resolution of her emotional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details establish atmospheric decay and spectral nostalgia. The carnival setting works symbiotically with the melancholic tone, but deeper connection between specific elements (e.g., shooting gallery architecture) and ghostly revelations could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism with amber and thawing heart creates layered emotional impact. The ending's quiet transformation feels earned, though some emotional states are articulated rather than demonstrated through subtext and action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative contains some genre tropes (tragic legacy, supernatural communication through objects) that don't subvert expectations. Language occasionally veers into ornate description without adding depth. Emotional resonance exists but contains both shown and told elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesion exists between elements but many feel decorative rather than structurally essential. The brief format works for the character's brief moment of transformation, though deeper exploration of some connections would enhance impact.</comment>
