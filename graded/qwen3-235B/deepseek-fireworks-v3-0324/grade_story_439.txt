<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's muteness lacks narrative consequence; motivations hinted but not explored; actions driven by external plot rather than inner complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative progression driven by the guide's mechanics, but lacking emotional stakes; resolution rushed despite thematic consistency between comet's guidance and escape.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details meld decay and magic; atmospheric coherence elevated by storm, snow, and comet light, though otherworldly dimension remains vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic motifs (comet as celestial finger, silence as escape) evoke wonder, but thematic depth diluted by prioritizing mood over character conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sometimes veers into poetic excess without subtext, but avoids formulaic tropes; metaphors like "walls breathed" are fresh, while "mind’s escape" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements integrated with atmospheric cohesion, though brevity limits thematic payoff; the opera house’s rejuvenation hints at resonance without full emotional payoff.</comment>
