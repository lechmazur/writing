<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits are clear but underdeveloped; motivations are hinted at rather than deeply explored. Interaction reveals some nuance but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tight structure with logical cause-effect, but pacing feels rushed. The scoreboard reset ties beginning/end, though momentum falters during monster confrontation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (luminous swamp's glow, moss) enhance mood, but atmospheric consistency wavers during action scenes. Setting supports plot but lacks deeper thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth-seeking resonate. Dialogue-driven development occasionally feels stilted. Ending achieves contemplative resolution but lacks gut-punch impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with knight-rebel pairing. Sensory details specific but not overdone. Some dialogue cadence borders on formulaic but overall fresh in combining myth and academia.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but feel compressed. The tight focus on key moments suggests deliberate brevity though some arcs remain undercooked. Memorable core idea lingers post-reading.</comment>
