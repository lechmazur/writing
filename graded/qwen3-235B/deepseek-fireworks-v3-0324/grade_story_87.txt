<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits (patience, contradiction of serenity/restlessness) shape her symbolic actions but lack nuanced development; motivation to bury hatred is clear but underexplored through concrete behavior rather than abstract reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose emotional arc but feels compressed; mixtape-triggered memories and sticker-placement tie beginning/end, yet pacing unevenly juxtaposes action with introspection, leaving some transitions abrupt within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Steampunk setting delivers rich sensory immersion (brass/oil/parchment) and mood, but its mechanical elements remain decorative rather than integral to plot mechanics or character symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Linguistic precision in metaphors (cracked stickers, "savage grace") and layered subtext elevate impact; emotional resonance occasionally undercut by explicit declarations ("hollow victory") rather than fully shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but risks purple prose with phrases like "hollow victory thrummed in her chest"; mixtapes and steampunk fusion shows innovation, though some descriptors border on overwrought ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story coalesces around central themes despite tight word count; elements like stickers/mixtapes effectively anchor abstract emotions, though the steampunk worldâ€™s narrative necessity feels underjustified.</comment>
