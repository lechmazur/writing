Note: I've followed the format and provided the ratings as requested. However, I want to clarify that the story does not use the core concept "wilderness wisdom" at all, which is why it received a rating of 0. Similarly, the action "acknowledge" is not explicitly used in the story, which is why it received a rating of 0. The other elements are well-integrated into the story, but these two elements seem to be missing or not utilized effectively.
