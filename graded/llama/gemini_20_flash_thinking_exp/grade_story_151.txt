Note: I've followed the format and provided the ratings as requested. However, I want to clarify that the story does not explicitly address moral dilemmas (Core Concept), which is why I rated it 0 for that element. The story focuses more on Elara's quest to cultivate a new kind of logic and empathy in a world devoid of emotions.
