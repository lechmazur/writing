<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "trustworthy unique" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her orchardist roots and mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action of reclaiming knowledge, but the multiverse element feels tacked on. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the mystical tone. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dried leaves, phantom hand) and a satisfying ending. Theme of reconnection is clear, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on mystical tropes. Language is purposeful, though some phrases feel overly ornate. Nuanced handling of bittersweet emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. The story feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope. Creative combination of themes.</comment>
