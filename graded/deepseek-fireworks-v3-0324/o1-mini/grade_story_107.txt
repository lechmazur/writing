<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ethan's transformation from showmanship to purpose-driven quest is compelling, though his initial obsession with the crystal ball could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent, but the sudden illness feels contrived as a plot device to introduce the stranger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The island's eerie duality (silent by day, alive by night) and the insect symphony hall are vividly immersive, enhancing the mystical tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (mystical guide, hidden library). The "bitter honey" tone is evocative but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the word limit strains some transitions. Leaves a lingering reflection on wisdom and connection.</comment>
