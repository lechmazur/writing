<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Seraphiel's morose nature and motivation to restore ancient systems are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The needle's role in revealing his character is strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the blackout and chance encounter driving the narrative effectively. The resolution feels earned but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lavishly austere observatory and solar flare backdrop create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but impactful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (needle, light) and subtext (confinement vs. freedom) are well-executed. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (lonely seeker, relic as key). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers but doesnâ€™t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
