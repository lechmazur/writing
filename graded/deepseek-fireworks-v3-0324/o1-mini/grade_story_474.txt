<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ava's motivation is clear and consistent, with her radio host role and haunting nightmare shaping her actions. Leo's backstory adds depth, though his introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the celestial grotto's role feels underdeveloped, and the rebellion subplot could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "quiet rebellion" timeframe isn't fully exploited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "familiar puzzle" tone occasionally clashes with the surreal setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but some elements (rebellion, cooking class) feel marginally forced.</comment>
