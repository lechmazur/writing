<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, with his ghostwriter role and poetic rationality shaping his actions. His rebellion against imposed identities is compelling, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from constraint to autonomy. The connection between coded stanzas and his transformation is logical, though the orchestra tuning feels slightly tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground orchard and bio-luminescent fungus create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (sandals, damp earth) enhance the mood, though the orchestra's role is less integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sandals, journals) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overworked. The theme of self-determination is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("poetically rational") feel slightly forced. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, but the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of Eliot's transformation.</comment>
