<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending logic and emotion effectively. His "blameless smuggler" persona adds depth, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the climax feels slightly rushed. Overreach drives tension, but the countdown's urgency could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and garden scent create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (sound, smell) are used masterfully to enhance mood and action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism (necklace as innocence, tunnels as legacy). Literary devices elevate the prose, though the ending's reflection leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but some phrases verge on formulaic ("grandiose modesty"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant theme about legacy and balance.</comment>
