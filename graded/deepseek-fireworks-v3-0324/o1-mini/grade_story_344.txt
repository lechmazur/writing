<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's claustrophobia and underwater exploration background are intriguing but slightly underdeveloped. Her motivation to study human behaviors through jam tasting is unique and consistent, though her "lightly heavyhearted" demeanor could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced within the word limit, but the connection between jam tasting and human behavior study feels slightly forced. The ending is satisfying but could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere is immersive. Sensory details, especially taste, are used effectively to enhance mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response and uses literary devices well, but the theme of "healing touch" could be more subtly integrated. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases feel slightly flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, but the narrative could benefit from more unpredictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. It leaves a lingering thought but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
