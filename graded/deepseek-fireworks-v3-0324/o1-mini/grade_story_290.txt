<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysara's boredom and shapeshifting abilities are well-integrated, but her "intelligently foolish" attribute could be more deeply explored to justify her grand ambitions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the overthrow, though the shared taxi ride feels slightly contrived as a method. Pacing is strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the caves' "harmonic" nature could be more explicitly tied to the cosmic upheaval.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (figurine) and subtext (chaos vs. order), but some emotional depth in Lysara's transformation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "measured wildness" tone occasionally feels forced. The figurine's role is particularly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with a lingering sense of cosmic change. The brevity feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
