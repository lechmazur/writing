<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maria's motivation as an urban forager is clear, but her forgetfulness feels underutilized. Jacques' role is well-integrated, but his "wary yet intrigued" expression could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the stained-glass fragment driving the conflict. Pacing is strong, though the science fair mention feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The champagne vault is vividly rendered, but its transformation into a venue lacks sensory depth. Parisian atmosphere is evocative but slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (stained glass as fragile beauty) is effective. Ending is satisfying, though the cultural clash resolution could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (hidden vault, curator-forager dynamic). Emotional resonance is genuine but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the science fair feels tacked on. Length suits the story, leaving a lingering sense of purpose.</comment>
