<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt; his 'voice' is distinct but lacks deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the ladle's magic resolves tension too neatly. Pacing suffers slightly from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the "rush hour" timeframe clashes with the shrine's solitude.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and imagery are strong, but the emotional payoff lacks nuance. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (magic object = transformation). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its length. The ladle's magic overshadows deeper exploration.</comment>
