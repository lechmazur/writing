<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elric's motivation is clear but his "formally casual" attire feels underdeveloped as a defining trait. His hunger for knowledge is compelling but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elric's actions, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the Viking fragment and optimization is inventive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mine library is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details. The setting enhances the mystical tone and Elric's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (figurehead, discredited texts) and a haunting ending. Some prose leans ornate, but the thematic depth compensates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable arcane tropes. The "confusing certainty" tone is fresh but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the timeframe feels slightly forced. The story lingers with thematic weight, justifying its brevity.</comment>
