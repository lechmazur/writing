<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sam's assertively meek nature is subtly portrayed, but his motivation to escape digital noise feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his traits, though deeper introspection could enhance his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the blank greeting card and tapestry effectively driving the narrative. The resolution feels purposeful, though the labyrinth metaphor could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The tapestry's golden threads and firework smoke create a rich, immersive mood that supports the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (tapestry, card) and emotional resonance, though some dialogue feels stilted. The theme of human connection is clear, but deeper subtext would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the tapestry's role, but "xenialize" feels forced. The tone avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends elements, with the card and tapestry standing out. The length feels deliberate, though the labyrinth motif could be more integrated. Leaves a lingering hopeful impression.</comment>
