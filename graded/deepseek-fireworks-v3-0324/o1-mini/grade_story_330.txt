<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric's dejection and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt. The trident prong and vow add depth, but his inner conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The trident-clock interaction drives the story effectively, though the zero-gravity setting's role could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall and unexpected clock hour create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, but the "normally abnormal" concept could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (trident, clock) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused. Theme of redemption is clear but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but some phrases feel flowery or repetitive. The knight's emotional arc lacks subtlety. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into predictable tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity works, but the "deepening horizons" theme feels underdeveloped. Leaves a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
