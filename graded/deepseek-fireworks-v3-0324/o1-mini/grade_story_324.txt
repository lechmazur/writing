<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Edgar's insecurity is somewhat explored but lacks deeper nuance. His motivation is clear but feels slightly generic for an advisor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric tension over concrete progression. The ending resolves too abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric immersion, though the "simmering future" feels underdeveloped. Sensory details (echoes, shadows) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (brain in a jar) and subtext, but the theme of self-discovery is somewhat heavy-handed. Literary devices are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("fractured idyll") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ending lingers, though the journey lacks depth.</comment>
