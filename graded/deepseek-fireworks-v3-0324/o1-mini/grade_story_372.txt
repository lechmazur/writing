<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai's lovelorn spy persona is clear, but his "curiously indifferent" expression feels underdeveloped. His motivation is consistent but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The avalanche of surveillance is a strong driver, but transitions between scenes could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Neo-Tokyo's slums are vividly rendered with neon and rain, but the "new recipe" moment feels tangential to the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story struggles to balance brevity with depth. The ending lingers, though unevenly.</comment>
