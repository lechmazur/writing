<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "overzealous" trait feels underdeveloped. His connection to the notebook and grandmother's secrets is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in resolution. The orchard's shifting nature and chance encounters drive the story well, though the climax could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the mystical tone, though the "repurposed highway" connection feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, particularly the notebook and goddess. The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper into emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "familiarly unknown" notebook and chaotic organization add freshness, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
