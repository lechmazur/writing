<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's sassy, academically mischievous nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to spark chaos is clear and consistent. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "cook" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marla's actions, with a clear arc from discovery to transformation. Pacing is effective, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, imagery) are used effectively, and the story evokes thought about order vs. chaos. The ending is purposeful, though the theme could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
