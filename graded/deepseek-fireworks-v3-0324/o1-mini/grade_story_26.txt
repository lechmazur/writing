<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eliara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "singularly plural" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her sleep-deprived state and inventor role are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The DNA-to-bell animation is inventive, though the radio broadcast's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk underworld are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (light, sound) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bell as liberation) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional AI-like phrasing ("passionate subtlety"). Avoids clich√©s but could deepen nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering impact, though the DNA method strains plausibility.</comment>
