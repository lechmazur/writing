<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evan's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "hesitant raider" backstory feels underdeveloped. His stubbornly open-minded nature is well-integrated, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from raider to storyteller feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The speakeasy setting is evocative but underutilized. Midnight's hush adds atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the mug, the map) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (healing through storytelling). Some phrasing feels slightly formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story occasionally feels constrained by them. Leaves a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
