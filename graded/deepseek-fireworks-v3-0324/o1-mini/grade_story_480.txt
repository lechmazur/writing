<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is intriguing but somewhat abstract; her "indifferent enthusiasm" is a compelling contradiction, though her actions could be more vividly tied to her inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains momentum, but the transitions between secret clubs and the mess hall feel slightly abrupt. The arc is clear, though the resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with the "quietly loud" mess hall and shadowed alleyways creating a haunting, immersive mood. Sensory details are sparing but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the receipt, the final chord) and subtext about digital alienation. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "social media exorcist" concept is inventive, though some phrases ("indifferent enthusiasm") risk feeling overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about authenticity in digital connections.</comment>
