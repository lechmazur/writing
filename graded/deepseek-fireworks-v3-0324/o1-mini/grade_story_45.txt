<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her guilt driving her actions. The transparent violin adds a unique touch to her character, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The logically illogical elements work, but the road trip feels slightly forced as a method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The temple and jungle setting enhance the atmosphere, though the "silent overture of tomorrow" is somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused ("touch of wonder").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and imaginative, though some phrases feel slightly formulaic. The ice crystal violin is a fresh element, but the "dull radiance" tone is inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
