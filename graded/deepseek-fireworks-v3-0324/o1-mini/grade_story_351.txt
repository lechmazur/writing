<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's dreamy poet persona and formally rebellious nature are well-integrated, but her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" could be more explicitly tied to her past actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sundial's mechanism driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned, though the "last riddle" could be more clearly defined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station and ivy-clad setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the quietly intense tone. Sensory details like the brass sundial's shadows are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (sundial as a conduit for memory) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "delicate undoing" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "formally rebellious" trait feels slightly underdeveloped. The prose avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story well, though the "cryptic shapes" could be more integral to the plot.</comment>
