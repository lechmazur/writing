<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evelyn's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her "seldom odd" nature and focused collector trait are effectively integrated, though her "earnest flippancy" could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The board game rounds as a metaphor work, but the sudden invitation feels slightly abrupt. The frost giant's lair resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is evocative but underutilized. The black rose and solitude enhance atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse. The tone contrasts intriguingly with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (black rose, board games) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of overcoming despair is resonant. Some emotional depth could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in combining mundane (board games) with mystical (frost giant). Avoids clichés but leans slightly on predictable tropes (inner turmoil battle). Prose is purposeful, though a few phrases feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The brief length feels deliberate, and the black rose’s role is particularly inventive. Leaves a lingering reflection on solitude and resilience.</comment>
