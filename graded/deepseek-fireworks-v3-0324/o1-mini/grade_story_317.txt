<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Altair's nostalgic and anxiously fearless traits are well-integrated, but his "brazen modesty" feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his decisive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the containment protocol and confrontation lack depth. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing suffers in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The levitation facility and breaking dawn create a vivid atmosphere, though the cave's crystal growth could be more sensory-rich. The brass telescope is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (telescope as hope) works, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable android tropes and occasional flowery prose ("bittersweet nostalgia"). Some metaphors (crystals as energy) feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some (brazen modesty, betrayal) feel forced. The length suits the premise, though depth is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
