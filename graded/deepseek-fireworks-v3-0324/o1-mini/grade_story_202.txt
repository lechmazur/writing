<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's dual nature as a careful poisoner and his innocently guilty demeanor are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation to test gravity is unique but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The scavenger hunt method is inventive, though the gravity-testing climax feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The found object museum and dusty starlight atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. The skateboarding contrast is a striking but underutilized detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the rapier) and sensory details (dust swirling) enrich the narrative. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Elias's code of instinct is a standout concept, though its execution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. The brevity works, but the gravity theme could be more fully integrated.</comment>
