<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ivy's apathetic devotion is clear, but her sudden shift to curiosity feels slightly abrupt. The sentient houseplant concept is unique but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The drive-in discovery is intriguing, but the pacing feels rushed in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's eerie mood. Sensory details are strong but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (bookmark, manuscripts) are effective, but the emotional impact is muted by Ivy's apathy. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high with the sentient houseplant, but some phrasing feels overly formal. The narrative avoids clich√©s but could lean further into subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but the elements sometimes feel imposed rather than organic. The length suits the premise, but the thematic depth is surface-level.</comment>
