<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'nondescript' nature slightly limits depth. Their analytical innovation is well-integrated into actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The rain-scent decryption method is inventive but slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (rain scent, tower desolation) enhancing mood. Setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rain, tower) and subtext (justice delayed). Ending is purposeful, though the relic's introduction feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some tropes (mythic relic, lone seeker). Rain-scent method is fresh but risks gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the relic subplot slightly distracts. Style is purposeful, though brevity limits thematic exploration.</comment>
