<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his peaceful stance with a deeper quest for knowledge. His transformation from boredom to determination is well-executed, though his "coy malevolence" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions. The connection between the shadowbirds and ley lines feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the orchard and storms enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the craft fairs could be more integrated into the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (rusty nail, shadowbirds) is effective, and the ending is satisfying. However, the "coy malevolence" tone isn't fully realized, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. Eliot's internal conflict is nuanced, though the prose occasionally leans toward over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the story lingers. The length feels deliberate, but the neighborhood watch concept could be more central.</comment>
