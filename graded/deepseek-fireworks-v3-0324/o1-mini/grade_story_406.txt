<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her coy spy persona and desire for disguise mastery. The loose button as a tool adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. The temporal shift is cleverly integrated, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (simmering brews, dancing shadows). The brewery setting enhances the magical tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance ("mended fences") and emotional payoff. Symbolism (button, time reversal) is effective, though some metaphors verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the time-manipulation twist, but "diabolically benevolent" feels underutilized. Avoids clich√©s but leans slightly into spy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering sense of reconciliation and magic.</comment>
