<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his polite demeanor with bandit-like ambition. His silent eloquence and resilience are well-portrayed, though his "polite bandit" duality could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Arlo's quest, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions. The harp's role in deciphering the chip feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The electronic wilderness refuge is vividly rendered, blending nature and circuitry to mirror Arlo's turmoil. Sensory details (hologram tree, distorted harp) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the ending is purposeful. However, the theme of time mastery could be more subtly woven into the subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and showcases originality, though some phrases ("proud humility") verge on overly poetic. The electronic wilderness concept is fresh and memorable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the classroom timeframe slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
