<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marla's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "blatantly secretive" nature feels slightly contradictory. Her actions align well with her goals, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The crayon-drawn map discovery is inventive, but the life-changing kiss feels abrupt for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary and library are evocatively rendered, with strong sensory details. The "edgy nostalgia" tone enhances the atmosphere, though the bird sanctuary's relevance to the spice trade is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (dried flower, crayon sketches) is effective, and the theme of merging past/future is compelling. The ending is purposeful, but the kiss's emotional weight could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (enigmatic archivist, lost technologies). The prose avoids purple tendencies, though some metaphors feel safe.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the kiss's timing slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
