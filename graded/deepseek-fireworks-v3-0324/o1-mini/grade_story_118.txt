<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's motivation is clear but her "uniformly peculiar" attribute feels underdeveloped. The scuffed phone charger plug as a symbol is intriguing but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the method of wax-draining feels overly abstract. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the pacing is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with effective sensory immersion. The setting enhances the action, though the "merry bitterness" tone is inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract method. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrases feel formulaic ("haunting melody," "ephemeral in reality"). The hive-mind therapist's reasoning lacks human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lingering thought is present but not deeply compelling.</comment>
