<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eldric's grumpy exterior and vulnerability are well-balanced, but his motivation to quell inner turmoil through the sand mandala could be more explicitly tied to his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the connection between the tube and the mandala feels underdeveloped. The resolution is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mystical atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Eldric's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sand mandala, tube) and subtext. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overused ("void he yearned to fill").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("shattered memories," "wounded spirit"). Nuanced emotion, but some descriptions lack freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the word limit slightly hampers deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of hope and transformation.</comment>
