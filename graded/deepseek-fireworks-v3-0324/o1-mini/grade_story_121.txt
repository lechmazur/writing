<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "shifty" nature feels underdeveloped. His spontaneous actions align well with his attribute, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the surreal circus caravans feel abruptly introduced. Pacing is uneven, with some rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in and twilight atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are strong, though the parole hearing's connection to the setting is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (microscope, caravans) is effective, but the theme of failure is overstated. The ending is satisfying but leans toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional beats and some generic phrasing. The surreal elements feel fresh but occasionally forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brevity works, though some ideas feel underexplored.</comment>
