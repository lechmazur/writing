<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mage's "loyally peculiar" nature is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the resolution feels abrupt. The "clash" drives tension well, though the fog method is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lunar base and "charred serenity" create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. The doormat's symbolism is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and mood, but the theme of "fearless future" lacks depth. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on vague descriptors ("ephemeral silhouettes"). Some phrases feel overly poetic without substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce decently, but the lunar base feels underdeveloped. The brevity works, though the fog method detracts.</comment>
