<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation is clear and consistent, with her intellect and quiet demeanor driving her actions. The porcelain doll effectively symbolizes her mission, though her "brainy observer" trait could be more dynamically integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the connection between faster-than-light travel and her street art feels underexplored. The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and Amelia's actions. Sensory details are evocative, though the futuristic timeframe could be more seamlessly woven into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with the doll and ephemeral art enriching the theme. The writing style is elegant, though some metaphors verge on overused. Emotional resonance is achieved through atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally relies on familiar tropes (solitary seeker, lost civilizations). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could benefit from more nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering impression, though the futuristic aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
