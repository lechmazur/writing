<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eldric's underachieving mage trait is clear, but his motivation to reclaim heritage feels somewhat forced. His bored excitement is intriguing but inconsistently explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The doll head's magic and farmland sale are compelling, but the space station connection lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland create a unique atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse. The doll head's blinking eyes are a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (doll head, farmland) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending resolves too neatly for the setup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the space station/farmland blend, but some phrasing feels AI-generic ("bored excitement," "exceptionally usual").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively uses assigned elements, but the space station feels underutilized. The length suits the arc, though deeper themes are hinted at, not explored.</comment>
