<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's alien identity and teacher persona are well-integrated, but her "righteously flawed" nature could be more deeply explored to align with her fears and mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the puzzle tile, but the connection between the organ and her mission feels slightly forced, weakening the cause-and-effect flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is vividly rendered, and the organ's reverberations enhance the atmosphere, though the timeframe of "throughout concerts" lacks specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is strong, with effective symbolism, but the theme of "breaking free from fear" could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise is original, but some phrases verge on flowery, and the alien-teacher dynamic risks feeling tropey without deeper subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though the brevity occasionally limits emotional depth. The ending resonates but could linger more.</comment>
