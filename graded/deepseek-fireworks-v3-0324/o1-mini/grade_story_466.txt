<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's cunning and morally ambiguous nature is well-established, but his motivation to "corner an elusive destiny" feels somewhat abstract and could be more concretely tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. The connection between grocery shopping and the tower is abrupt but intriguing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with the smoke signal tower and vintage seed packets creating a haunting, mysterious mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (seeds as coded maps) and its exploration of preservation vs. exploitation add depth. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though the "gentle chaos" tone is inconsistently maintained. The prose is purposeful but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. The brevity works in its favor, leaving room for reflection on hidden histories.</comment>
