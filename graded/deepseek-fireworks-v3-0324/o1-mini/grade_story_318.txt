<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the spoon's animation serving as a clear climax. However, the connection between lullabies and memory preservation could be more explicitly developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The memory crystal library is vividly rendered, and the gloomy cheerfulness of the atmosphere enhances the story's emotional weight. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (spoon as a bridge between memory and existence) is strong, and the ending is satisfying. Some metaphors verge on overused ("precipice of oblivion").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope. The brevity works in its favor, though some concepts could be explored more deeply.</comment>
