<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's transformation from disinterested to vibrant is compelling, but his initial passivity feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the menagerie's introduction could be smoother. The arc is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The menagerie's atmosphere is vividly rendered, though the "static" map's connection to the setting could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance, but the witch's gift feels abrupt. The ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though "brimming cup" leans slightly clich√©. Nuanced handling of Eliot's growth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the volunteer stints feel tacked on. The length suits the story's ambition.</comment>
