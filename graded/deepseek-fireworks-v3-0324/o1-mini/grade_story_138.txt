<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear but his "hollow recklessness" feels underdeveloped. The drone's symbolism is strong, but his nobility is barely explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The reassembly of ticket stubs as a method to "fortify" is inventive, though the lab's role feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lab's chaotic atmosphere is vivid, but its connection to "spontaneous combustion" is underutilized. Sensory details (burning wires, humming drone) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (drone, stubs) and subtext, but the theme of "candor in small moments" is overstated. Ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality falters with clich√©s ("veneer of his past"). The drone and lab are fresh, but the noble's arc feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the lab and "hollow recklessness" tone clash. The story lingers, but some choices feel forced.</comment>
