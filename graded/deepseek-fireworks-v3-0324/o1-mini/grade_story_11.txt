<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evelyn's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "flighty" nature feels underdeveloped. Her serene anger and meticulous work create an intriguing contrast, though her distinct voice is somewhat muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The linearization of the map drives the story effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with candle-lit serenity contrasting the secret society's mystique. Sensory details like the grease-stained patch enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (map, paintings) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise, but phrases like "serene anger" and "flicker of unity" verge on cliché. The mechanic’s patch is a fresh detail, though the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate. The brevity works, but deeper exploration of Evelyn's flightiness would elevate it.</comment>
