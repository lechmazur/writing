<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear but her "carefully careless" nature feels underdeveloped. The dog walker role adds uniqueness but isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the transition from blood drive to mansion feels abrupt. Pacing is managed well within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, especially the "loud silence" and botanical details. The mansion setting enhances the eerie mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism, but the emotional resonance is slightly muted. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (haunted mansion, silent agreements). Sensory details are vivid but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some feel underutilized. The storyâ€™s brevity works, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
