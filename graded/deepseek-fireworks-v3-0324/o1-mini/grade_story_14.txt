<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elliot's motivation is clear but his naivety feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his gamble-driven nature, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the lectures and Elliot's final gamble feels rushed. Pacing suffers slightly under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tidal station and candlelit dinners create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., flickering flames) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle mold as hope) is strong, but the ending's emotional impact is diluted by abrupt resolution. Theme of risk vs. reward is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable gambler tropes. Some metaphors (e.g., "spark") feel overused. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its length. The candle mold and station are well-utilized, but lectures and bargains lack integration.</comment>
