<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the yarn's unraveling, though the spa's role in the political intrigue feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on some tropes (redemption arc, hidden heir). The "freed by kindness" theme is heartfelt but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, though the spa's whimsy and the political stakes could harmonize better.</comment>
