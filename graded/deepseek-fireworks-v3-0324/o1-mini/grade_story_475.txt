<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's detachment is clear, but his motivation to escape feels somewhat generic. The photo frame adds depth, but his transition lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolic action (detaching the frame). The lullaby method is intriguing but underdeveloped in driving the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The circus tent and analog-to-digital transition create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "tattered stripes," "hauntingly bright moon") are strong but occasionally overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (frame as a gateway) is effective, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the dystopian setup. Literary devices are polished but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (dystopian escape, coded songs). Some phrases ("feral elegance") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lullaby concept could be expanded for greater impact.</comment>
