<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'off-grid survivalist baron' trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his curiosity and isolation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in transitions. The raft's moment is strong, but the silent communication with the raven could be better integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances Elowen's internal struggle. Sensory details are evocative but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (empty bottle, reflections) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the raven's role could be deepened for greater emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly ornate, but the voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the raft sequence feels slightly abrupt. The brevity works in its favor, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
