<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethan's rashness is underdeveloped; his motivation for seeking solace is clear but lacks depth in how it drives his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric buildup; the chance encounter feels abrupt, and the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the fortress and caverns occasionally overshadow character dynamics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (postcards, cosmos), but emotional resonance is muted by overly poetic prose. The ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into mystical clich√©s; some phrases feel repetitive ("mystical reality," "dawn of awareness").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its word limit; the theme of interconnectedness is compelling but underexplored.</comment>
