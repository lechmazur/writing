<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "uncommonly typical" attribute feels underdeveloped and somewhat contradictory to her scholarly dedication.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the wire coil's action, but the temporal mechanics and climax feel slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The capsule hotel and temporal echoes create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "earthbound flight" tone occasionally clashes with the grounded setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the density of elements strains the brevity. Leaves a lingering question about legacy vs. temporal disruption.</comment>
