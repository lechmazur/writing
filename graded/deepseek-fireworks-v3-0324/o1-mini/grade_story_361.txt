<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his mechanical skills with cultural preservation. His dual life adds depth, though his "mild-mannered trapper" origin feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eli's nightly emulation, but the transition from diner worker to guardian feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and schoolhouse are vividly rendered, enhancing the theme of blending eras. Sensory details (neon lights, chalk equations) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, equations) and subtext (cultural preservation) are effective. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of tech and tradition, avoiding clich√©s. The dice as a tool of fate and the schoolhouse sanctuary feel fresh. Minor over-reliance on "organized disorder."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the diner and schoolhouse serving distinct roles. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering theme of resilience.</comment>
