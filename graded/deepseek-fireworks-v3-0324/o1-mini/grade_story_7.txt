<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldric's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "expectantly resigned" attribute could be more deeply explored to reveal greater emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The star paths method feels underdeveloped as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The nectar facility and ethereal lights enhance the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cane, dolls) and subtext, but the "chorus of healing" concept could be more deeply woven into the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("ethereal grit") verge on overused. The dolls and cane feel fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the star paths and nectar facility could be more organically integrated into the theme.</comment>
