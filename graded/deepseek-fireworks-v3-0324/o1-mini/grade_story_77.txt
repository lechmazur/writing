<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empathy is well-integrated, shaping her actions and motivations clearly. Her connection to the starfish and marionette reveals depth, though her "hidden" attribute could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's reassembly of the marionette, but the space pirate hideout feels underutilized. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The asteroid setting is evocative but lacks deeper integration with the marionette's symbolism. Sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and symbolism (marionette, starfish). Ending is satisfying, though "drowsy enthusiasm" tone occasionally clashes with the weighty themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but "mountain wisdom" feels tacked on. Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the hideout and journal framing could be tighter. Leaves a lingering emotional impact despite minor inconsistencies.</comment>
