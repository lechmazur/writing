<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The swordsman's motivation is clear but lacks deeper emotional nuance. His actions align with his quest, but his personality feels somewhat archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The poetic trail and box's role are logical, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details. The laboratory and garden contrast effectively, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the box, shifting sands) are used well. The theme of change is explored thoughtfully, though the ending could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is present but leans on familiar tropes (solemn swordsman, secret garden). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering impression but could benefit from more thematic depth.</comment>
