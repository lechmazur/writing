<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's loyalty and wanderer traits are clear, but Luna's "pleasantly troublesome" nature feels underdeveloped. Their motivations align with the theme but lack deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to crisis and resolution. The storm's suddenness slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's ethereal mood. Sensory details immerse the reader, though the storm's impact could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scrimshaw, dance) and subtext about art's resilience. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (art as salvation). Some phrasing feels overly ornate ("gentle sharpness"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers but could delve deeper into the consciousness-tracking premise.</comment>
