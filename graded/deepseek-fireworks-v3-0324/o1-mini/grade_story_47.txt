<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" is evocatively rendered, enhancing the story's haunting atmosphere, but the connection to auditions could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("graceless beauty," "fearless laugh"). Nuanced emotion saves it from feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the auditions timeframe feels underutilized. The ending lingers effectively, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
