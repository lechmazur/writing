<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Julian's brooding nature and artistic sensitivity are well-integrated, but his motivation to escape servitude could be more deeply explored to align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds tension effectively, though the method of escape via dust feels slightly abrupt. The arc is clear but could benefit from tighter cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details like the hum of machinery and dust in sunlight enhancing the mood. The setting and tone complement each other well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glasses, dust) and subtext, but the emotional impact could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but leans slightly toward the abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally slips into stated feelings. Avoids clich√©s but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some moments could be more impactful.</comment>
