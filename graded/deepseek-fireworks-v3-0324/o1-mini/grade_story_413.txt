<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alistair's listlessness and naively sophisticated curiosity are clear, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt. The scarf's symbolism is strong, but his motivation could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the pacing is uneven—some moments linger while others rush. The maze's role is compelling, but the resolution feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted plain and corn maze create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like the whispering winds and fluttering scarf enhance immersion, though the timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (scarf, maze) and subtext (intention, connection) are effective, but some metaphors verge on cliché. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (haunted settings, transformative encounters). Some phrasing feels overly ornate, detracting from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story occasionally feels constrained by them. The brevity works, though deeper thematic exploration would elevate it.</comment>
