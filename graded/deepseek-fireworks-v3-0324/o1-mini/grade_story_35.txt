<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her quiet demeanor and gardening background enriching her emotional journey. The embroidered purse serves as a powerful symbol of her connection to lost emotions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from longing to understanding. However, the silent retreat method feels slightly underdeveloped in driving the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Universal Translation Center and bird calls create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lanterns, embroidery patterns) enhance the mood and support Elara's introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (purse, garden) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though the retreat's mechanics could be sharper.</comment>
