<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's guiltily innocent demeanor and motivation to heal through decoding diaries are well-developed, but his wilderness guide background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the sunken ballroom and the blanket's diaries feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater ballroom and bioluminescent flora create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "morning coffee ritual" clashes tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (metal ring, blanket) and emotional depth, but the manic clarity tone occasionally disrupts the introspective mood.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but some phrases ("manic clarity," "equalizing fragmented memories") verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the story's surrealism risks overshadowing its emotional core. The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>
