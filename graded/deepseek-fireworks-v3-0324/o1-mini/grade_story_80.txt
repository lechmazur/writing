<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evelyn's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration of how it shapes her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the transition from logs to roller coaster feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details, though the roller coaster's "eroding" could be more vividly described.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (haunted inns, ancient riddles). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. The elements serve the story well.</comment>
