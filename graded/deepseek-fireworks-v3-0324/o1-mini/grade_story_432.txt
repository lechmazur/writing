<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. His death wish and role as a poison taster are compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the radio psychics and the ritual feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and ice sculpture create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the mood, though the radio feels slightly out of place.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, ice) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be sharper. Literary devices are effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of quiet tragedy.</comment>
