<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's faintheartedness and determination are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The ruler's symbolic use is effective but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing is unevenâ€”some moments linger while others feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chamber and tapestry create a rich atmosphere, but the dog-walking contrast, while intriguing, isn't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and theme, but the emotional impact is muted by occasional telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (secret societies, hidden truths). The ruler's mundanity is a fresh touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the ending's enlightenment feels slightly unearned. The length suits the story well.</comment>
