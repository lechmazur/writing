<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desmond's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "brazen raider" trait feels underutilized. The charcoal ritual adds depth, but his impulsively thoughtful nature could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The connection between betrayal and the mission to warn Dr. Elara works, though pacing suffers in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater lab setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The tone of "fractured grace" is well-executed, enhancing the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (charcoal) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but some dialogue feels stiff. Theme of resilience vs. betrayal shines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but minor clich√©s linger (e.g., "flicker of trust"). The charcoal ritual feels fresh, though the "genius in isolation" trope is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though some elements could mesh tighter.</comment>
