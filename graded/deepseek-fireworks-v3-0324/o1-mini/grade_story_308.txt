<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's bashful nature and fierce passion are well-balanced, but his role as an executioner feels underdeveloped and incongruous with the yoga setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable, with the keychain serving as a weak catalyst for tension. The pacing is smooth but lacks urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and festival atmosphere are vividly rendered, though the "soothing tides" concept is overused without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (keychain, dance) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted by repetitive phrasing. The ending is satisfying but not profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from clich√©s ("soothing tides," "benign ferocity"). The executioner twist feels forced, and the prose occasionally veers into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story leans too heavily on assigned prompts rather than organic storytelling. The length feels restrictive.</comment>
