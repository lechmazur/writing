<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sir Cedric and Elara are well-defined with clear, consistent motivations. Their traits (disciplined knight, rebellious scholar) drive their actions and interactions effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the "scoreboard reset" hook feels underutilized. The journey to verify the shell's power forms a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous swamp is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the ethereal tone and mirroring the characters' converging destinies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shell, swamp) and subtext (legends as truth). The ending is purposeful, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional over-reliance on "luminous" and "converging destinies" risks clich√©. Dialogue and character nuance stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the scoreboard motif could be tighter.</comment>
