<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rajiv's dual nature as a city planner and doomsday prepper is compelling, but his motivation to escape self-imposed chains could be more deeply explored. His actions align with his traits, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Rajiv's study of constellations, but the handshake moment feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The atmosphere supports Rajiv's quest beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (temple as sanctuary, broken constellations as keys). Some phrases feel overly formal. Nuance in emotion is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the thematic depth could be more pronounced.</comment>
