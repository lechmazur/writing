<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's frazzled yet resilient nature is well-developed, and her motivation to document social changes is clear and consistent. Her use of the vintage ink pot reveals depth, though her "strongly weak" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Mira's levitation, but the connection between "between games" and the rest of the narrative feels underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village is evocatively rendered, and the blood-red moon enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The ink pot and setting are meaningfully linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance and use of symbolism (ink pot, courage strands) are strong. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of social change could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the style avoids clich√©s. The tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite its brevity, and elements serve the narrative well. The length is deliberate, though a lingering thought could be more pronounced.</comment>
