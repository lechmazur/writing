<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prophet's ambivalence and "happily sad" state are compelling, but their motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" feels slightly abstract. Their actions align with their traits, but deeper introspection could strengthen their voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the "jigsaw puzzle edges" method feels underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the cosmic stakes could be more grounded in the lunar setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar colony and Earthlight create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (marbles shimmering, machinery humming) are evocative, but the setting could interact more dynamically with the prophet's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (marbles, puzzle edges) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional impact of the "final oath" could be deeper. Writing style enhances the story's ethereal quality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The "bashful arrogance" tone is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Nuanced handling of melancholy and joy elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic wonder. A few more concrete details could solidify its impact.</comment>
