<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and aligned with traits, but Eli's "sleepy nomad" attribute feels underutilized. Mira's arrogance and redemption arc are well-handled.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in places. The disguise room's introduction feels abrupt, though the thematic arc is resolved effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with strong sensory details (whispering pines, moss-covered hillside), but the disguise room's fantasy practicality clashes slightly with the forest's natural tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (barbells reforged) and subtext. Ending is satisfying, though some dialogue lacks natural flow. Theme of humility is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is evident in blending spiritual materialism with masquerade, but some phrases ("fantasy practicality") feel forced. Emotional resonance is nuanced but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the disguise room feels like a narrative detour. Story lingers thematically but suffers from minor pacing issues.</comment>
