<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evelyn's motivation is clear and consistent, but her 'skewed visionary' trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her goal, but her distinct voice is muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The hieroglyphs as a method feel abrupt, and the silent revolution is underutilized. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temporal anomaly study is evocative, but the 'silent revolution' timeframe lacks integration. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are effective, and the theme of preservation is clear. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict is subtle to the point of being faint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The story avoids clich√©s, though the 'mundane miracles' tone feels inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but strained by the elements. The length feels like a limitation, not a choice. Leaves a lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
