<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's rebellious nature and motivation to prime her heart for wonder are clear, but her "sadly joyful" expression feels somewhat forced and could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the phone call serving as a strong turning point, though the haunted house setting could be more integral to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the ephemeral gloom enhances the mood, though the amusement park's decay could be more thematically tied to Margot's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the knife, the phone) and emotional resonance, but the theme of adaptation could be more subtly woven into the narrative rather than explicitly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("bittersweet joy," "haunting echoes"), and the tone occasionally slips into predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements, though the ending's warmth slightly clashes with the earlier gloom.</comment>
