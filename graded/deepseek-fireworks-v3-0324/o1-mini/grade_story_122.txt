<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is clear but his internal conflict could be deeper. His "patiently frantic" attribute is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the prism method, though the pacing feels slightly rushed in the climax. The arc is complete but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sky burial site and cybernetic vision create a striking, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lightning, prism light) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bridle, prism) and thematic depth, but the euphoric agitation tone occasionally overpowers subtlety. Ending is resonant but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original cyber-fantasy blend, though some phrases ("euphoric agitation") verge on overwrought. Avoids clich√©s but risks stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the word limit strains thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering question about illusion vs. control.</comment>
