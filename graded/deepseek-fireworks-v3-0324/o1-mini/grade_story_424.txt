<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ethan's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His "mild zealot" nature is subtly but effectively portrayed through his meticulous rituals and academic dedication.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the revelation. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (amber lamps, storm) enhancing atmosphere. The lab's rustic refinement contrasts beautifully with the chaotic equations, reinforcing theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (money as keys, scars as marks of survival) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of sacrifice and legacy feels fresh, though some metaphors verge on generic ("weight of ancestral decisions").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering thought about sacrifice as continuity, though the lab's role could be sharper.</comment>
