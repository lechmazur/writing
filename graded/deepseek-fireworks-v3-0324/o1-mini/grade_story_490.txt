<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his 'fading caretaker' role feels underdeveloped. His curiosity is compelling but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The hacking of archives feels abrupt, and the transition from duty to exploration lacks smoothness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with strong sensory details (lavender, salty air) enhancing the desolate, mystical mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (lavender as talisman) is effective, but the ending feels ambiguous rather than purposeful. Literary devices are overused in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The tone of "enthusiastic apathy" is intriguing but inconsistently executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by its elements. The length suits the premise, though some ideas needed more room to breathe.</comment>
