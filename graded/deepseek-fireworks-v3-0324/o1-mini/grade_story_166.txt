<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghostly caretaker's solemnly silly demeanor and unconventional methods create a distinct, memorable character. Motivation is clear and consistent, though slightly whimsical for high literary standards.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the straw's role, but the forbidden expedition logs feel underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams are vividly rendered, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. Sensory details (crystalline branches, spectral moonlight) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story evokes wonder and employs strong symbolism (straw as fate-weaver). Ending is satisfying, but some themes (balance, communication) could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "solemnly silly" tone risks undermining gravitas. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "bridge of threads") stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of harmony, though the straw's centrality borders on gimmicky.</comment>
