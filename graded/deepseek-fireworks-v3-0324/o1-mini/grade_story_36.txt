<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's calm doomsayer persona is compelling, but his motivation to "slam a door on the gods of stagnation" feels slightly abstract. His connection to the skateboard is vivid, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed in its resolution. The train whistle as a metronome is a strong touch, but the steampunk elements could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and dawn setting are richly detailed, creating a strong atmosphere. The skateboard's contrast with the setting is effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (skateboard as resilience) and subtext (loss of innocence vs. progress) are well-handled. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "placid ferocity" feels slightly forced. The steampunk-meets-skateboard concept is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic depth. The story lingers in the mind, though.</comment>
