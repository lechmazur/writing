<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldric's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "hauntingly cheerful" demeanor effectively masking deeper hopes. His use of the cracked lens as a symbol of imperfection transformed into magic is a strong character beat.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the "between innings" timeframe feels slightly forced. The connection between Eldric's invention and his colleagues' skepticism is logical and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with the station's utilitarian design contrasting beautifully with the celestial spectacle. Sensory details (e.g., the projector's hum, shimmering air) enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the ending is purposeful. However, the theme of science vs. magic could be explored with more depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases ("tumultuous spirit") edge toward flowery. The cracked lens as a motif is fresh and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder, suggesting depth.</comment>
