<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his roguish charm with a deeper purpose. His cautious nature adds nuance, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between driftwood carvings and revolution feels slightly forced. The arc is satisfying but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The bioluminescent corals and forgotten shore are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (e.g., the piano) and subtext, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The theme of collective enlightenment is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (the inspirational minstrel). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be more daring in style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the underwater setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
