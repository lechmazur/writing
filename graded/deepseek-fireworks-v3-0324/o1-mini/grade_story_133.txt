<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's jaded nature and transformation are clear, but Lila's enigmatic traits feel underdeveloped. The gloves' role in his motivation is strong, though her sudden reveal lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the throne's introduction feels abrupt. The pottery class encounter is a clever catalyst but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard's labyrinthine setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing its mystical atmosphere. The colonial rooftops add a unique contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, throne) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (hidden throne, enigmatic artist). The gloves and orchard feel fresh, but Lila's twist is predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the throne's significance could be deeper. The brevity suits the fable-like tone.</comment>
