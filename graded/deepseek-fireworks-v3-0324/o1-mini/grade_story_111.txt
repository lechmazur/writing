<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his alchemical past and internal conflict well-integrated. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in resolving his dilemma. The pond's role as a catalyst is effective but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The secret dog park and brewing season create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (fog, moss, moonlight) enhance mood, though the park's connection to alchemy could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ribbon, pond) is well-executed, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional impact is occasionally undermined by telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases verge on flowery, and the grief/hope balance occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering question about faith, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
