<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, but his "strictly casual" attribute feels underdeveloped. His telekinetic powers and reactions to the chopstick wrapper reveal depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed. The connection between the beginning and end is strong, though some cause-and-effect relationships could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival booth and fading evening light create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (peeling paint, rusted trinkets) enhance the mood, and the setting meaningfully supports the story's concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (chopstick wrapper) and evokes emotional resonance. The theme of knowledge's price is explored with depth, though the ending could feel more purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases verge on overly flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the tone occasionally wavers between grandiose and subtle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creatively combines elements. The brief length works, but some stylistic choices slightly hinder clarity. It leaves a lingering thought, suggesting depth.</comment>
