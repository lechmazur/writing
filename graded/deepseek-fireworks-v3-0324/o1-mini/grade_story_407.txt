<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'unluckiness' feels underdeveloped. The sextant adds depth, but his cosmic obsession could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The shortcut-to-lizard-people transition is abrupt, though the cosmic-botanical connection is intriguing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underground city is vividly rendered, and the bioluminescent flora enhances atmosphere. The "systematically chaotic" lightning is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (sextant, bitter honey) and thematic depth, but the dialogue with the lizard elder lacks natural flow. Ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (bitter honey), though the lizard people trope risks clich√©. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the word limit strains the narrative. The sextant and plant study are creatively integrated, leaving a lingering curiosity.</comment>
