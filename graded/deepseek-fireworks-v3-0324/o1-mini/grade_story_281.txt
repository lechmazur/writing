<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jasper's transformation is compelling, but his initial bafflement feels slightly underdeveloped. His poetic engagement with the dummy is a strong, unique motivator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with poetry as the driving force. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "appointments" framing is vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and dummy create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (flickering light, steel walls) enhance the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dummy as bridge), evocative language, and a resonant theme of reinvention. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "scorching poise" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
