<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's spinelessness is subtly portrayed but his motivation to understand flowers is clear and consistent. His actions align with his reverent yet fragile nature, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly meandering. The connection between beginning and end is present but could be tighter. Pacing is deliberate but risks losing momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. Atmosphere deeply supports the theme of blurred boundaries, though the rain showers could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (owls, tears) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict (toxic decay vs. reverence) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly floral, but the emotional nuance and fresh metaphors stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, though the word limit slightly strains the depth of exploration. Leaves a lingering melancholy.</comment>
