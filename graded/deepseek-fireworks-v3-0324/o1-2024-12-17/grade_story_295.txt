<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Othin's jovial yet reluctantly bold nature is well-established, but his motivation to "dethrone doubt" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the treasure hunt feels underdeveloped. The vow's resolution is satisfying, though the transition from doubt to clarity could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the witch's mystique. The "elegant mayhem" motif is striking but slightly overused in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (telescope, time capsule) and subtext about relinquishing burdens. The ending resonates, though the theme of doubt could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in blending cosmic and earthy motifs, but "withering vow" edges toward clich√©. The telescope and time capsule are fresh, though the witch feels somewhat archetypal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the garden and vow serving the story organically. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
