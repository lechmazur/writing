<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Roderic's ambition and loyalty are well-defined, driving his actions consistently. His use of the straw as a tool reveals ingenuity, though his brewer background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect progression. The deciphering of bruises and discovery of performers create a satisfying arc, though the transition to the hidden passage is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's eerie, industrial atmosphere. Sensory details (hissing machinery, frigid warehouse) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance (preservation, unity) and evocative symbolism (bruises as lost paths). The ending is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "bruises dotted the yellowed surface"). Minor AI-like phrasing in descriptions, but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, inventive narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth and lingering questions.</comment>
