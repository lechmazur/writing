<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the narrative with emotional weight. His theoretically creative mind is well-integrated into his actions, though his distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from regret to redemption. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the frost method feels slightly abrupt in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hidden library and waterfall setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the mystical tone. Sensory details (water, moss, torchlight) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>
