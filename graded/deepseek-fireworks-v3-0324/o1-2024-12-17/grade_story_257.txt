<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Talia's motivation is clear and consistent, with her intellectual curiosity and longing for change driving her actions. Her "voice" is distinct, though her overqualification could be more explicitly tied to her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from contemplation to action feels slightly rushed. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (fireflies, lanterns) enhancing the mood. The setting supports Talia's introspection and contrasts with her mundane labor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of postcards, fireflies) are effective, and the theme of reinvention is compelling. The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper into the elders' resistance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in Talia's method of reinvention, though some phrases ("bruised exhilaration") verge on overused. Emotional nuance is strong, avoiding clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering question about societal change, suggesting depth.</comment>
