<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The smuggler's motivation is clear but his "rationally emotional" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his reckless nature, but deeper introspection is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the synchronized watch alarms feel contrived as a method. The arc is clear but leans on atmospheric tension over structural precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”haunting sensory details elevate the setting. The funhouse mirrors the character's fractured psyche, though the "map tears" concept isn't fully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with vivid imagery and subtext, but the ending's emotional payoff is muted. The theme of desperate belonging is poignant but slightly overshadowed by style.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in tone and setting, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The "jubilant despair" dichotomy feels forced at times, undermining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the smuggler's archetype is underutilized. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering unease but not profundity.</comment>
