<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's dry-tongued nature and gorgeously awkward posture are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to escape the "prison of the self" feels slightly abstract. His actions with the voicemails reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the voicemails, but the resolution feels rushed. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom hall and stained glass prism create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (moonlight, fungal pillars) immerse the reader, though the "crisp languor" tone occasionally overpowers the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cloak of doubt, prism) and emotional resonance stand out. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overworked. Theme of authenticity is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal setting and voicemail device, but phrases like "calcified hope" edge toward clich√©. Nuanced emotion saves it from feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the mushroom hall feels slightly gimmicky. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of renewal.</comment>
