<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "eager lookout" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his desire for connection, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The sewing box discovery drives the narrative effectively, though the poltergeist analysis feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The villa's reimagined setting enhances the story's mood, though the "technically organic" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of digital-age connection could be deeper.</comment>
