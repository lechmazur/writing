<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ranor's amiable yet obsessed nature is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "peaceful anger" adds depth, though his gambler persona feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the ledger's secrets, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds are vividly atmospheric, enhancing the mystical tone. Sensory details (e.g., "shimmering creatures," "fading ink") immerse the reader, though the charity drives feel marginally disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (petals, fireflies) and subtext (unbecoming as rebirth). The ending is purposeful, but the theme of "peaceful anger" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("hydrolyze of old attachments") verge on overly ornate. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with creative integration of the ledger and unbecoming. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of unresolved destiny.</comment>
