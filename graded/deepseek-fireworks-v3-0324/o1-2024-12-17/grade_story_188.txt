<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hida's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past as a lawman and desire for redemption well-integrated. His use of the spectacles reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the letter, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective, though the connection between seed planting and the castle's spirits could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The castle's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The corroded rapture tone complements Hida's anguish, though the seed planting motif feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (spectacles, fragments) is potent, and the ending is purposeful. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown, and the theme of redemption could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. Hida's emotional nuance is strong, though Hanako's role leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the seed planting timeframe could be more integral to the narrative.</comment>
