<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The noble's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "mysteriously obvious lineage" feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his quest for truth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the climax (gas bursting into sparks) feels abrupt. The ticket stub method is unique but slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (sulfuric stench, scorch marks). The hummingbird drone adds a futuristic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ticket stubs, illusions) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases ("hollow recklessness") verge on overwrought. The noble's voice avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the lab setting feels slightly forced. The story lingers intellectually, if not viscerally.</comment>
