<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Adelina's secretive nature and prodigal past are well-integrated, but her "angrily peaceful" attribute feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; some transitions between actions (e.g., hacking playlists to herbal remedies) lack smoothness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, though the ghost train's connection to folk medicines could be more organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but "hacking playlists" clashes with the antiquated tone; some metaphors verge on overused (e.g., "hidden shards of potential").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the marathon training subplot feels tangential. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>
