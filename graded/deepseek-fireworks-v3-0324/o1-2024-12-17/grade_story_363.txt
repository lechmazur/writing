<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The miner's grief and determination are vividly portrayed, but "passionately indifferent" feels slightly contradictory and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect, though the secret society's role could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with the silent bell and haunted tunnels amplifying the miner's sorrow and purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the bell, nightmares) and subtext, though the "poignant levity" tone is inconsistently realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, but minor AI-like phrasing ("passionately indifferent") and over-reliance on the bell's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with the miner's mission and grief elegantly intertwined. The word limit feels deliberate.</comment>
