<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his supernatural gift and family conflict. His "joyfully melancholic" nature is vividly portrayed, though his "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The connection between the amber, ghosts, and family tradition is compelling but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with the abandoned carnival and amber relic enhancing the ghostly, introspective mood. Sensory details are strong, though the "half-written letter" timeframe is less immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (amber, targets) and emotional depth. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused. Subtext about tradition vs. rebellion is well-handled.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (amber as trapped spirit). Some phrases lean flowery, but the voice avoids clich√©. Emotional nuance is strong, though the ghost-whisperer trope is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the carnival and amber enriching the theme. The brevity feels intentional, though the ghostly whispers could be more integrated.</comment>
