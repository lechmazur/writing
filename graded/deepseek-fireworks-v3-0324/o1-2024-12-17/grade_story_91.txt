<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his past as an escaped experiment with his gentle, revolutionary aspirations. His fedora adds depth, hinting at a troubled history without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between his actions and the "quiet tuning" concept is logical but could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with the weather station and ghost stories enhancing the eerie yet hopeful tone. Sensory details (mechanical hum, shifting shadows) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fedora, cloud shadows) and subtext (nature vs. machinery). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The lab experiment twist and "quiet tuning" concept feel fresh. Nuanced handling of emotion, though some descriptors verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. The brevity feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
