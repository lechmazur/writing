<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering advisor's guidance is intriguing but lacks deeper personal motivation or distinct voice. The protagonist's connection to the driftwood is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a dreamlike coherence, but the time-dilated logic feels abstract. The ending's resolution is poetic but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and time-dilated zone create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rust, starlight grass) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (coin, driftwood) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of empathy is resonant, though the advisor's urgency feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its surreal blend of elements, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The futuristic nostalgia tone is fresh but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves its elements, leaving a lingering, poetic impression. The brevity feels deliberate, though some ideas beg deeper exploration.</comment>
