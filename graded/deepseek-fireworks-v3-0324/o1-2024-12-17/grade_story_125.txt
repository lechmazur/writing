<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Camus's motivation is clear but his "exceptionally usual" magic feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The misdelivered packages drive the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland setting create a vivid, atmospheric contrast. Sensory details like flickering consoles and wheat fields enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and uses symbolism (doll head, crystal) well. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (lost heritage, hidden power). The tone is consistent, though some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity works, but the storyâ€™s depth feels slightly constrained by word count.</comment>
