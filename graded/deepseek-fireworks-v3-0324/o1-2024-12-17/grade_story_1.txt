<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harold's phobias and stunt double background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his fears, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Harold's quest, but the transition from garage sales to the pyramid feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory details and a haunting tone. The library's gloom complements Harold's journey, though the pyramid's connection to the net could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (net, knots) and a memorable ending. The theme of confronting fear is clear, but some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on flowery. Avoids clich√©s, but the "mundanely spiritual" attribute feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the garage sales timeframe feels underutilized. The story lingers, though some elements could be tighter.</comment>
