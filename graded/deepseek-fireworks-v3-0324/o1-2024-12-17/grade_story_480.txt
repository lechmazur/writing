<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leland's motivation is clear and intriguing, but his "indifferent enthusiasm" feels slightly inconsistent with his deep curiosity and mission-driven actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from the music hall to the mess hall feels abrupt. The grocery receipt's significance could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, though the shift from "music hall" to "mess hall" slightly disrupts immersion. The setting enhances the eerie, clandestine tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's "energy surged" feels abrupt. The theme of digital vs. human connection is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "social media exorcist" concept is inventive, though the tone occasionally wavers between detached and engaged.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the word limit slightly strains the resolution. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of digital ghosts.</comment>
