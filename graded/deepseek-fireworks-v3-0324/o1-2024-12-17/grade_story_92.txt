<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the "dog walker for the ultra-rich" angle adds intrigue but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, though the blood drive encounter feels slightly forced. The silent agreement concept ties the narrative together effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed and immersive, with strong sensory descriptions. The haunted mansion and botanical collection enhance the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storytelling is evocative with strong literary devices, though the ending lacks full resolution. Theme of courage vs. menace is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality is solid but leans on gothic tropes. Some phrases feel overly polished, hinting at AI influence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit slightly hampers deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering unease, suggesting depth.</comment>
