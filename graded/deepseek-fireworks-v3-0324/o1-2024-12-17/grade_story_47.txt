<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elthea's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "eagerly jaded" nature driving her to seek deeper meaning. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "dutiful ward" aspect could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from disillusionment to resolution. However, the cryptic voice notes feel slightly contrived as a plot device, and the chapel discovery could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with the "soundless sanctuary" and dim corridors enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like the worn glove and burning candle are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (glove, candle) and subtext (mortality, authenticity) is strong, though some metaphors verge on overused. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality in its themes, but some phrases ("graceless beauty") feel overly poetic without grounding. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively uses its elements, though the brevity slightly limits thematic depth. It leaves a lingering thought but could benefit from more narrative weight.</comment>
