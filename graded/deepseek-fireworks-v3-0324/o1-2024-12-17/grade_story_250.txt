<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heretic's motivation is clear and intriguing, but his "blunt" nature feels underdeveloped. The teddy bear adds depth, but his actions could better reflect his heresy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The stock ticker method feels forced, but the battle and resolution are effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The library and temple setting enhances the story's tension and mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though some literary devices feel overworked. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (e.g., "forgotten horrors"). The stock ticker and teddy bear clash tonally, hinting at algorithmic stitching.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite eclectic elements. The length feels deliberate, but the stock ticker disrupts the story's momentum.</comment>
