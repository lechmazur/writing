<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harold's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "guiltily innocent" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his motivation, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The connection between the crocheted blanket and the ring feels forced, and pacing suffers in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom is vividly rendered, but the eerie luminescence and coral-encrusted doors overshadow the morning coffee ritual's atmospheric potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (ring, blanket) is effective, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks depth. Theme of reconciliation is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong in concept (encoded blanket, sunken ballroom), but execution leans slightly formulaic. Some metaphors feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its length, though creative thinking is evident.</comment>
