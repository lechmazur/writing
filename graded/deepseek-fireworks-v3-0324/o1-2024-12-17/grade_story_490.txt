<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's fading spirit and methodical randomness are well-developed, but his motivation to "cradle the unknown" feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the transition from apathy to determination could be smoother. The word limit slightly rushes the arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but some elements (e.g., "waves receding") feel decorative rather than integral.</comment>
