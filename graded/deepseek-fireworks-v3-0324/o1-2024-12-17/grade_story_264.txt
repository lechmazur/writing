<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and consistent, with his playful yet cautious nature driving his actions. His distinct voice and use of the magnifying glass reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from skepticism to wonder. The connection between the projector and the alchemist's goal is logical but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming projector, cracked lens) enhancing the mood. The "touched sky" concept elevates the cosmic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (cracked lens as imperfection revealing beauty). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of wonder vs. cynicism could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The alchemist's voice and the projector's hum feel unique, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of enchantment, though the "between innings" detail feels slightly forced.</comment>
