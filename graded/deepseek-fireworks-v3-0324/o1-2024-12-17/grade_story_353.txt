<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bernard's "cynically gentle" nature is well-integrated, but his sudden shift to revolutionary feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed, especially the time machine's introduction and the tyrant's defeat. Pacing suffers slightly under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (metal shavings, violet moonlight). The garage and moonlit hall settings enhance the mystical tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (pressed flowers, shadows) is strong, but the ending resolution feels too neat. Emotional resonance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending baking and revolution, though "seeds of contagion" leans slightly generic. Language avoids clich√©s but occasionally overreaches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The mystical tone and baker protagonist create a memorable, if slightly uneven, whole.</comment>
