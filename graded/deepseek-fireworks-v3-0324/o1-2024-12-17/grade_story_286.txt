<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's reserved nature and profession as a professional apologizer are well-integrated, but their motivation to map seasonal changes feels slightly detached from their core role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by curiosity, though the connection between the vinyl record and seasonal mapping could be tighter. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nanobotanical garden and post-lawless world are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like "metallic petals" are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (vinyl record as authenticity) and subtext (yearning for connection). The ending resonates, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about authenticity in a fractured world.</comment>
