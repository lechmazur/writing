<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alien liaison's dual nature as a teacher and rescuer of knowledge is compelling, but his "righteously flawed" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear, but his internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The connection between the organ's reverberations and the hidden archive is intriguing, but the resolution lacks weight due to the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (steam, mosaics, organ echoes). The atmosphere enhances the story's mystique, though the "concerts" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (puzzle tile, mosaics) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of lost knowledge resonates, but the emotional impact is muted by the brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (fractal language, cosmic mosaics). Avoids clich√©s, though the "fierce tenderness" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the ending lacks punch. The word limit constraints show in the abrupt conclusion, though the core idea lingers.</comment>
