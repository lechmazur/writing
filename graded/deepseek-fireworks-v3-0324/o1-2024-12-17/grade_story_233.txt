<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's naivety and motivation are clear, but his actions sometimes feel inconsistent with his established traits. The distant warmth is a compelling touch, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the "between commercials" timeframe feels underutilized. Pacing is decent, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is richly evoked, with strong sensory details. The murals and guardians enhance the mystery, though the "peculiarly virtual" aspect feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (statue, lullaby) and a memorable ending. However, some metaphors verge on overused, and the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (secret societies, chosen ones). The "rumor-charged" gatherings feel fresh, but prose occasionally slips into florid excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the "commercials" and "virtual" aspects distract. The lullaby motif lingers nicely, suggesting deliberate brevity.</comment>
