<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The chess grandmaster's motivation is clear and consistent, with his strategic thinking and puzzle-solving nature well-aligned with his actions. However, his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but some transitions (e.g., the confetti) feel abrupt. The puzzle mechanism ties the beginning and end neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hydroponic noodle farm is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the dome's atmosphere enhances the mystery. The setting and concept mesh beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chess, puzzles) and evocative prose, though the emotional impact could delve deeper. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The "agonizing bliss" tone is fresh, though some phrases ("pulse of mystery") verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers but could push thematic depth further.</comment>
