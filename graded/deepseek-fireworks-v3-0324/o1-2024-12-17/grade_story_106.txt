<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from despair to resolve. The underwater setting feels slightly underutilized in driving the action, but the thematic payoff is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (flickering lights, flooded turbines) enhancing the mood. The power station's eerie grandeur complements the farmer's introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (quilt, stamps) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the "borrowed valor" theme could be more subtly woven. Literary devices are used effectively.</comment>
