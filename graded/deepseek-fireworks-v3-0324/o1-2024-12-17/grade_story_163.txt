<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her "bitterly optimistic" attribute. The parking stub and scenic overlook memory add depth, though her "lost heiress" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from Earthly detour to xenobiology feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the anomaly discovery could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details (drifting spores, cloud colonies). The migration timeframe enhances atmosphere, though the station's layout could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (parking stub, clouds) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overworked ("tapestry of fear and hope").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the xenobiology premise, but "lost heiress" leans tropey. Some phrasing feels overly ornate ("reckless precision"). Nuanced emotion saves it from cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the detour memory feels tangential. The length suits the story’s ambition, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic wonder.</comment>
