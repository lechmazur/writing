<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tradesman's motivation is clear but his "edgy" nature feels underdeveloped; his pessimism is well-integrated but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The synchronized watches concept is intriguing but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom house and windmill create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (spores, drips, creaking) are exceptionally vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, windmill) and subtext, but the ending's "new horizon" feels somewhat unearned. Literary craft is otherwise sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "vectorize" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion through setting and action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the windmill's thematic weight isn't fully realized. The brevity works in its favor.</comment>
