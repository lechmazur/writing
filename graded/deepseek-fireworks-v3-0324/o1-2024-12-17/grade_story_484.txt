<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leonard's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "groggy brewer" trait feels underutilized. His inner turbulence and flippant solemnity are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the descent and confrontation. The connection between protest and darkness could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the haunted mansion graveyard setting slightly clashes with the protest backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, shadows) and thematic depth, but the ending's resolution feels abrupt. Emotional resonance is high, though.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the mirror-shadow dynamic, but "uniquely generic" and "flippant solemnity" verge on contrived. Avoids most AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the protest framing feels tangential. The brevity works, but some thematic threads could be tighter.</comment>
