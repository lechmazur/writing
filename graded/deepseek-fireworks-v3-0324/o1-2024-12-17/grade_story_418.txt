<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage's headstrong nature and motivation to restore color are clear, but her "merry bitterness" could be more deeply explored to fully round her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the stained glass box and confession serving as effective pivots. Pacing is strong, though the glitter residue feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive storms are vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, shimmering light) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply informs the mage's struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stained glass, glitter), layered themes (regret/rebirth), and a resonant ending elevate this. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "feminize the orchard" risks leaning into tropes. The glitter motif is fresh, and emotional nuance avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, with the record player’s silence and stained glass box feeling indispensable. The brevity serves the story’s intensity.</comment>
