<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dylan's guilt and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "voice" is distinct, though some actions could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition to the witch's chamber feels abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed and immersive, with strong sensory elements. The incantation chamber is vividly rendered, though its introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (the bowl, runes) is effective, and the theme of redemption is compelling. Some emotional beats are told rather than shown, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (guilt-ridden protagonist, mystical redemption). Language avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the tight word limit slightly hampers depth. Leaves a lingering thought but could resonate more powerfully.</comment>
