<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sheriff's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "ghostly resolve" and connection to the chain are intriguing but lack deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract symbolism; the connection between falling stars and the chain's power feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the "ethereally physical" aura occasionally feels overworked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the ending's thematic weight relies too much on implied resonance rather than earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases ("ethereally physical," "ghostly resolve") verge on repetitive. The core metaphor (music vs. dirge) is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but slightly constrained by its abstract elements; the length suits its ambition, though some ideas remain underdeveloped.</comment>
