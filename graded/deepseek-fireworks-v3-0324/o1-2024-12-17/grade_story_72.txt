<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The envoy's sneering demeanor and furiously tranquil tone are distinct but lack deeper exploration. The protagonist's motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed in places. The connection between the folded note and the final revelation is effective, though the pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The domed vineyard and alien plain create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like "shimmering droplets" and "dusty haze" enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (e.g., starlight as "astral tears"). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the envoy's character edges toward clich√©. The prose avoids purple tendencies but occasionally feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The length suits the arc, but some themes could be deeper.</comment>
