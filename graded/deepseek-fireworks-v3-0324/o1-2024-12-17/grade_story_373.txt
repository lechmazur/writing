<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Kana's cybernetic enhancements and her transition from animal care to mechanized creatures are compelling, but her motivation to "devour a sacred taboo" feels slightly abstract, needing more grounding in personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her quest, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions, like the sudden shift to the ritual's completion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic coral and "raucous silence" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the abandoned motels feel underutilized as a setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though some phrases ("raucous silence" repeated) verge on overuse. The cybernetic twist on veterinary work is standout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the word limit slightly hampers deeper exploration of the taboo's significance.</comment>
