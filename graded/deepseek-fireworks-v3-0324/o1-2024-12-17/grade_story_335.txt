<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mercenary's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "carefully reckless" attribute could be more deeply explored to enhance his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mercenary's quest, though the resolution under the marble slab feels slightly abrupt for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with graffiti and crumbling architecture enriching the melancholic tone. Sensory details are strong but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber, spider) and subtext (guilt, absolution) are effective, but the ending's emotional punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The spider motif is fresh, but the "rumor chains" device feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the tight word count slightly strains the thematic depth. The story lingers, but not as hauntingly as it could.</comment>
