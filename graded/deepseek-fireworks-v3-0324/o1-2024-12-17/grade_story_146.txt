<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morgan's dual identity as a faux fortune teller with real visions is compelling, and her motivation to study sacred development is clear and consistent. Her "peaceful anger" adds depth, though its resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by exploration, but the pacing stumbles slightly in the crypt discovery. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though some transitions (e.g., chanting) could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The extinct language archive and hidden temple are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (e.g., flickering torch, haunting melodies). Atmosphere expertly supports Morgan’s quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bone flute, broken statues) and a memorable ending. The theme of truth vs. performance is layered, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "peaceful anger"). Avoids clichés, but occasional phrases ("taken chances") feel slightly formulaic. Nuanced handling of Morgan’s defiance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers on the flute’s duality, though tighter integration of "regularly seldom" would elevate cohesion.</comment>
