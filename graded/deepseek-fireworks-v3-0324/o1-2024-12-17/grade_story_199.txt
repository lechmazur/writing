<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ranger's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "overzealous" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The orchard's fluctuation could be more explicitly tied to the goddess's echo.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly evocative, blending decay and mysticism. Sensory details (rusted guardrails, dim sunsets) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (notebook, orchard) and subtext, though the ending's emotional impact could be sharper. The theme of lost divinity lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The "familiarly unknown" motif is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the notebook's role could be more pivotal. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
