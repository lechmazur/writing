<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mercenary's spinelessness is clear but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; his trembling resolve is evocative but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the pacing wobbles—some transitions feel abrupt, though the prophecy's resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout: the map room’s gloom and the key’s symbolism are richly rendered, though the "hush" motif is overused.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (prophecy, reluctant hero). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity highlights gaps in character depth. The key’s role is inventive.</comment>
