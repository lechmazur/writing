<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's contradiction as a humorless comedic actor is compelling and well-explored, but his motivation to bottle a star’s dying breath feels slightly abstract, though thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically tight, but the action of conceding feels somewhat abrupt, and the daydream loops could be more integrated into the forward momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly vivid, with the deserted playground and twilight air enhancing the story’s melancholic tone. The inkwell’s connection to the setting is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (inkwell, stars) and lyrical prose. The ending is poignant, though the persistent daydream loops could be more sharply rendered to deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clichés. Some phrases verge on overly poetic, but the core concept and execution feel authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative piece that lingers. The brevity works in its favor, though the "objectively personal" element feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
