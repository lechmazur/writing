<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past and present actions revealing depth. His "voice" is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could enhance it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the spin-the-bottle confession feels slightly forced as a plot device. The arc is satisfying, though the future timeframe could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, and the schoolhouse setting enhances the theme. The "unremembered future" is intriguing but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a memorable ending. The theme of corruption vs. redemption is compelling, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "cheerful despair" tone occasionally feels strained. The gambler's internal conflict is nuanced, though some phrasing is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the future setting could be more integral to the central conflict.</comment>
