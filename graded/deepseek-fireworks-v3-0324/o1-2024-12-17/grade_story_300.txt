<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cassius's motivation is clear and consistent, blending determination with a pragmatic, almost mocking defiance of fate. His actions align well with his outlaw persona and quest for the hidden power source.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Cassius's methodical search, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Roman marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details (olives, spices, ivy-draped columns), enhancing the atmosphere and supporting Cassius's clandestine pursuit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (paint smudges as clues) and a satisfying ending. The theme of defiance and discovery is layered, though some emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of historical setting and mystical pursuit, but occasional phrases ("shimmer of possibility") verge on clich√©. Nuance in Cassius's mockery adds authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the pouch and paint-smudge method serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering intrigue about the power source.</comment>
