<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's vivid dreaming and mischievous nature are well-integrated, but his motivation to unravel cosmic deception feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though deeper emotional nuance could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Rowan's exploration, with a clear arc. Pacing is effective, though the resolution of the cosmic deception could be more concrete within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (moon paths, whispers) enhance the mystical tone, though some descriptions verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pennies as keys) and subtext (unspoken remorse). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally. Writing style elevates the story's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the orchard's cosmic deception, but some phrases feel slightly formulaic ("bittersweet flavor of forced silence"). Nuanced emotion is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the cosmic theme risks feeling grandiose for the length. The story lingers but could leave a stronger thematic imprint.</comment>
