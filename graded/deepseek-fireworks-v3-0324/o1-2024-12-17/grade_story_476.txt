<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Radley's gentle brawler persona and motivation to chronicle social changes are well-integrated, though his calmness could be more dynamically contrasted with his physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the flat tire and spice box discovery driving the narrative logically toward the echo chamber. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The echo chamber and "between verses" timeframe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (aroma of spices, layered whispers) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spice box as history's vessel) and a resonant theme of collective memory make this story deeply impactful. The ending is purposeful and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor stiffness in Radley's "peculiarly natural" calmness slightly detracts from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of historical weight.</comment>
