<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theodore's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "hopefully cynical" air and obsession with forgotten arts reveal depth, though his distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Theodore's decoding quest, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing wobbles near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diner's neon-lit atmosphere and encrypted archive concept merge evocatively. Sensory details (grease-stained napkins, whistle's feeble tunes) immerse the reader, amplifying Theodore's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tree of regret, whistle) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overworked. Emotional resonance is achieved through showing, not telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending arcane codes with mundane diner life, though a few phrases feel formulaic ("gnarled branches of regret"). Nuanced handling of emotion avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, with creative integration of assigned prompts. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about redemption. Style supports clarity without oversimplifying.</comment>
