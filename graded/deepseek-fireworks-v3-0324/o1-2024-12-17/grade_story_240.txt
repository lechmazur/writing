<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The soothsayer's pragmatic yet humble nature is well-developed, and her motivation to protect the village is clear and consistent. Her use of the hammer and song reveals depth, though her "force of nature" ambition could be more explicitly tied to her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her forging, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the song and the final glow could be more explicitly foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gnarled forest setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of dread and hope is masterfully sustained. Sensory details (creaking huts, shimmering aura) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hammer, song) and subtext (resilience vs. doom). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "manufactured miracles" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The soothsayer's voice and the forest's personality feel distinct. Some phrases ("lavishly humble") border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of "manufactured" protection.</comment>
