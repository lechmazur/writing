<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The snowflake method is inventive, but the idol's toppling lacks concrete buildup. Pacing is tight but functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—crystalline shadows and spectral blossoms create a haunting, immersive world. The lighthouse orchard is vividly rendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (snowflake geometry, spectral petals). Avoids clichés, though the 'rationally organic' phrasing feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the idol's defeat feels abstract. The length suits the story, leaving room for thematic depth.</comment>
