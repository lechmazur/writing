<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear and consistent, blending cosmic chaos with ancestral duty. His telekinetic dice and tapestry fragment reveal depth, though his "philosophically practical" mindset could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the tapestry's secrets, but the flame's abrupt introduction feels slightly forced. Pacing is tight, though the climax could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The navigation room's atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (holograms, whispers) enhancing tension. The tapestry's arcane significance ties elegantly to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry, dice) and thematic depth (chaos/order, legacy). The ending is purposeful, though the pirate confrontation leans slightly generic.</comment>
