<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear but his "trickster" nature feels underdeveloped; his actions align well with his exile and linguistic quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause-and-effect, though the rivals' dares slightly disrupt pacing. The arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Biodome setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere and Arthur's isolation. Glowing crops and neon vines stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gift tag, paths) and subtext about choices. Ending is purposeful, though emotional resonance could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "synthetic vines coiled like serpents"). Avoids clich√©s but "ghostly resolve" feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though rivals' dares feel tacked on. Length suits the introspective tone, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
