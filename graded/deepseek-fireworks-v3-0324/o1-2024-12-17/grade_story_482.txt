<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The insomniac painter's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his artistic struggle, though his "peacefully chaotic" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the painter's quest, but the transition from classroom to mushroom workshop feels abrupt. Pacing is strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom-canopy setting is vividly rendered and enhances the surreal tone, though the "empty classroom" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and evocative prose elevate the story, though the ending's resolution of fear feels slightly rushed. Themes of artistic truth resonate powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("frolicsome regret") verge on overwrought. The wizard's hat and scrying method feel fresh, avoiding cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the hat and painted smiles central to the narrative. The brevity serves the story’s intensity.</comment>
