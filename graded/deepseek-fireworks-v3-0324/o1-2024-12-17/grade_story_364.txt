<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elinor's skewed visionary nature is well-integrated, driving her obsession with temporal anomalies and vanishing trades. Her motivation is clear, though her distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her discoveries, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the latter half. The arc is clear, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (dusty texts, smudged hieroglyphs) enhancing the mood. The setting supports her mission and the silent revolution theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, imagery) are effective, and the theme of preservation resonates. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict with cynics could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about cultural preservation.</comment>
