<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear but her apathetic devotion feels underdeveloped. The houseplant's sentience adds intrigue but lacks depth in interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the drive-in discovery feels slightly rushed. Pacing balances curiosity and tension well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with the abandoned drive-in and flickering sign enhancing the eerie, ambivalent tone. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (bookmark, film reel) is effective, and the ending lingers. Subtext about unspoken truths is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the houseplant and bookmark, but "scalding ambivalence" feels overworked. Some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the houseplant's role could be tighter. The brevity suits the exploratory theme.</comment>
