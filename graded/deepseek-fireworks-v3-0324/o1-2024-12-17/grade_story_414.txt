<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wanderer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The scrimshaw revelation deepens his character effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot flows logically but feels slightly rushed in the dance class segment. The barricade action is well-integrated, though the ending's thematic resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake and studio create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing algae, turquoise phosphorescence) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scrimshaw as art/life metaphor) and subtext. The ending resonates, though the dance class introduction lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but "pleasantly troublesome" feels contrived. Some descriptions verge on overly ornate without adding depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with art and exploration themes shining. The brevity feels intentional, though the dance class could be tighter.</comment>
