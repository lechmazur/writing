<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Everett's background as a game show host adds depth, but his motivation to rescue sacred knowledge feels slightly forced. Jessamine's role is clearer but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect, though the "gentle overturn" resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The island and insect symphony hall are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's emotional impact is slightly diluted by rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (e.g., mysterious stranger, sacred knowledge). Language avoids purple prose but occasionally feels overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though some elements feel more serviceable than integral. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
