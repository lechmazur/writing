<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian's patient yet hyperactively serene nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to bury old hatred is clear and consistent. Her reaction to the sticker sheet reveals depth, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit, with the sticker sheet and mixtapes driving introspection. Pacing is effective, though the steampunk setting feels underutilized in advancing the plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall and sensory details (metal polish, parchment) create a rich atmosphere. However, the timeframe ("hush of a memory reclaimed") feels slightly disjointed from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sticker sheet, mixtapes) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of hollow victories is explored with nuance. Writing style enhances emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("savage grace") verge on overused. The steampunk twist feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering reflection on ephemeral triumphs. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
