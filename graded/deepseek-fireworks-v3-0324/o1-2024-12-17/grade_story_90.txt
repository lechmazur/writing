<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The contrite swordsman's motivation is clear and consistent, with his regret and earnestness driving his actions. His distinct voice and personality shine through, though his rigid posture could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from mission to resolution. However, the spa setting feels underutilized in driving the action forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating island spa and misty atmosphere are evocative but lack deeper integration with the plot. Sensory details like eucalyptus and rosewater are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (monocle, tattoos) and a satisfying ending. The theme of redemption is clear, though some emotional depth could be shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (the repentant warrior, hidden tattoos). The writing avoids purple prose but could be more daring in style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the spa's role could be more integral.</comment>
