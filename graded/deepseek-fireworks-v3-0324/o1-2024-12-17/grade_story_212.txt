<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jonas is compelling with clear motivation, but "typically atypical" feels underdeveloped. His connection to the seeds and cards is strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the fisherman's revelation lacks buildup. The archway resolution is satisfying but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ethereal plains and post-war atmosphere are vividly rendered, though "raw solace" tone wavers in later sections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and thematic depth, but some metaphors (e.g., "canvas for rebirth") verge on clich√©. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on apocalyptic tropes. Minor AI-like phrasing in descriptive passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but word limit strains pacing. Seeds and cards elevate the narrative uniquely.</comment>
