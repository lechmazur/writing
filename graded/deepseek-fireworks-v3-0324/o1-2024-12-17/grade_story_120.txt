<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit. Cause and effect are well-established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the lure, raindrop) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful and lingers, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
