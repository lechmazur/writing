<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and consistent, with his desire to escape mundanity driving his actions. His use of the ladle and reaction to the meteorite reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from doubt to resolution. The meteorite's role feels slightly abrupt, but the story achieves completeness within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The giant's dining room and rush hour contrast effectively, creating a rich atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., crumbs, meteorite texture) immerse the reader, enhancing the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ladle, meteorite) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly. Theme of quiet transformation is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional phrases verge on flowery. The minstrel's emotional nuance is handled well, though some tropes (e.g., "battered soul") linger.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the meteorite's role could be more organic.</comment>
