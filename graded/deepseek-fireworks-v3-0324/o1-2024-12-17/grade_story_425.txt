<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The morose paladin's motivation is clear, but his emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped. The sewing needle as a keepsake is a strong touch, but his transition from morose to purposeful could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The blackout and observatory setting drive the action effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with the observatory's "lavishly austere" design and cosmic tension enhancing the mood. Sensory details like the hum and flickering lights are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the needle as a bridge) are used well, and the ending is satisfying. However, the theme of restoration vs. despair could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases ("bored excitement") feel slightly contrived. The paladin's reasoning lacks subtlety at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic depth. Leaves a lingering sense of cosmic possibility.</comment>
