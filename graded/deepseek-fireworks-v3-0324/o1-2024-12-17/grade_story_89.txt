<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The warrior's zealous devotion and cryptic mission are compelling, but his internal contradictions could be explored deeper for richer nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the revolution's culmination. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with stellar sensory details (rusted nail's weight, shifting stars). The deck's duality as sanctuary and cosmic lens elevates tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (nail as key, capsules as seeds) and thematic depth. Ending resonates, but some metaphors verge on overused ("false gods").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the capsule method feels underdeveloped. The story lingers, though, with cosmic-meets-spiritual intrigue.</comment>
