<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's character is vividly drawn, with her "careful poisoner" attribute and "innocently guilty" nature shaping her actions and regrets. Her motivation is clear, though slightly abstract ("testing the edges of gravity"). The rapier's symbolism reinforces her duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is intriguing but feels slightly rushed in execution. The connection between beginning and end is present but could be tighter. Pacing is decent, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "dusty starlight" atmosphere and found object museum setting are richly evocative, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (skateboard sounds, flickering exhibits) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier, toxins) and subtext (redemption through discipline). The ending is purposeful but could linger more. Writing style is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("dust draped like starlight in a soft vacuum"). Some phrases verge on purple prose. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the "code of instinct" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the scavenger hunt mechanic slightly overshadows character depth. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, if slightly unresolved, impression.</comment>
