<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past recklessness contrasting well with his newfound purpose. His 'deliberately dreamy' state adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the pilot's investigation, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard labyrinth is vividly rendered, with sensory details (thunder, moss, postcards) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting deeply influences the character's actions and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glove, postcards) and subtext (memory, redemption). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of "borrowed memories" feels fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Nuanced emotion and style stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative integration of the labyrinth and postcards. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of unresolved sorrow.</comment>
