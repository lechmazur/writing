<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathy and its tragically joyful nature are well-integrated, revealing depth through its interactions and thoughts. The calligrapher's motivation is clear, but her backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels somewhat rushed. The connection between the statue and calligrapher is compelling but could benefit from more gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like the hissing valves and flickering gaslamp immerse the reader, though the timeframe ("throughout planning") is less distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hair tie, ink) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional impact could be deeper with more nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The prose is evocative without being overly ornate, though a few phrases border on repetitive ("tragically joyful").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy hope.</comment>
