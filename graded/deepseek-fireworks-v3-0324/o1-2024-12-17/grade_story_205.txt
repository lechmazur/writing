<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The delicate warrior's motivation is clear and consistent, blending cynicism with hope, though his "delicate" nature could be more vividly shown through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the cameo's resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but the climax lacks deeper tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swamp and fireflies create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "sunken roots like unspoken confessions") elevate the mood, though the "peaceful frenzy" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seaweed, cameo) and emotional resonance, but the ending’s thematic punch leans slightly toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors and nuanced emotion, but some phrases ("peaceful frenzy") verge on contrived. Avoids clichés but occasionally over-relies on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "fate of a secret" feels underexplored. The length suits the story, leaving a lingering, if slightly vague, impression.</comment>
