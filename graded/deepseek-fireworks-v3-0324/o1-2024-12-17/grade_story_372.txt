<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spy's lovelorn nature and indifference create an intriguing contrast, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped. The sticky label adds a unique touch, though its significance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the avalanche threat feels distant. The recipe's sudden clarity is a strong pivot, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly rendered with neon and decay, enhancing the spy's desperation. Sensory details like metallic echoes and neon puddles immerse the reader effectively.</comment>
