<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mardin's grumpiness and reluctance are well-established, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His motivation to quell an inner uprising is clear, though his sudden surrender could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from resistance to resolution. The mandala's role as a conduit for trauma is inventive, though the climax's pacing borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crystal scrying room and stargazing setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (candle breaths, refracting tears) amplifying the mystical atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sand as trauma, stars as revolt) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s thematic resonance—trauma as torch—is particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("knights of regret lining ribcage battlements") avoid cliché. Minor stiffness in dialogue ("We must quell an uprising within") slightly undermines authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the mandala and "multiply singular" motif reinforcing theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
