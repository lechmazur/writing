<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lan Zhu's calmness and literal-mindedness are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "spin prophecy into raw possibility" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The butterfly-wing method is inventive, though its execution risks feeling overly whimsical for the tone.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace setting is richly evoked, and the humorous unease melds beautifully with the prophecy's mystical weight. Sensory details (petals, jade library) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors (e.g., "butterfly precise"), layered subtext (fate vs. control), and a resonant ending. The dialogue is sparse but sharp, enhancing the assassin's voice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The botanical press and butterfly-wing method are fresh, though the "whispers of longing" concept edges toward vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of manipulating fate.</comment>
