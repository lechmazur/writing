<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rajiv's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his "rarely authentic" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear, though his final defiance could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the handshake moment and ink-blotter revelation driving the climax. Pacing is excellent, though the tunnel's sudden appearance slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (monsoon-greened brass, thunder) amplifying atmosphere. The collapsing ceiling mirrors Rajiv's breaking chains.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as fate, constellations as escape) elevates the story. The ending’s thematic punch—rewriting agreements—is masterful. Only minor dialogue stiffness holds it back.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending bureaucracy with doomsday prep. Some phrases ("humid dust to his throat") verge on cliché, but the core metaphor feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the ink blotter and temple serving both plot and theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting question about collective survival.</comment>
