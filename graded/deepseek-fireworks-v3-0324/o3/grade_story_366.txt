<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Galen's telepathy and barista role are well-integrated, revealing depth through his sensory approach to problem-solving. Mirelle's urgency and Galen's selfless motivation are clear, though her backstory could be richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with decoding the journal driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned. Minor quibble: the "OUT OF BEANS" sign detracts slightly from urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dock 7's greasy, mechanical atmosphere is vividly rendered, and the seasonal shift enhances tension. Sensory details (kelp leather, coolant drips) are masterfully deployed to immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor (foam as prophecy, steam as mist) and subtext (success as service). The ending lingers, though the "admiral of coffees" line verges on twee.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sensory crossfire"). Avoids clich√©s, but the telepathy element risks gimmickry without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the dock setting and weather theme feel purposeful. Leaves the reader with a resonant meditation on small acts of heroism.</comment>
