<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iniko's zealous warrior persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct actions. His materially spiritual armor and use of the rusted nail reveal depth, though his internal voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the nail and capsules driving a coherent revolution arc. Pacing is excellent, though the prophecy's execution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is breathtakingly immersive, with sensory details (metal screaming, stalled clouds) elevating the atmosphere. The observation deck and variable star are masterfully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (nail as keystone, Talgos's pulse) and layered subtext (oppression as fractured heavens) create profound impact. The ending lingers with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "confusing certainty" tone and fresh metaphors (e.g., "lantern of loose hours") stand out, though some phrasing edges toward ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader haunted by its stellar rebellion.</comment>
