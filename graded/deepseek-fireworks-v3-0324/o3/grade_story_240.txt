<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viellin's pragmatic soothsayer nature is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her "lavishly humble" cloak and refusal of extremes reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from return to transformation. Pacing is excellent, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village and iron graveyard are richly evoked, with sensory details (creaking bridges, molten ore) enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("hammer rose from ash like a starling of iron") and subtext (miracles as debts). The ending is both satisfying and haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of pragmatism and mysticism feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful, not purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The story lingers, with thematic depth ("storm, shelter, and story") elevating it beyond the word limit.</comment>
