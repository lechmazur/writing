<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "trustworthy unique" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her role as a wandering orchardist, and her voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the multiverse element slightly disrupts coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly rendered, and sensory details (brine, barnacles) enhance atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the story's mood and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (leaves as maps, kitchen table wisdom) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "bittersweet grit" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The story avoids clich√©s and demonstrates a unique style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth and emotional resonance.</comment>
