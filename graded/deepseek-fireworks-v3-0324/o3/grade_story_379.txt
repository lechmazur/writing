<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hale Keswick's motivation is clear and compelling, blending trickster charm with scholarly urgency. The fractured Awa-Nusa greeting reveals depth, though his "impatiently patient" duality could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot thrives on tension between flight and preservation, with cryptic dares driving momentum. Pacing is tight, though the drone's arrival feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Biodome details (photosynthetic kale, methane storms) are vivid and purposeful. The "ghostly resolve" tone merges beautifully with Awa-Nusa's dying echoes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("verbs for wind that can bruise metal") and subtext (guilt-as-redemption). The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh twists on tropes (trickster-as-linguist) and startling imagery ("tattoos of weather codes crawled"). Only minor over-reliance on "ghostly" descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves reader pondering languageâ€™s ephemerality versus legacy.</comment>
