<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garrick's sullenness and desperation are vividly portrayed, and his motivation to escape his past is clear and compelling. His actions with the quilt and stamps reveal depth, though his "borrowed valor" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from descent to ascent. The quilt's magical realism and the stamps' symbolism drive the narrative coherently, though the breach feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater power station is hauntingly evocative, and the algae-flecked light and hissing seawater create a rich atmosphere. The setting amplifies Garrick's isolation and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (quilt as map, stamps as passports) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, with layered themes of escape and rebirth. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The quilt's cartographic magic and the stamps' role feel inventive. Nuanced emotion avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity serves the story, leaving a lingering sense of liberation. Creative and deeply thematic.</comment>
