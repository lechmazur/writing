<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Silas Crane's rattled psyche and exorcist background are vividly portrayed, with his terror and coy aggression adding depth. His motivation to verify the supernatural is clear, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with puzzles driving momentum and a clear arc from tension to revelation. Pacing is excellent, though the basement discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and tango classes create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lavender, phosphorescent ink) elevate the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (demons whispering bolero, reliquary as confessional) and subtext about commodified faith make this unforgettable. The ending balances spectacle with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (doves dyed in nightmares) and no clich√©s. The blend of science and mysticism feels inventive, though Dr. Voss's character edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the postcard and puzzles serving the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about faith's exploitation.</comment>
