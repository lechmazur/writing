<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Koji's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions and "mindfully scattered" thoughts revealing depth. His "graceful swordsman" persona is subtly integrated, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Koji's innovation driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending resolves while leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescence, corroded brass). Atmosphere and setting amplify the story's themes of isolation and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (star-maps as hope, statues as guardians) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, though the "lucid frenzy" tone occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "bladewhip dancing through currents"). Minimal clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers with thematic weight (individuality vs. conformity).</comment>
