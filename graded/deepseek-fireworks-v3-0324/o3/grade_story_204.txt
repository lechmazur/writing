<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from detached cuddler to someone who feels "touched" is compelling, though his initial emotional detachment could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the farmer's market encounter and subsequent revelation at the awards gala creating a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly evoked—basil and neutron lotus, the spectral punch, the hangar—all contribute to a unique, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the punch, decay) and subtext (prejudice, intimacy). The ending is resonant and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("amber freeing an ancestor") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés and AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, leaving a lingering impact. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
