<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's mechanical arm and philosophical dueling are vividly integrated into his character, revealing depth through his fear of never experiencing his own dreams. His motivation is clear and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from pursuit to resolution. The relic's activation through vulnerability is a strong, logical payoff. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (peeling paint, metallic applause) enhancing the mood. The sock as a symbol is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolism (orb as dream-tapestry, sock as punctuation). The ending is satisfying and layered, with emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>
