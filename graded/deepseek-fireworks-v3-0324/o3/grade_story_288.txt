<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden and Mira are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Their actions align with their traits, though Mira's paddleboarding champion backstory feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ozone station setting is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (hissing lights, charred paddleboard) enhance atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flag as catalyst, sculpture as sentinel). The ending lingers with emotional and thematic weight. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "audacious meekness" teeters on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
