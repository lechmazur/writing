<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marigold's ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and interactions with precision. Her motivation to decode rock art is clear and consistent, revealing depth through her methods and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the road trip and stone circle investigation forming a coherent arc. Pacing is effective, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical and well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stone circle and twilight setting are richly atmospheric, enhanced by sensory details (cold ridges, lavender chiffon light). The busker's music and glyphs deepen the mood, aligning perfectly with Marigold's motives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "eternity as an arrangement table") and symbolism. The ending is purposeful, leaving a lingering thematic weight. Subtext about sacrifice and guardianship elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés with fresh imagery (e.g., "polite anarchy"). Nuanced emotion and stylistic individuality distinguish it from formulaic writing. No purple prose—language is vivid yet precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, with creative combinations (e.g., comb as baton/scalpel). Leaves a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
