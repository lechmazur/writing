<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending doubt with reverence for tradition. Her actions align well with her "rationally rebellious" nature, though her "unsure champion" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Lira's journey through the colony serving as a cohesive arc. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful, though the transition to the gala could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (salt-spray, church bells) enhancing the atmosphere. The "cheerful gloom" tone is masterfully sustained, enriching the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and symbolism (e.g., the brooch as compass), the story evokes reflection on tradition and innovation. Literary devices are used deftly, and the ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, and the handling of "imperfect love" feels fresh. Minor quibble: "bottled sunsets" borders on overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
