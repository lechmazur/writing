<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and compelling, her bitter optimism driving her actions. The parking stub as a keepsake adds depth, though her "reckless precision" could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the detour and unification arc resolving cohesively. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though Dr. Kesh's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—migrating clouds, gravitational eddies, and the station create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "clouds murmured algebra") elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (parking stub as temporal anchor) and lyrical prose ("butterflies that forgot their bodies") enhance impact. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fragmented reality concept is handled with nuance, though "reckless precision" slightly strains believability in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are masterfully integrated; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. The lingering question of "broader corridors of becoming" adds depth.</comment>
