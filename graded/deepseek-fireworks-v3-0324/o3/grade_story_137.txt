<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's subtle illusionist background and motivation to learn the heart's language are well-integrated, though his "casually intense" demeanor could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lace pattern's deciphering driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from cashier to temple could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple's ethereal atmosphere and sensory details (marble clouds, lace's flutter) are masterfully rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone and Milo's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lace as language, understory as longing) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the "choir feeding sunrise" metaphor feels slightly overreaching.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors ("canopy waiting to part"). Minor stiffness in phrases like "doleful cheer" slightly undermines authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, though the cashier's role could be more integral.</comment>
