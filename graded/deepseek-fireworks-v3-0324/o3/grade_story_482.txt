<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's insomniac painter persona is vividly rendered, with her restless creativity and distrust of smiles driving her actions. Her motivation to outlast sleep is clear, though her transition to spectral fading feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Liora's pursuit of truth through paint, but the resolution with Argent's ghostly return leans on surrealism without full narrative grounding. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arboreal mushroom setting is lushly atmospheric, with glow spores and bark walkways enhancing the dreamlike tone. Sensory details (cold tea, turpentine fumes) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bullet as punctuation, painted smiles) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is haunting but slightly opaque in its thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "prank wrapped in an epitaph"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "frolicsome regret" tone wobbles in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, stylistically bold vignette. The brevity feels intentional, though some thematic depth is sacrificed for whimsy.</comment>
