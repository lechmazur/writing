<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ysolde's critical nature and midwife role are well-integrated, revealing depth through her mission and internal conflict. Her "openly secretive" trait adds intrigue, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the diaries and herbs driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ash, herbs, storm) are masterfully deployed to enhance mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ladder of light, eroded wisdom) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "pearls refusing gravity"). Minor stumbles in phrasing ("dissonant calm" repeats) but avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and humility.</comment>
