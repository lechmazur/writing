<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's skewed visionary nature is vividly portrayed, with her cracked spectacles and obsession with mundane miracles adding depth. Her motivation to photograph vanishing trades is clear and drives the plot, though the narrator's own motivations could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the temporal anomaly study serving as a logical entry point. The transition to the past via hieroglyphs is inventive, and the looping decay of the tradespeople adds coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted, blending the sterile lab with the dew-slicked alley. Sensory details (saddle soap, hammering coppersmiths) immerse the reader. The setting enhances the theme of ephemerality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (e.g., "the air folded—a page turned"), the story evokes melancholy and wonder. The ending lingers, and the theme of preservation as memorial is poignant. Subtext is strong, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of temporal science and vanishing trades feels fresh. Metaphors ("cameras were hospice nurses") are striking. Emotion is shown through action and imagery, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. The combination of hieroglyphs and Polaroids is ingenious. Leaves the reader with a haunting sense of "small thunder."</comment>
