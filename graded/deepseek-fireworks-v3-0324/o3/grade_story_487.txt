<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Huxley's docile bruiser persona and brash tenderness are compelling, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his traits, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The treasure map and baton pursuit create a cohesive arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (ozone, wet tongues, drum echoes) immerse the reader. The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly menacing and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft (metaphors like "paradiddles of courage"), layered subtext (language barriers vs. music), and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Minor overuse of "disturbingly calm."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("skein of veins") and nuanced emotion. Some phrases ("brash tenderness") verge on over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question: Can silence truly be bullied into song?</comment>
