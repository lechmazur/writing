<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ash's late-blooming heroism and softly militant resolve are vividly portrayed, with his motivation to dissect cosmic balance driving his actions consistently. His distinct voice and nuanced reactions to loss elevate the character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's structure is tight and coherent, with Ash's attic-scouring method logically advancing his quest. The arc from despair to tentative hope is well-managed within the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and shattered skyline create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (rust, dust, brine) immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies the gravity of loss and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spyglass, mandala) and layered subtext. The ending is poignant and purposeful, with themes of grief and balance resonating beyond the narrative. Literary craft is nearly flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghost constellations") and nuanced emotion distinguish the prose. No AI-generic phrasing or tonal inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. The story transcends its constraints with creative depth.</comment>
