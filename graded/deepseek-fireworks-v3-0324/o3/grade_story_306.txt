<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Felix's oddity and past as a child star are vividly portrayed, driving his motivation to seek something beyond fame. His actions align with his eccentric, fame-weary persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the map's instructions leading logically to the climax. Pacing is excellent, balancing surrealism with narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chamber's humming, the map's circus-peanut scent, and the subsonic choir create a rich, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's strangeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("acne scars a constellation map") and symbolism. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, leaving room for interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery. Avoids clich√©s, and the emotional resonance feels earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
