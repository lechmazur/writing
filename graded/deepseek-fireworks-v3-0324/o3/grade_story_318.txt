<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa's aloofness and halfhearted commitment are well-established, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt. The spoon's impact on her is vivid, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the spoon's discovery driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the rebellion's stakes could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The memory crystal library is richly imagined, and the "architecture of the mind" sequence is a standout. Sensory details are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (spoon as tuning fork, lullabies as courage). The ending is resonant, and the theme of commitment is powerfully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "gloomy cheerfulness" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully. The spoon's role is ingenious, and the story lingers after reading. A near-flawless micro-narrative.</comment>
