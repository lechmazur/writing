<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's gentle conjurer persona is well-defined and consistent, with clear motivation tied to his mother's exile. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The word limit is used efficiently, though the contest resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with emberlight and quartz stairs enhancing the underground city's atmosphere. Sensory details (fragrance of the petal, cracking helm) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly as justice) and layered themes (restoration vs. revenge) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the High Smith's defeat could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in reversed messages and the butterfly's role. Some phrases ("joyful terror") verge on repetitive, but the core concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the garden and butterfly reinforcing theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
