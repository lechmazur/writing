<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morwen Crest is vividly portrayed with distinct traits (insomniac poet, botanical obsession), but her motivation to spread non-violence could be more explicitly tied to her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the transition from subway to attic feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (ozone, dust motes) enhancing the mood. The subway and attic settings are meaningfully contrasted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (plants as witnesses, silence as violence) and literary devices (metaphors like "violin string mid-rest") elevate the storytelling. Ending is resonant and thematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("planetary orbits" for eye rings). Avoids clich√©s, though the "haunted attic" trope is slightly under-subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about the intersection of botany and ethics.</comment>
