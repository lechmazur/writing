<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tarquin's motivation is clear and compelling, blending personal vendetta with a quest for discovery. His actions align well with his "precisely creative" attribute, though his shift from scorn to wonder could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from revenge to redemption. The counterattack method is inventive, though the transition from rebellion to escape feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market and rebellion-era setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sugar, caramel) enhancing the atmosphere. The tone of "ardent scorn" permeates effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sugar as weaponry, locket as map) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the admiral's daughter's guilt could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (molten sugar fireworks) and minimal clich√©s. The prose avoids excess ornamentation while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thematically resonant narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering wonder.</comment>
