<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "theoretically rebellious" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his goal, but his distinct voice is muted by the poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from barrenness to renewal. The comet and weathervane alignment feel slightly contrived, but the cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (phosphorescent dust, rustling petals) are exceptionally vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the villagers' sudden shift from fear to action could be more nuanced. Literary craft is nearly flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("deliberate wilderness") verge on overused. The hermit's logic feels slightly too pristine, lacking human irrationality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story elegantly, though the weathervane method feels overly precise for the tone.</comment>
