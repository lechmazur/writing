<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's reckless yet meticulous nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to map ghost towns is clear and compelling. His interaction with the vintage camera lens reveals depth, though his "meticulously careless" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the forgotten promise driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity. Minor room to deepen cause-and-effect links.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair and misty forest are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (rust, wet brass, rattling chains) enhancing immersion. The setting perfectly complements the story's eerie, melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("guilt lunged," "footprints shaped like treble clefs") and layered subtext elevate the storytelling. The ending is poignant, though the theme of "wise choices" could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh imagery and originality shine, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lyrical but purposeful. A few phrases ("atomize into myth," "velvet remembrance") flirt with over-ornamentation but remain effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers emotionally. Minor tightening could make the thematic payoff even sharper.</comment>
