<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grindle's melancholy and motivation to restore sacred practices are clear and consistent, but his jester role feels slightly underutilized in driving deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the paint-drying timeframe creating urgency. The resolution elegantly ties the sigil's purpose to the submarine's survival, though Faraday's shift in skepticism could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming girders, whistling boiler) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the tension between ritual and machinery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tea leaves as cartography, paint as solvent for doubt) elevates the story. The ending satisfies while leaving room for thematic reflection on unity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the jester archetype leans slightly tropey. The tea-leaf method is inventive, but Faraday's engineer-iconoclast duality could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of reconciling opposites lingers powerfully.</comment>
