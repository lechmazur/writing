<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Felix's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions with a blend of artistry and vengeance. His "clumsily dexterous" nature adds a unique texture to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action logically leading to the climax. The word limit is used efficiently, though the pantomime confession feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and stained glass fragment create a haunting, tactile atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "velvet quiet," "chalk dust") immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stained glass as a "censored curse") and subtext. The ending is both satisfying and unsettling, leaving room for reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
