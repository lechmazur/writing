<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ildra's meekness and sincerity are consistently portrayed, and her motivation to regain a forgotten lullaby is both clear and poignant. Her actions align perfectly with her character, and her distinct voice shines through.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Ildra's approach to the tapestry to its dissolution. The pacing is effective, and the cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered, with phosphorescent stalactites and playground sounds adding depth. The atmosphere enhances the mystic tone and supports Ildra's quest beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with rich symbolism (the broken pen, the tapestry) and evocative imagery. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of memory and connection resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "death is merely ink spilled from time").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. The brief length feels intentional, and the story lingers in the mind.</comment>
