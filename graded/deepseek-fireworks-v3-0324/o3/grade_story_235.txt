<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Isamu's motivations and actions are subtly yet powerfully conveyed, with his herbalist background and meteor-decoding method revealing a deeply introspective character. Aya's development is equally nuanced, though slightly less explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured, with meteor showers and pigment rituals driving the narrative toward a resonant, understated climax. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The castle's transformation into an academy is hauntingly vivid, with sensory details (rain, incense, grinding pigments) immersing the reader. Atmosphere and setting are flawlessly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (meteors as fate, bridges as longing) and subtext. The ending lingers with poetic precision, and the prose elevates the story to near-perfect literary craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The meteor-decoding premise feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple excess while maintaining lyrical density. Emotional resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, luminous whole. Every element serves the story’s quiet power, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with a haunting sense of unspoken connections.</comment>
