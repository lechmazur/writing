<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his actions, though his "enthusiastic apathy" could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the hacking sequence feels slightly rushed. Pacing is otherwise excellent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—sensory details (rust, lavender, ozone) immerse the reader. The setting enhances the story’s melancholy allure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices (e.g., "bruised-purple code"). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional crescendo could linger longer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. Metaphors ("dusty starlight") are fresh, and the voice avoids cliché. Nuanced handling of contradiction elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply resonant. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of longing and defiance.</comment>
