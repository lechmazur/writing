<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's sober cardsharp persona is vividly rendered, with his methodical approach and cold arithmetic aligning well with his motivation. His distinct voice and actions reveal depth, though his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and effective pacing. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the transition to the manor feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-covered island and eerie manor are richly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (ink well) are meaningfully connected, amplifying the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (ink, cards) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the writing style elevates the narrative. Minor quibble: the radio's silence could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The story avoids clich√©s and demonstrates a unique voice, though the "grudging admiration" motif feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story masterfully. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of mystery. A standout piece with minimal flaws.</comment>
