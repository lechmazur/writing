<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jarun's aloofness and curiosity are well-integrated, driving his actions believably. Miya's backstory adds depth, though her introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The turbine's revival provides a satisfying resolution, though the bureaucratic threat is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The port city's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rust, tidewater) enhancing the mood. The labyrinthine setting amplifies the story's tension.</comment>
