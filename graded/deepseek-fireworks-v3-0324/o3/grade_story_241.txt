<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lune and Calven are vividly drawn, with distinct roles and motivations. Their partnership is nuanced, though Calven's "weather-bruised" backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from summoning to resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the detour train feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details (candles, copper-leaf journal) and the Floating Cloud Cafe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vest as atlas, silent plains) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the "blissful agony" theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "vest’s constellations"). Minor over-reliance on "rare" and "shimmer," but avoids clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where elements serve the story. Leaves a resonant question: What other silences need translation?</comment>
