<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ravax's anger and desperation are vividly portrayed, and his shift from fury to raw vulnerability is compelling. The narrator's calm yet biting sincerity contrasts well, though his motivation could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with jogging as a clever framing device. The tea-leaf prophecy and hidden waterfalls resolve organically, though the transition to Ravax's change of heart feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (steam, coolant, dust) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the story's tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (chopstick as wand, waterfalls as rebellion) and layered subtext. The ending lingers, and the prose is sharp without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The chopstick and tea-leaf method feel fresh, and the emotional beats are nuanced rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant impression.</comment>
