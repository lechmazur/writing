<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marigold's "perfectly flawed" nature is vividly portrayed, with her librarian precision and adventurous curiosity driving her actions. Her motivation to become a legend is clear and consistent, and her distinct voice shines through the narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the stolen tag and canyon portals driving the narrative logically. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the pacing feels slightly rushed near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The portal-strewn canyon is richly evoked with sensory details (peppery pumpkin stew, basalt carvings). The setting enhances the story's mystical tone and Marigold's journey, creating a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "grace ripened like fruit") and subtext (cosmic footnotes, rebalanced grace). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of flawed humanity seeking legacy resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The story avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, though the "harvesting grace" concept borders on abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with all elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about legacy and imperfection.</comment>
