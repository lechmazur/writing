<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blacksmith's wistful nature and drifting arrogance are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "voice" is distinct, though deeper introspection could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from conception to rebellion. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect logic is flawless. The word limit is used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with cyberpunk and organic contrasts heightening the theme. Sensory details (neon rain, malfunctioning music) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (leaf tokens, dust motes) and subtext (corporate vs. wild) create layers. The ending is poignant, and the style enhances impact. Minor room for deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "forge hymn") and nuanced emotion. No AI tropes; style is distinct and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about reclaiming modernity’s soul.</comment>
