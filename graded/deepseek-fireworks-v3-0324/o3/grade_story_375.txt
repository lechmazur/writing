<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vivid and consistent, blending anger with poetic purpose. The "smiling saboteur" persona is distinct, though slightly underdeveloped in backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from intent to execution. Pacing is excellent, though the mannequin dialogue risks slight contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (wind, dust, static) amplifying the gorge's decay. Setting and tone are flawlessly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (Betelgeuse, cracks as verses) elevates the narrative. Ending resonates with thematic depth, though the climax's physics might strain credulity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors ("porcelain faces... meteoric scars"). No clich√©s; emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, lyrical whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on destruction as art.</comment>
