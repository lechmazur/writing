<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh turns of phrase ("molten sarcasm distilled into enamel") and a distinct voice avoid clich√©. Only minor over-reliance on sarcasm as a crutch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting, cohesive whole. The ending lingers, balancing resolution with open-ended thematic weight.</comment>
