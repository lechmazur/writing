<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orren's uncertainty and playful precision are vividly portrayed, driving his actions and revealing depth. His motivation to heal histories is clear and consistent, though his "precisely playful" nature could be more explicitly tied to his archival work.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the labyrinthine path and unmasking action creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the golden age timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (hollow thuds, collimated light) enhancing the fractured beauty. The setting and object (purse) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mask, labyrinth) and subtext (certainty vs. curiosity) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "broken precedents" could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "living scroll whose ink was resonance"). Minor risk of ornate phrasing, but the style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the nature of archives and curiosity.</comment>
