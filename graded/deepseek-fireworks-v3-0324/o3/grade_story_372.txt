<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel's lovelorn spy persona is compelling, but Pepper's "curiously indifferent" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their motivations align well, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Futuristic slums are vividly rendered, and sensory details (neon, spicy steam) enhance atmosphere. Reflections tie beautifully to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (edible time, rambling destiny) and striking metaphors elevate this. Emotional resonance lingers after reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s. Fresh similes ("rain fizzed like static") and nuanced emotion distinguish it from AI tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of longing and escape.</comment>
