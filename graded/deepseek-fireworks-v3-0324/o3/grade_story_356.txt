<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sister Kel's motivation is clear and deeply personal, aligning with her actions and the story's concept of time manipulation. Her "warmly aloof" demeanor adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The pacing is deliberate, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (ionized rust, stolen oranges) that enhance the atmosphere. The cargo hold's "gentle harshness" mirrors Kel's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (e.g., "time was less a river than a nervous tremor"), the story evokes melancholy and introspection. The ending is hauntingly satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors are fresh ("cloud paths unspooled across the vacuum"), and the emotional resonance is subtle yet profound.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with each element serving the narrative. It lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond its length.</comment>
