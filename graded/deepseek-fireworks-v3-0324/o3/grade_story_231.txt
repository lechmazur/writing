<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Naram's sentimental and spontaneous nature is vividly portrayed, driving his actions and decisions. His motivation—seeking justice for his flock—is clear and compelling, though his "habitually spontaneous" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The coordinates and hairpin serve as effective plot devices, though the transition to the tribunal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Sumerian setting is richly evoked with sensory details (salt, smoke, cuneiform). The atmosphere of prophetic dust and chaotic humility enhances the story's tension and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hairpin, constellations) and subtext (justice as a transactional force). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful without being overly ornate. The story feels distinctly human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, with elements seamlessly integrated. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers in the mind.</comment>
