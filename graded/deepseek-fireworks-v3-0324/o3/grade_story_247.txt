<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilan's weathered poet persona is vividly rendered, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His actions align well with his cartographic and devotional drive, though his emotional duality (joy/dread) could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coffee cup sleeves and transformer resolution creating a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the labyrinth's curation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (iron on the wind, petal snow) immerse the reader. The bonsai labyrinth and power outage setting synergize perfectly with the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: metaphors ("joy vibrated like a struck bell") and symbolism (mirror, sleeves) elevate the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "breathing light" borders on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh imagery and nuanced emotion. Minor flaws: "joyful dread" risks cliché, and the compact's role feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering resonance—though the labyrinth's curator could be more subtly hinted.</comment>
