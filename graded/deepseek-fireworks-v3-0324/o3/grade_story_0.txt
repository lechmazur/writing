<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lamm's sheepish spy persona and analytically creative impulses are well-integrated, but his motivation to charm the monster could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic, though the resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Pattern Recognition Center's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (thermal hum, rainbow refractions) enhancing the surreal tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("dreamed in statistics," "silk syllable") and no clich√©s. The earnest mockery tone is distinct and consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
