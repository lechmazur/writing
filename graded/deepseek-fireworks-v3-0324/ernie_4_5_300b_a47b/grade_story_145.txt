<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and well-developed, revealing depth through her internal conflict and the rosebud's symbolism. Her actions align with her established traits, though her "uncertainly certain" state could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with the echo test method driving the story organically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (mildew, guttering lantern) enhancing the setting's eerie yet melancholic tone. The ruin library and hidden chamber are seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling is impactful, with strong symbolism (rosebud, mirrors) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematic, though the dialogue could be slightly more natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The rosebud's revival and the Order's emotional prison are fresh concepts. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("uncertainly certain").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering resonance, though the "hush of colliding destinies" phrase feels slightly forced.</comment>
