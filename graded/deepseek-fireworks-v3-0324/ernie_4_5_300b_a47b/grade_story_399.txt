<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alaric's grumpy demeanor and centuries-old grief are convincingly portrayed, with his motivation to quell inner turmoil clear and consistent. His reaction to the tube and mandala reveals deep-seated trauma, but his shift to weeping feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tube's mystery driving the narrative. The mandala's transformation and Alaric's emotional arc are coherent, though the resolution's pacing feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (humming tube, shifting sand) are evocative and deepen the mood, though the "fractal beauty" description leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sand as trauma, constellations as guidance) and a resonant theme elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the witch's advice ("multiply singular") could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original handling of trauma avoids clich√©s, and the prose avoids purple excess. The grumpy caretaker trope is subverted by his vulnerability, though the "grandiose subtlety" tone wobbles briefly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, lyrical whole. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with emotional depth. Minor quibbles prevent a perfect score.</comment>
