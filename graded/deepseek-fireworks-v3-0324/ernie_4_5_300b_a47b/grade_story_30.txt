<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivations and traits are clear and distinct, particularly his blending of luck and probability manipulation. Jara's skepticism provides a strong counterpoint, though her philosophically practical nature could be more explicitly tied to her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dice, tapestry, and pirate attack logically escalating tension. The resolution is satisfying, though the farming methods metaphor feels slightly forced in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The navigation room's "sacred disorder" is vividly rendered, and the fusion of ancient tapestry with futuristic tech creates a unique atmosphere. Sensory details (flame, sonic bursts) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dragons, sapling) and subtext (tradition vs. survival). The ending lingers, though Kael's dialogue occasionally veers into exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fusion of farming rituals and space piracy is inventive, though the "lost language" concept leans slightly on genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s core tension. The brief length feels purposeful, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
