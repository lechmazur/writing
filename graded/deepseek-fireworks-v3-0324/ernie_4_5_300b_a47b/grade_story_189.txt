<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "uniquely literal" mind driving her actions. Her "brazen calm" is a strong attribute, though slightly more depth in her backstory could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost's appearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the eerie tone. The connection between the lighthouse and the war for water is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism and subtext, with the star maps and aquifer hinting at broader themes. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and a distinct voice. The only minor flaw is the ghost's dialogue, which leans slightly tropish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, though a touch more thematic depth would make it flawless.</comment>
