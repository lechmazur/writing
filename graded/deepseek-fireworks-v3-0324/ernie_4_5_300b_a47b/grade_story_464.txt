<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot moves briskly but coherently, with each chest’s reveal escalating chaos. Pacing is tight, and the ending reshapes the world meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The office’s surreal atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (neon stew, humming ladle) enriching the tone. Twilight complements the liminal theme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors avoid clichés. Some phrases border on overly ornate but generally serve the tone. Emotional subtext is deftly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering question about order vs. chaos.</comment>
