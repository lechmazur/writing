<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s impassive demeanor contrasts with her secret longing for transcendence, making her complex. Her motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped—more internal reflection would elevate it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the twist tie and bees’ language driving the arc. Pacing is superb, but the ending’s abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral’s decay and the orchard’s vibrancy create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (bees’ hum, apple scent) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (twist tie as talisman, bees as guides) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of hidden grace resonates, though the ending could linger longer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "personally impersonal" attribute feels slightly forced. The bees’ language is a standout, avoiding tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize beautifully, but the oil change motif feels underutilized. The story’s brevity is a strength, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
