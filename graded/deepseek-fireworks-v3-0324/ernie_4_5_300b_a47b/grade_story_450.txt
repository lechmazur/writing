<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly constructed, with a satisfying arc, though the prophecy's twist feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chamber and bubble bath create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, but the "sterile room" detail clashes with the humid, mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism, emotional resonance, and a memorable ending. The dialogue is sparse but effective, and the theme of denial is powerfully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The voice is distinct, though a few phrases ("cosmic entropy") verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the story feels deliberate rather than constrained. Lingers in the mind after reading.</comment>
