<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his character; his "raucously silent" nature and doomed romance add layers, though his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the method of using the bell's echo is inventive. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The utopia design studio is vividly rendered with rich sensory details, and the contrast between its sterility and Elias's rebellion enhances the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (keys, bell) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The writing avoids clich√©s and feels distinctly stylized, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements woven organically into the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
