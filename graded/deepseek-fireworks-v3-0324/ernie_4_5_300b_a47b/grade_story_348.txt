<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scout's humble nature and meticulous ritualistic behavior are vividly portrayed, aligning well with her motivation to uncover ancestral secrets, though her somnambulism could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly from discovery to revelation, with the lightning bugs acting as a natural catalyst. Pacing is tight yet immersive, though the tunnel's sudden appearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the lab's decay and bioluminescent cavern evoke a haunting, mystical mood. Sensory details (copper air, murky water) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lightning bugs as keys, the Veil) and layered themes of legacy and thresholds. The ending lingers with quiet menace, though the grandmother's hologram could be more subtly introduced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, avoiding clich√©s. The lightning bugs' role as both literal and metaphorical guides is inventive, though the "forest's tongue" phrasing borders on overused mysticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that feels deliberate in its brevity. Combines elements with organic ingenuity, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
