<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with the comic serving as a potent symbol of rebellion. His voice is distinct, though his "passive conspirator" trait could be more actively demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the comic and simulator driving the arc. Pacing is excellent, and the ending resonates, though the "dance of generations" concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hum of lights, desert sands) enhancing atmosphere. The comic and setting are meaningfully linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism (comic as manifesto, fractal cape). The ending lingers, and the prose style elevates the story. Minor quibble: Mara's dialogue could feel sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (time as origami, fear's lines) are inventive. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of defiance.</comment>
