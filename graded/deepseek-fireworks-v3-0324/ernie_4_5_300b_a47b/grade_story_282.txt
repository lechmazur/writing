<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jax's brashness and wildness are vividly portrayed, and his motivation to preserve tradition is clear. His actions align well with his character, but the depth of his backstory could be richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Jax's defiance, but the detonation feels abrupt. The tight word limit leaves little room for buildup.</comment>
