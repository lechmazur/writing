<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe’s astute nature and hermit-like resolve are vividly portrayed, with his silence and tool use revealing depth. Motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the elevator’s arrival and bread’s scent driving action logically. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cavern cathedral’s atmosphere is masterfully evoked through sensory details (bioluminescence, bread scent). Setting and tone merge seamlessly to heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scissor as hope, bread as catalyst) and literary craft elevate the story. Ending is purposeful, though subtext could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés, but a few phrases ("gravel in a tin can") edge toward predictability. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, with the scissor and bread serving the narrative organically. Length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
