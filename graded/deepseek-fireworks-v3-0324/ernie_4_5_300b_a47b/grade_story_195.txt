<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jessa's motivation is vivid and consistent, weaving her past and present seamlessly. Her "analytically unpredictable" nature adds depth, though her dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the moon trails serving as a clever, coherent device. Pacing is excellent, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nomadic setting and spring cleaning timeframe enrich the atmosphere brilliantly. Sensory details (e.g., "crunching dried grass") are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with potent symbolism (the thread as a bridge). Literary devices are deftly employed, though the ending’s resolution could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("moon trails like breadcrumbs"). Nuanced handling of joy and sorrow avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about rediscovery, showcasing depth beyond the plot.</comment>
