<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo's jaded bartender persona meshes well with his lab assistant role, and his motivation to understand the past is clear. His use of the scalpel and receipts reveals depth, though his sudden optimism feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc from resignation to resolve. The connection between receipts and fate is intriguing but could be more tightly woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lab's cold, crystalline atmosphere contrasts brilliantly with the fireworks' chaos, enhancing Leo's introspection. Sensory details (mineral smells, glinting scalpel) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scalpel as defiance, crystals as fractured reflection) and a thought-provoking ending. The theme of rewriting fate is compelling, though the resolution leans slightly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("fate was a bully") and nuanced emotion elevate this beyond clich√©. The lab setting and scalpel motif feel original, avoiding AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the lab and receipts serving the theme ingeniously. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions.</comment>
