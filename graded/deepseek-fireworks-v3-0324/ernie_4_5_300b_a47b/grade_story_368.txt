<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jessa's streetwise nature and orphan background are well-integrated into her actions and decisions, revealing depth through her interaction with the brooch and the temple's test.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the brooch's curse and Jessa's choice driving a clear, resonant arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the time-blurring moment feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is masterfully evoked with sensory details (decaying peaches, shifting shadows), enhancing the story's tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the brooch as mirror, reversed patterns) and emotional depth elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, though the "confident uncertainty" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "mosaic of stolen moments") and a distinct voice avoid cliché. Only minor quibbles: "theoretically random" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving a lasting thematic impression.</comment>
