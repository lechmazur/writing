<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The word limit is well-managed, though the ending’s abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The suspended palace and amber clouds create a striking, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "shuddering stalactites") elevate the setting’s role in tension.</comment>
