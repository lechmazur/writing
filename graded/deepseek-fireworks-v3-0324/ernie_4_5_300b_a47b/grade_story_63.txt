<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her heritage, with consistent actions and a distinct voice. Her quiet determination is well-portrayed, though slight ambiguity in her "oracle" role could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution could be slightly more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and thematically rich, with evocative sensory details (e.g., the hum of choir practice, frayed cuffs). Atmosphere perfectly supports the story's melancholy yet hopeful tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (cuffs as mnemonic devices) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with a masterful balance of "show" over "tell."</comment>
