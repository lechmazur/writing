<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation is clear and compelling; his honesty and defiance feel organic. His "voice" is distinct through actions rather than dialogue, but the lack of deeper introspection slightly limits impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The method (bottles/knots) drives the conflict elegantly, though the elders' capitulation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—swamp and fortress are vividly woven into the narrative. Sensory details (reeds, mist, ironwood) deepen the mythic tone without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottles as rebellion, swift as time) and a haunting ending elevate this. Minor quibble: theme of erasure could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (mushroom-cap secrets). No clichés; only flaw is a hint of over-poeticism in the swamp's personification.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful cohesion of elements. The length feels intentional, leaving a resonant question: Who else might decode the bottles?</comment>
