<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elric's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions aligned to his desire for truth. His 'voice' is distinct, but his recklessness could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the drone's sudden transformation feels slightly rushed. The arc is complete, though the tight word limit shows.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is vivid and enhances the story. Sensory details (burnt ozone, flickering light) are immersive and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought.</comment>
