<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's naivety and motivation are clear, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt. Her voice is distinct, but deeper internal conflict could elevate her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The shard's role as a catalyst is logical, though the scribe's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The "peculiarly virtual" glow feels slightly dissonant with the ancient runes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shard as seed) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of naivety as soil could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors, though the "virtual" element feels slightly forced. Tone is consistent, and the writing avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers with quiet promise, though deeper thematic resonance would strengthen it.</comment>
