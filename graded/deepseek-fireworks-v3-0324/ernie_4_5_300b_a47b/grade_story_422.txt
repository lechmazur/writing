<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lila's selectively mute nature and ventriloquism are deeply integrated into her character, revealing her emotional depth and resilience. Her motivation to archive weather patterns as a metaphor for familial silence is poignant and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with overheard phone calls driving thematic revelations. The arc from observation to action (approaching the lighthouse keeper) feels organic and satisfying within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach, with its neon tides and shattered mirrors, creates a hauntingly vivid atmosphere that amplifies the story's themes. Sensory details (e.g., salt-kissed wind, trembling cardboard) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (weather patterns, mirrors) and subtext. The ending redefines "family" with audacity, leaving a lasting emotional impact. Dialogue (through Finn) is purposeful and revealing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("Family = Accidents + Audacity"). Avoids clich√©s; emotions are shown through nuanced reactions (e.g., Finn's twitching, Lila's breath hitching).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme lingers. A standout piece with depth and stylistic confidence.</comment>
