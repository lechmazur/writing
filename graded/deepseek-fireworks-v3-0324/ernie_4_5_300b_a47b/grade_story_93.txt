<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is immersive, with evocative sensory details (emergency lights, static, fogged glass) enhancing the atmosphere. The archive and labyrinth settings are meaningfully connected to the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of cards as mirrors, fractal equations as hieroglyphs) are used masterfully. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of 'unspoken bonds' resonates deeply. Subtext enriches every layer.</comment>
