<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's ambition and herbalist background are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "relentless drumming of 'not enough'" could be more subtly woven into her inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the storm and lockdown serving as effective catalysts. The resolution feels earned, though the maintenance shaft discovery borders on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bunker's sterile atmosphere contrasts sharply with the greenhouse's vitality, enhancing Lirael's rebellion. Sensory details (cold metal, damp earth) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (clothespin, storm) and a resonant theme of self-liberation elevate the story. The ending lingers with emotional and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the subversion of the "herbalist in a lab" trope. The clothespin as rebellion is fresh, though some phrases ("concrete womb") edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for subtext without sacrificing clarity or impact.</comment>
