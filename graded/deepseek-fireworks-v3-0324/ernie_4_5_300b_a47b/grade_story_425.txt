<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's morose demeanor and latent heroism are well-developed, with clear motivation shifting from brooding to action. His use of the sewing needle subtly reveals his deeper, mending nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced within constraints, though the fissure's threat feels slightly rushed. The blackout and chance encounter logically drive the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory's lavishly austere atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cold stone, eerie fissure glow) enhancing tension. The setting amplifies the stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (needle as precision/mending) and subtext (duty vs. adaptability). The ending is satisfying, though Elara's laughter feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
