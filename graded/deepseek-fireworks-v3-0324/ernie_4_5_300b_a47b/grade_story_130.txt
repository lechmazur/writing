<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's arc from lost apprentice to self-accepting traveler is compelling and well-supported by his actions and dialogue. His sarcasm-turned-armor is a standout character trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically tight, though the cordless phone device feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent vines and pulsing fruit amplifying the story's mood. Sensory details are exceptional.</comment>
