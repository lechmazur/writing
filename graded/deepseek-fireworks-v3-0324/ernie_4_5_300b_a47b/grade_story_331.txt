<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira’s reserved nature and secret rebellion are well-developed, her motivation clear and consistent with her traits. Her trembling hands and quiet laughter reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot progression is tight and logical, with the music box as a catalyst. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The garden’s quantum entanglement is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming petals, starlight bats) enhancing its surreal atmosphere. Setting and action are perfectly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (music box as time’s heartbeat) and subtext (defiance vs. preservation). The ending lingers, though the conflict with elders could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotion (Lira’s "restraint cracking") and fresh metaphors ("weeping willow drank from the river of probability") stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the garden’s quantum logic feels deliberate. Leaves the reader pondering evolution vs. tradition.</comment>
