<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and compelling, but his overzealous nature occasionally feels overstated, bordering on caricature. His "voice" is distinct, though his mania could benefit from more nuanced layers.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is coherent, with a strong arc, but some transitions (e.g., the woman’s sudden appearance) feel abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the orchard’s eerie glow and shifting layout enhancing the story’s mythical tension. Sensory details are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (notebook, orchard) and subtext. The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous, though the thematic depth could be slightly sharper. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The prose is vivid but occasionally overstylized ("static of forgotten frequencies"). Emotional resonance is subtle but present.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the mythological framework could be tightened further for full impact.</comment>
