<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The envoy's sneering demeanor and "furiously tranquil" attribute create a compelling contradiction, but his hunger and ambition could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled, with the note and glowing roots escalating tension logically. Pacing is sharp, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere: the alien vineyard's decay and metallic sharpness immerse the reader. Sensory details (crunching glass, violet glow) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (starlight, paper trails) and evocative prose, but the envoy's laugh feels jarring. Theme of hubris versus warning is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and eerie, with fresh metaphors ("skeletal fingers," "rambling destiny"). No clich√©s, though "shattered glass" laugh verges on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. The word limit feels deliberate, leaving haunting questions about the vines' nature and the envoy's fate.</comment>
