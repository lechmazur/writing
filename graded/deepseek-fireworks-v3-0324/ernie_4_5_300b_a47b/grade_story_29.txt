<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's "cleverly naive" trait is compelling but could be deepened; his motivation is clear but risks oversimplification in the face of complex emotions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with coherent cause-and-effect, but the resolution feels slightly rushed given the weight of the conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the jigsaw edge's role borders on contrivance. The ending resonates beautifully.</comment>
