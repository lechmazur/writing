<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, blending survival with emotional ties to his sister. His actions align well with his "logically emotional" attribute, though his "blameless smuggler" backstory could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the key and countdown driving urgency. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with sensory descriptions (jasmine, mildew) enhancing the gallery's eerie tension. The setting supports Kael's quest perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key, whispers) and subtext (survival vs. memory). The ending is purposeful, though the conflict with guards feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining survival with familial bonds, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly poetic ("grandiose modesty"), but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the smuggler angle feels underutilized. The story lingers emotionally, proving its depth beyond the word limit.</comment>
