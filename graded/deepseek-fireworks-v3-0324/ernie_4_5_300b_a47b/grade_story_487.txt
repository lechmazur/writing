<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's duality as a docile bruiser with a poet's heart is compelling, but her motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract, requiring tighter grounding in her past or immediate stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic holds, but the labyrinth's shifting corridors and abrupt resolution of raising "silence" (vs. the dead) risks confusing causality. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory detail (sap-dripping jaws, glass shards), though the drum solos' purpose could be sharper to fully synergize with the flora's behavior.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (baton as prayer stick, blackened roses) and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the ending's thematic pivot to silence feels slightly abrupt, needing more foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blending of mythic and grotesque elements (serpent-tongued gardener, skeletal roses). Lira's voice avoids cliché, though the "wall of muscle with a poet’s heart" trope skirts familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ambitious and cohesive despite dense elements. The baton's twist resonates, but the myth-making theme could be more sharply contrasted against literal "mud" for full impact.</comment>
