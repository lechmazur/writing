<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is vivid and poetic, though her backstory remains sparse. Her actions align with her goal, but deeper nuance in her personality could elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tense, but the gravity-shift mechanic feels underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the ending slightly rushes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is rendered with striking sensory detail, and the atmosphere amplifies Veyra's lethal grace. "Borrowed starlight" ties setting to tone masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (camera lens, dawn) and razor-sharp prose create impact, but the senator's demise leans slightly on contrivance. Theme of light/thievery resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphors ("laughter like shattered glass") and Veyra's idiosyncratic voice. Only minor over-reliance on "trembling" as a descriptor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the "unforgiving road" motif feels tacked on. The brevity serves the story's intensity perfectly.</comment>
