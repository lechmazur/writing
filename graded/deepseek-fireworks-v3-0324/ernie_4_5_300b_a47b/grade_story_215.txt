<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, blending science and mysticism effectively. Her "inwardly social" nature clashes well with her guarded professionalism, though her "coy aggression" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with puzzles driving the action logically. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The psychic facility and dance lessons create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the postcard’s frayed edges, the organ’s note) are evocative and grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the séance room as symbolism) deepen the theme. The ending is satisfying, though some dialogue leans toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending science and the paranormal. Minor clichés (skeptical scientist trope) are offset by fresh twists (e.g., ectoplasm as evidence).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering question about the "veil" between worlds.</comment>
