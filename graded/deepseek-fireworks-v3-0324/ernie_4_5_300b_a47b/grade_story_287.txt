<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending science and dreamer traits effectively. Her stubborn optimism drives her actions, but her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed with logical cause-and-effect. The word limit is well-managed, though the holographic reveal slightly stretches believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (damp parchment, iron scent). The library's atmosphere enhances mystery and supports the character's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative use of literary devices (symbolism, imagery). Ending feels purposeful but slightly rushed. Theme of connection is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the 1920s cellphone and solar-cycle mystery. Minor clich√©s ("whispered promise") but overall fresh and engaging.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Leaves a lingering curiosity about the father's fate.</comment>
