<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is compellingly flawed, with clear motivation and subtle transformation. His "apologetic thug" persona and rational subjectivity are well-integrated, though his dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s reliance on staged coincidences stretches plausibility, but the arc from guilt to tentative hope is coherent and well-paced for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is brilliantly evoked, merging atmosphere with theme. Sensory details (crackling sculptures, humming air) elevate the setting beyond gimmick.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (the slat as bridge/talisman) and subtext about resilience. Ending is satisfying, though Elara’s dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "letting the light in" for resilience). Avoids clichés, though Marcus’s backstory edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully woven. The garden’s static energy and crate slat enrich rather than constrain. Lingers on redemption’s fragile hope.</comment>
