<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's dual motivation (mentor's theory and personal guilt) is clear and compelling, but her "bleary-eyed" attribute feels slightly underutilized beyond initial description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect logic is tight, and the cutlass-to-elixir arc resolves elegantly. Pacing is brisk but not rushed—impressive for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nomad camp and temple breathe atmosphere, with sensory details (steam, salt, starlight) amplifying mood. Only the "digital nomad" label clashes slightly with the mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (cutlass, spiral) and subtext (unfinished business as healing). The ending’s emotional payoff feels earned and lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending archaeology and medical guilt, though "coffee ground divination" risks cliché. Prose avoids purple excess while remaining vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive, theme-rich narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reader reflection.</comment>
