<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ms. Veyra's alien identity and teacher disguise are intriguing, but her motivations could be deeper. The protagonist's fear is well-portrayed but lacks fuller exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the climax feels slightly rushed. The tile's role is clear, though the organ's impact on fear could be more explicitly linked.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bathhouse and organ create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (sound, stone) are evocative, though scent and touch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (tile as mirror) and thematic depth, but the ending’s emotional payoff could linger more. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (tenderness as a blade). Avoids clichés, though the alien twist risks trope territory. Nuanced handling of fear.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the organ’s role feels underutilized. Leaves a resonant question about fear’s legacy, though the bathhouse’s transformation could be more integral.</comment>
