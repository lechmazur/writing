<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent; her cosmic powers and academic wildness shape her rebellion against the factory's rigid expectations. Her actions align well with her established traits, and her distinct voice emerges through her internal dialogue and choices.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the brooch ritual driving the narrative forward logically. The story achieves a clear arc—beginning with Mara's dissatisfaction, climaxing with her defiance, and resolving with her transcendence. Pacing is effective, and cause-and-effect relationships are strong.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is immersive and evocative, with the factory's oppressive atmosphere contrasting beautifully with the cosmic revelation. Sensory details (ozone, rust, starlight) enhance the mood, and the gargoyle-guarded terrace serves as a powerful symbolic threshold.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using rich metaphors (gears as ancient gods, starlight bridge) and layered symbolism. The ending is satisfying and purposeful, leaving room for reflection. Theme and subtext—rebelling against constraints—are woven seamlessly into the narrative.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and formulaic writing, offering fresh imagery and emotional resonance. Mara's internal conflict feels nuanced, and the cosmic twist subverts expectations. The prose is vivid without being overly ornate.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The combination of cosmic and industrial elements is inventive, and the lingering impact—Mara carving a new path—suggests depth beyond the immediate plot.</comment>
