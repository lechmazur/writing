<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's aloofness and emotional guardedness are well-developed and consistent, with her gradual softening feeling earned. Her motivation—transforming fear into courage—is clear but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the gravitational anomaly serving as an effective metaphor. The ending resolves cleanly, though the anomaly's mechanics could be more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garage's eerie, cluttered atmosphere is vividly rendered, and the gravitational anomaly enhances the mood. Sensory details (e.g., the humming note, warm stones) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stones, anomaly) and subtext ("let go or break"). The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable. Emotions are shown effectively through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The anomaly and stones feel fresh, though Clara's arc leans on familiar tropes of emotional repression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, well-crafted story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
