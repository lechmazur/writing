<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jora's motivation is clear but her transformation feels slightly rushed. Her "genuinely fake" attribute is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the supernatural twist feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the climax could use more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The bread box's connection to the setting is clever but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bread box, kelp) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of "utopia's cracks" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoid clich√©s, though the "dance with the unknown" metaphor edges toward familiarity. Nuanced handling of emotion elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements feel slightly forced. The brevity works, though deeper exploration would strengthen impact.</comment>
