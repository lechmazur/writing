<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Finn’s motivation is clear, but his "gracefully awkward" attribute feels underdeveloped. His distinct voice and resolve save the score.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with strong cause-effect logic, but the climax feels slightly rushed. The coded letter’s role is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative setting and atmosphere, with sensory details (candlelight, grinding bone laughter) enhancing the ossuary’s eerie contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong subtext and literary devices (symbolism of the knife), though the ending’s ambiguity slightly weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors ("laughter like grinding bone"), though the "harsh tenderness" tone wobbles in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the brief length slightly undermines thematic depth. Lingers provocatively nonetheless.</comment>
