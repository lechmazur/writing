<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's swindler persona and Elias's guarded caretaker role are compelling and distinct. Motivations are clear but could delve deeper into their emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the "magnetized" concept driving revelations. Pacing is excellent, though the underground reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative world-building blends decay and rebirth. The orchard's false history and the skyscraper's secrets are richly intertwined, though more sensory detail would heighten immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (price tag, seedling) and subtext (truth vs. lies) are masterful. The ending is poignant, though Lira's internal shift could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("steel bones draped in blossoms"). Minimal clich√©, though "timid firefly" verges on generic. Emotion is shown through action, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, leaving a lingering question about reclaiming truth. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
