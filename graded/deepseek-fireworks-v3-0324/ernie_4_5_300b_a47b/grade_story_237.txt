<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her "proudly humble" demeanor adds depth. Her psychic abilities and genealogist role are underutilized, but her actions align well with her quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Mara's dice-rolling, though the diaries' connection to space pirates feels slightly forced. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked—the brig’s bruise-like light and derelict trains enhance the mood. Sensory details (e.g., the die’s chip) are deftly used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, diaries) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. Dialogue is natural, but some metaphors ("stitching together the tapestry") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending psychic genealogy with space piracy. The tone avoids purple prose, though the "puzzle of destiny" theme risks familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the psychic aspect could be more integral.</comment>
