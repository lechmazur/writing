<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Cedric's dejection is palpable, but his transformation into a "pilgrim of deepening horizons" lacks deeper introspection. His motivation is clear but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly, with the trident prong and forgotten paths driving the narrative. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the climax's cosmic shift could use more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The zero-gravity hall and sacred disorder create a mesmerizing, otherworldly atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the trident’s glow, the clock’s dissonant chime) are vividly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the prong as a key) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the emotional resonance of Cedric’s vow could be deeper. The ending is striking but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (stars like dervishes) and no clichés. The tone is consistent, though the "normally abnormal" concept edges toward overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, but the horizon metaphor could be more fully integrated.</comment>
