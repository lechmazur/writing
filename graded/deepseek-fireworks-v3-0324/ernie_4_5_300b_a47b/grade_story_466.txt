<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation and morally ambiguous nature are well-developed, driving her actions consistently. Her "connoisseur of forgotten things" trait is vividly portrayed, though her 'cunning' aspect could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the xerographed seeds and tower climb creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the grocery setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original, with sensory details (burnt sage, rust) enhancing the surreal tone. The tower and seeds intertwine meaningfully with Clara’s quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (seeds as language, smoke as transience). The ending’s thematic punch ("destiny is a verb") lingers. Literary devices are deftly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. Fresh metaphors (sky like "spoiled milk"), nuanced emotion, and no clichés. Style is distinct, avoiding AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth.</comment>
