<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's softhearted nature feels authentic and motivates his defiance of authority to protect Lira. His midnight ritual adds depth but could be explored further to solidify his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the belt buckle serving as a clever hinge between mystery and cosmic revelation. Pacing is strong despite the word limit, though the Corpo threat could be clearer earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk-police station and planetarium contrast brilliantly, with sensory details (neon haze, residual energy) enhancing atmosphere. Only minor tweaks would make the setting feel even more lived-in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cosmic equations as scars) and a resonant theme of organic resilience elevate the story. The ending slightly rushes Lira's return, but the emotional payoff is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of cyberpunk and cosmic mysticism avoids clich√©s. Some phrases ("whispered of a life interrupted") verge on purple, but overall, the voice feels distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively into a thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, though the Corpos' motives could use more nuance to match the story's thematic depth.</comment>
