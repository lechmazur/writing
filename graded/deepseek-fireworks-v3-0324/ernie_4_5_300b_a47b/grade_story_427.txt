<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Veyra are vividly distinct, with mechanical and fractured traits driving their debate. Their motivations—deconstruction vs. equilibrium—are clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sock’s arrival and disintegration create a tight arc, but the applause feels underutilized. Pacing is strong, though the tunnels’ introduction is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s decay and dawn’s fragile light amplify the thematic tension. Sensory details (sparks, frayed threads) are potent but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (dream-weaving vs. chaos) and striking metaphors (sock as loom) elevate the story. The ending’s quiet revelation lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (arm as weaver) avoid clichés. Only minor stiffness in Veyra’s dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, though the applause’s role is vague.</comment>
