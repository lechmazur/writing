<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rook's "strongly weak" paradox is compelling, but his internal conflict could be sharper. His motivation is clear, though his voice lacks distinctness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a satisfying arc. The levitation revelation elevates the climax, but the "between games" timeframe slightly muddies cause/effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The liminal Celtic village is vividly atmospheric, blending digital and mystical decay. Sensory details (static, peat) are exceptional, though the oak's sacredness could be deepened.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich subtext ("jubilant despair," ink pot as galaxy) and a resonant ending. Some metaphors verge on overworked (spiderweb storm). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the palimpsest twist. "Strands of courage" risks cliché but is redeemed by gravity-defying execution. Nuanced emotion, though Rook's trembling feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered gem. The ink pot’s role as both relic and plot device is masterful. Leaves a lingering question: Is courage weight or wings?</comment>
