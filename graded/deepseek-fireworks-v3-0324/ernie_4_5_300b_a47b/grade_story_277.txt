<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "unsure" trait could be more deeply explored in her actions. Her transformation is compelling but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc. The labyrinth metaphor ties nicely to the theme, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the writing style elevates the narrative. Minor redundancy in "fractured beauty."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though the "golden age" framing is somewhat familiar. Emotional resonance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated. The story feels deliberate and leaves a lingering impact. Slight over-reliance on the labyrinth motif.</comment>
