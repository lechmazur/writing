<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a compelling, nuanced character whose ghost-seeing ability and profession merge intriguingly. His motivation ("liberation in letting go") is clear and drives his actions, though some transitions between ghost interactions and lab work could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced for the word limit, with a clear arc from conflict (ghost’s plea) to resolution (crown’s disintegration). The sandcastle lab motif could be better woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative (salt, regret, humming machines), though the sandcastle lab’s connection to the ghosts feels slightly underutilized. Sensory details immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crown, sandcastles) and subtext (silence as "container for everything unsaid"). Ending resonates, though the ghost’s resolution could delve deeper emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The "elegantly clumsy" phrasing risks overuse, but the story’s voice and emotional nuance feel authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the sandcastle lab’s role could be tighter. Lingers thoughtfully on impermanence and freedom.</comment>
