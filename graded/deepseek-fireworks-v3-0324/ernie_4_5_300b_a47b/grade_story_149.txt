<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias' transformation from janitor to prophet is compelling, though his rebellion feels slightly performative rather than deeply rooted. His motivation to unify minds is clear but could benefit from more internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and achieves resolution, but the glimmering transitions feel abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the laundromat detour slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The giant’s study is vividly atmospheric, a perfect liminal space. Sensory details (dust-choked air, moth-eaten velvet) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flower, hourglass) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though Mara’s shift in tone lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors ("cathedral of forgotten things"). Avoids clichés, though the prophet trope skirts predictability. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the laundromat scene feels ancillary. The brief length suits the story’s contemplative nature, leaving a lingering question about Elias’ role.</comment>
