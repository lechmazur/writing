<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is vividly clear, blending repulsive attraction with a poignant quest for truth. Her mechanical nature and emotional depth create a compelling dissonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's structure is tight, with a clear arc from gathering fragments to the mirror's revelation. Pacing is effective, though the ending's abstraction slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and river of stars are breathtakingly original, with bioluminescent moss and liquid starlight enriching the atmosphere. Sensory details are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "exultant grief") and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is haunting but slightly too cryptic for full impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lush but purposeful, with fresh metaphors ("a rumble of gears and sorrow"). Emotional resonance is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the abstract timeframe ("infinity") slightly strains logic. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache.</comment>
