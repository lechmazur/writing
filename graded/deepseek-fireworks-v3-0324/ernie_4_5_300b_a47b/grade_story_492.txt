<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's motivation is clear and poignant, his actions align with his "normally weird" traits, and his sister's plight adds emotional depth, though his "distracted" nature could be more consistently shown.</question>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and effective pacing. The infiltration arc feels complete, though the escalator metaphor slightly overshadows the climax.</question>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk alley is vividly rendered with sensory details (ozone, neon grime). The juxtaposition of blacksmith tools and holograms enriches the setting, though the "standstill" metaphor could be subtler.</question>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stitching light, fractured illusions) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but the "ruthless kindness" tone occasionally clashes with the softer themes.</question>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and inventive, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases verge on flowery ("ruthless kindness"), but the voice avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</question>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, though the escalator motif could be more integrated.</question>
