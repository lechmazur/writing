<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's role as a chef and mediator is well-defined, but Kael's backstory lacks depth. The music box's impact on both characters is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent for the word count, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere meshes perfectly with the themes of muted hope and reconciliation. Sensory details are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stew as a bridge, the box's vibration) and a resonant theme elevate the story. The ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "calm frenzy" tone occasionally feels strained. The handling of muted sound is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant story that justifies its brevity. The elements serve the narrative rather than constrain it.</comment>
