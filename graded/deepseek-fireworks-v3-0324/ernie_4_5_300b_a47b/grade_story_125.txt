<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s underachieving nature and conflicted heritage are well-developed, but her motivation to "spring a trap" on herself feels slightly forced. Her voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. The misdelivered package drives the story effectively, though the space station setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid with sensory details, but the abandoned space station and farmland clash tonally. The doll head’s connection to the setting is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (violet magic, star-weaving) and a satisfying ending. The theme of reclaiming heritage is poignant but slightly overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but "exceptionally usual" feels repetitive. The emotional resonance is nuanced, though the tone shift from "bored excitement" to resolve is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the space station feels like a missed opportunity. The brevity works, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
