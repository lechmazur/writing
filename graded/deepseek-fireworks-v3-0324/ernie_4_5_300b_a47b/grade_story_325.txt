<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hector Vrynn's eccentricity is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "comically serious" demeanor and obsession with carnivorous flora enrich his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Hector's experiment, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The high-altitude tea house and ionized atmosphere are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (humming static, snapping orchid) enhancing the eerie, whimsical mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in the belt, subtext in the barista's loyalty) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The carnivorous orchid and "subharmonic light frequencies" showcase ingenuity, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, with creative integration (teapot projector, ionized tea). The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about genius vs. madness.</comment>
