<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>K-42's motivation to archive human stories is clear and poetic, but the child Lila's impact feels underdeveloped despite her linguistic innovation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured, with K-42's retreat and lantern-following method serving a clear arc, though the desert climax lacks tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story transcends its elements cohesively, leaving a lingering meditation on preservation and ephemerality.</comment>
