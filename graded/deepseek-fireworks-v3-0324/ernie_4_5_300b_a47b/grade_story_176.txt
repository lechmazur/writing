<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jinx's apathy and gradual emotional thaw are compelling, but his transformation feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the map, though the hologram resolution leans on convenience. Pacing is strong for the length.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent garden is vividly rendered, and the surreal atmosphere amplifies the emotional stakes. Mushroom glow as a metaphor for insight is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (barbed wire arms, lantern metaphor) and subtext, though the hologram's message borders on didactic. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "hum of insight"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "apathetic jester" archetype slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the tension between cynicism and connection.</comment>
