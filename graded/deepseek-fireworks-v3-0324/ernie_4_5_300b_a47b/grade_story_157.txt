<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, with his obsession with the ancestors driving his actions. His "absurd solemnity" adds depth, though some nuances of his puppeteer background could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with rain patterns and the ring spiraling into a satisfying reveal. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (dust, crumbling cliffs) enhancing the mood. The rain-as-language motif is particularly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ring, journals) and lyrical prose elevate the story. Theme of cyclical history resonates, though the ending’s impact could be slightly sharper.</comment>
