<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation is clear and poetic, his actions align with his quest, and his nostalgic reflection adds depth. However, his 'voice' could be more distinct given the limited dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the greenhouse mechanism's discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The desert and ruins are vividly rendered, with sensory details (heat, rust, light) that heighten atmosphere. The setting amplifies both the quest’s stakes and the theme of repair.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cracks as guides, light as catalyst) and a resonant theme elevate this beyond the surface plot. The ending lingers, though the conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, avoiding clichés. The "canvas of life" metaphor feels fresh, and the prose balances precision with evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere seamlessly, serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression of renewal.</comment>
