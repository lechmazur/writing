<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the climax (the fleet's arrival) feels slightly rushed. The connection between the record and the chimes is inventive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (glowing rivets, wind chimes) amplifying the atmosphere. The recycled spaceship and centuries-long wait enrich the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("songs mapping migration patterns") and resonance. The ending is poignant, though the AI's dialogue borders on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("savage grace") feel slightly forced. The emotional core, however, is authentic and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though a touch more thematic subtlety would perfect it.</comment>
