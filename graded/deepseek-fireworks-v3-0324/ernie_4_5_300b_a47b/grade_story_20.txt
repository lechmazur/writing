<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's disappointment and resolve are vividly portrayed, with the comb serving as a powerful symbol of her past and motivation. Her voice is distinct, though her shift from disinterest to purpose could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bridge and waterfall serving as potent metaphors for regret and defiance. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial dance create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (comb's bite, mist) deepen immersion, though the roadside attraction feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (comb as map, bridge as regret) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the transition from disinterest to resolve could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "chronicle revolutions with arrows"). Minimal clich√©s, though "bridge of regret" leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative that thrives within constraints. Elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
