<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's late-blooming heroism is nuanced, with clear motivation rooted in loss and a distinct voice. His actions align with his resolve, though some emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from resistance to revelation. The spyglass as a catalyst works, but the attic search feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and smog-choked sky are vividly rendered, with sensory details elevating the atmosphere. The setting reinforces the story's themes of fragility and stewardship.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spyglass as key) and subtext (ghosts as blueprints). The ending is purposeful, though the elders' shift in attitude could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is evocative without being purple, and the cosmic balance theme feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively; the brief length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about stewardship and loss.</comment>
