<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's shift from fact-mindedness to empathy is compelling, though her "desperately casual" trait could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with empathy-driven logic replacing spatial navigation smoothly. Pacing is strong for the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere beautifully; brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting thematic echo.</comment>
