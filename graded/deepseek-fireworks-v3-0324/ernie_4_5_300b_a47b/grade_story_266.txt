<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clown's motivation is vivid and consistent, his grotesque charisma and destructive poetry reveal depth. His voice is distinct, though his backstory remains oblique.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the clown's dismantling of illusions drives the arc, though the hermits' collapse feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating studio and mist-choked valley create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (spores, metallic whine) are masterful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The bleak clown's voice and jagged tone defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce compellingly; the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a haunting, thematic aftertaste.</comment>
