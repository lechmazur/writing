<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the karaoke duet slightly strains believability. The hourglass motif ties the arc together neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the hourglass's literal mechanics feel underdeveloped. Atmosphere enhances the emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sharpener, hourglass) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the confession’s emotional impact could be deepened.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the hourglass setting feels more decorative than integral. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
