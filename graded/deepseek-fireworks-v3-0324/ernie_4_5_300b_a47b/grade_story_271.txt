<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mordecai's motivation is clear and hauntingly consistent with his morbid persona, and his "voice" is distinct. Lira's ghostly presence adds depth, though her backstory could be slightly more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the centrifuge action, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is masterfully evoked with sensory details (e.g., "spices," "ghostly whir"). The setting amplifies the eerie tone and Mordecai’s defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (e.g., "skeletons caught mid-dance") and subtext about grief elevate the story. The ending resonates, though Lira’s exit could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and originality shine, avoiding tropes. Nuanced emotions ("defiant compassion") and stylistic flair defy AI genericness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce inventively, and the length feels deliberate. Lingers on themes of absurdity and liberation, though the ruler’s straightening feels abrupt.</comment>
