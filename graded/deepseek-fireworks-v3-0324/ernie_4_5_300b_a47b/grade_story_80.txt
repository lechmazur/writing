<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, her "ingeniously clueless" nature shines through actions and dialogue, but her backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the climax's resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly immersive, with sensory details (rusted rails, screaming books) elevating the eerie tone. Setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (symbolism of the doorknob, fragmented mirrors). Theme of embracing uncertainty is poignant and subtly reinforced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("quiet mania") verge on overused. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. Lingering question of Lira's next adventure underscores depth. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
