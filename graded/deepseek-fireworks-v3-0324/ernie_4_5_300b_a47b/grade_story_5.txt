<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s guarded nature and motivation to preserve ancient wisdom are clear and consistent. Her actions with the amulet and seashell reveal her resilience and curiosity, but her “voice” could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the amulet’s nightmares driving the action logically. The ending feels purposeful, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The power plant setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details (humming amulet, crushed moonstone) immerse the reader, though some descriptions border on overworked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shell as talisman) and layered themes (atonement, memory) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, but the “pensive mirth” tone isn’t fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clichés. The amulet’s nightmares and Elowen’s method feel fresh, though occasional phrases (“storm-tossed waves”) verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression of resilience and legacy.</comment>
