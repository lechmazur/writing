<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s tight structure, driven by the recipe and subtitles, achieves a clear arc despite brevity. Pacing is masterful, though the TV’s突兀 presence briefly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (myrrh, heat) and the fading photograph. The palace blends seamlessly with the story’s mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (sepia memories) and symbolism (recipe as key). The ending’s emotional resonance lingers, and themes of truth/perception are layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the story transcends its constraints. Leaves a haunting question about truth’s cost.</comment>
