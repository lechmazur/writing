<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's bookish assassin persona and ink-stained fingers create a vivid contrast with his lethal profession. His motivation—establishing a new order—is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration of his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of cyclical completeness, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships feeling underexplored, particularly the station's sentience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frequency monitoring station is rendered with evocative sensory details (static, ozone), and its decaying, labyrinthine nature enhances the mournful elation of Kael's mission. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the key cover as a brand) and subtext (silence vs. legacy), but the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. The thematic depth is promising but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "fractured mirrors" simile is borderline cliché. The rubber key cover and cyclical nightmares feel fresh, and the tone avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the "new order" concept could be more concretely realized to amplify lingering impact.</comment>
