<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zephyr's character is vivid and consistent, with his playful yet calculating nature and haunting backstory effectively revealed through his interaction with the seahorse plush.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The "consolidate" action drives the narrative well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coral reef city is richly rendered with evocative sensory details, and the bioluminescent atmosphere enhances the story's haunting, contradictory tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the seahorse, reversed echoes) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the thematic punch could land harder.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and perspective, avoiding clichés. The emotional nuance in Zephyr’s fleeting self-doubt elevates the prose beyond generic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creatively leverages its elements. The brevity works in its favor, leaving a lingering question about moral ambiguity.</comment>
