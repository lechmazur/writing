<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past as a priest, but some actions (e.g., jogging as a method of seeking answers) feel slightly overplayed. The abacus as a symbolic object is strong, but his "unapologetically confused" state could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The pond revelation and resolution feel earned, though the transition from jogging to kneeling is abrupt. Snow patterns as navigation could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—beanstalk orchard and "dull radiance" create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (snow, abacus clicks) immerse the reader, though the "hush of fate" could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (abacus, mirror pond) and emotional depth elevate the story. Ending is satisfying and thematic. Minor flaw: the voice from the pond slightly over-explains the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The abacus and orchard feel fresh. Only gripe: "unapologetically confused" borders on over-statement. Metaphors (snow like salt, beanstalk shadows) are vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. Length feels deliberate. Lingers on complacency and redemption. Minor deduction for the pond's dialogue being too on-the-nose.</comment>
