<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and distinct, blending her baker's craft with rebellion. Her "cynically gentle" voice and actions align well, though her depth could be slightly richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. The lunar method feels abrupt but doesn’t derail cohesion. Pacing excels within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (ozone, rust, jam) elevating the mystical garage. Shadows and clocks deepen the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about rebellion’s sweetness.</comment>
