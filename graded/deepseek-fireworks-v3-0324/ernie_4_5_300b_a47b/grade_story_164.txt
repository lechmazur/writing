<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's wistful nature and blacksmith background are well-integrated, with clear motivation (reclaiming the wild) and consistent actions. His voice is distinct, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Kael's obsession to the arcade's transformation. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cyberpunk arcade and botanical rebellion are flawlessly merged. Sensory details (neon, dust motes, vines) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dust motes as seeds, skylight as portal) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of wild vs. artificial is explored with subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "dust motes as star charts") and nuanced emotion. No AI-generated tropes or inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. A standout piece with cohesive ingenuity.</comment>
