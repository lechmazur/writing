<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s pride and sarcasm are well-defined, driving her actions consistently. Her voice is distinct, though her transition to responsibility could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight, coherent arc with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is brisk but effective for the word limit, though the shadow’s threat could use more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive worldbuilding with sensory details. The jungle setting enhances the magical tension, though the "treehouse city" could feel whimsical for the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (grimoire as responsibility) and subtext. Ending is satisfying, though the youthification twist risks gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh take on tropes (e.g., sarcasm vs. shadow). Originality shines in Lira’s voice, but some phrases edge toward cliché ("gangly teenager").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about Lira’s growth and the grimoire’s true cost.</comment>
