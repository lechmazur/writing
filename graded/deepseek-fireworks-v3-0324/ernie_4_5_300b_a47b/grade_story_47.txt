<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent; her rebellion through stolen phones and the glove reveal depth. However, her transition from dutiful ward to rebel could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The method (stolen phones) drives the plot effectively, though the chaos could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (dust, stage grease) and the sanctuary's shift from tomb to stage is masterful. The glove's connection to the setting elevates the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glove, phones) and subtext (rebellion vs. tradition). The ending is satisfying, though the director's sudden shift could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (glove as "pulse of rebellion"). Avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering thought about artistic defiance. Length feels deliberate.</comment>
