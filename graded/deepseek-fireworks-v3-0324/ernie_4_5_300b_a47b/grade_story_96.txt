<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is intriguingly murky yet crystallizes effectively when he discovers the map. His defiance and apathy are well-balanced, though his deeper fire could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the map's discovery and Jax's rebellion driving momentum. The cactus distraction is clever, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The menagerie's atmosphere is vividly surreal, with electric details (scorched hoof marks, bioluminescent toad) that immerse the reader. The setting perfectly complements Jax's restless creativity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the tear as a scar) and subtext (defiance vs. fate). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The spectral goat and sentient cactus are inventive, and Jax's voice feels distinct. A few phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic lingering.</comment>
