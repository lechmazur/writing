<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elric's faintheartedness and motivation are clear, but his "sentinel" role feels underdeveloped. His use of the ruler reveals vulnerability, but the contrast between his role and his fear could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric tension over concrete progression. The tapestry and glyphs resolve neatly, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chamber's oppressive atmosphere is richly rendered, but the dog-walking timeframe feels tangential. Sensory details (e.g., "air hummed," "scent of aged parchment") excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ruler as talisman, tapestry as labyrinth) and subtext (security as illusion). The ending lingers, though the chant’s introduction feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and vivid, avoiding clichés. The ruler’s mundanity juxtaposed with magic is fresh, though "intimately distant" verges on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity occasionally sacrifices depth for atmosphere. The ruler’s role is inventive, but the sentinel aspect feels underexplored.</comment>
