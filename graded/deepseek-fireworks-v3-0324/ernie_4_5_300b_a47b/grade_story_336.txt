<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker's weariness and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his actions clearly rooted in his hope against darkness. However, his 'voice' could be more distinct given the introspective nature of the story.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the astronomical clock's revelation driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent, and the story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly evoked, with sensory details (marble columns, incense smoke) enhancing the atmosphere. The palace and timeframe mesh seamlessly to amplify the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (light/dark, clock as a trapped heart) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the writing style elevates the story's emotional and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The handling of "placid ferocity" and "rarely practical" tribal knowledge feels fresh. Some descriptors could be more vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and leaves a lingering impact. Elements are woven organically into the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional rather than restrictive.</comment>
