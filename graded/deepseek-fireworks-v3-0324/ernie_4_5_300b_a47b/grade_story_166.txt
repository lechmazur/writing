<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's ghostly nature and solemn-silly demeanor are compelling, but his motivation to communicate with animals feels slightly underdeveloped given the stakes of fate-weaving.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with perforating logs driving the narrative forward logically. The ending resolves cohesively, though the middle could better clarify cause-and-effect between actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing moths, geyser steam) enhance the eerie yet whimsical tone brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (straw as a loom, moths as fate) and subtext elevate the story. The ending satisfies, though the theme of fate could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The plastic straw's symbolic use is inventive, though "gentle chaos" occasionally veers into tonal inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements blend seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers thoughtfully on connection, though the fate concept could be more fully explored.</comment>
