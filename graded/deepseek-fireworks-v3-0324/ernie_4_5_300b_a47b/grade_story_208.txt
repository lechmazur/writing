<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's street musician background and regrets are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His interaction with the pen reveals depth, though his shift toward humor in despair could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the "rewind" action's execution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the letter and Eli’s vision could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The postal facility’s mechanical atmosphere is masterfully evoked, enhancing the story’s mood. Sensory details (flickering lights, grinding gears) immerse the reader, though the timeframe’s metaphorical phrasing slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (pen, letters) and a thought-provoking theme of absurdity. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overused ("cosmic absurdity").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors (e.g., the pen’s "complex deception"). Nuanced emotional handling, though the "joyful despair" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite constraints. The elements serve the story, leaving a lingering reflection on time and regret. The brief length feels deliberate.</comment>
