<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's nervousness and insincerity are well-woven into his actions and dialogue, but his motivation to "escape the ordinary" could be more explicitly tied to his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the photograph and star patterns driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the tunnel's sudden appearance feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent, decaying city is vividly rendered with sensory details that amplify Alaric's isolation and longing. The contrast with the fungi field is brilliant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars, sludge-light) and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of rediscovery is subtly powerful, though the guard drone scene could delve deeper into tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("thousand restless hearts") and a distinct voice avoid clich√©s. The emotional payoff feels earned, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brevity enhances urgency. Lingers with a quiet hope that transcends the plot.</comment>
