<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a scapegoat is clear, but her transition to truth-refashioner feels slightly abrupt. Her "robustly delicate" attribute is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by cryptic clues, though the syndicate's shift from blame to truth feels underexplained. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cloud City's misty, neon-lit atmosphere is evocatively rendered, and the pneumatic tower’s decay enhances the mystery. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (washers, symbols) is effective, and the ending hints at deeper themes. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Subtext about erasure is intriguing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "mist clung to steel like a second skin"). Avoids clichés, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the library card hook feels underutilized. Short length works deliberately, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
