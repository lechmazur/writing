<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear, consistent motivation (finding lost tech). The "blatantly secretive" trait is well-integrated, though Lira's defiance feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the time-control device reveal feels abrupt. The kiss interruption is clever but slightly gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust, herbal tea, crayon scent) immerse the reader. The sanctuary setting is original but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flower, doodles) and subtext about rebellion vs. sterility. Dialogue is sharp, though the ending’s theme of "undying creativity" is somewhat overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "heart a fortress") and avoidance of clichés. The crayon-map twist is delightfully original, though the nostalgia tone occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers with its thematic depth, though the sanctuary’s relevance to the tech hunt is tenuous.</comment>
