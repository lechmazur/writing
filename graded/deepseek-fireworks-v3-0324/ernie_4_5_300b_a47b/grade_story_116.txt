<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear motivation, but his "dismayed" nature feels slightly overplayed. His obsession with boundaries is compelling, though his rationality occasionally borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the Polaroid mosaic serving as a clever resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the sky-lounge’s role feels underutilized in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is hauntingly immersive, with stellar sensory details (e.g., "vines that bloomed only when unobserved"). The sky-lounge and garden secrets harmonize flawlessly with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext, the story lingers in the mind. The ending’s "Polaroid of sound" is a masterstroke, though the lute’s reintroduction feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, with fresh metaphors ("a candle flickering in a storm"). Minor over-reliance on "endless" descriptors, but the voice is distinctively human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, though the siblings’ warning could be more integrated. Leaves a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
