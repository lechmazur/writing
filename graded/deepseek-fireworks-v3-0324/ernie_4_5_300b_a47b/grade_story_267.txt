<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, and her refusal of binary roles is compelling. Her "voice" is distinct, though some nuance could be deepened.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The anvil's role as a catalyst is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the themes. Sensory details (neon, starlight, hammering) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (anvil, threads, cats) is layered and memorable. The ending is purposeful, though the blacksmith's exposition could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "savage bliss" feels slightly forced. The prose is fresh, though a few metaphors could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with a lingering impact. The length feels deliberate, though some elements (bikes, timeframe) are underutilized.</comment>
