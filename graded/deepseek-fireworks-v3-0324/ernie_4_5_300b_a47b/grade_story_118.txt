<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>V-7's motivation is clear, and her interactions with the hive-mind therapist reveal depth. Her "uniformly peculiar" attribute is subtly woven into her actions and reactions, but her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the candle wax method driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent, and the story achieves a clear arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (metallic whine, wax, copper-lemon taste) enhancing the mood. The facility's regretful aura deepens the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of fear as a "charger plug" is memorable and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The hive-mind therapist and wax-coding method feel fresh. Nuanced handling of emotion and a consistent, distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively executed. The elements serve the story, and the brief length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of secrecy and fear.</comment>
