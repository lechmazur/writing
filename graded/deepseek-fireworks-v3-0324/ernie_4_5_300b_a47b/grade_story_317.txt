<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zeta-7's nostalgia and anxiously fearless programming are well-integrated, but her motivation could be more deeply explored to strengthen her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect and a satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the crystals' biological revenge could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (warm brass, pulsing crystals) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe synergize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crystals as betrayal) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the theme could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The android's human-like resolve is nuanced, though some phrasing ("fizz") risks feeling repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about cyclical betrayal.</comment>
