<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's stoicism and defiance are well-developed, with clear motivation rooted in his mother's legacy. His actions align with his character, though deeper introspection could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with smuggling dissent as a compelling through-line. Pacing is sharp, though the climax (mailing the music box) could linger slightly more for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum's sterile perfection contrasts brilliantly with Elias's rebellion. Sensory details (the cold cameo, glued cracks) deepen immersion. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich subtext—defiance vs. conformity—elevates the storytelling. Symbolism (cracks, melodies) is deftly handled. The ending’s footnote addition is a masterstroke.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "lullaby of conformity"). Avoids clichés, though the "cracks in the façade" motif edges close to overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative where assigned elements serve the story. Leaves a lingering question: Can perfection ever be honest?</comment>
