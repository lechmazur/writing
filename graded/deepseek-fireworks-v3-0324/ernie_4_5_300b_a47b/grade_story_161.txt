<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marla's transformation from orchardist to detective is compelling, and her sardonic glee effectively masks deeper grief. Motivation is clear but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed with a satisfying arc, though some leaps (e.g., Fibonacci spiral revelation) feel slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Holloway facility's eerie atmosphere blends perfectly with the peacock motif. Sensory details (neon buzz, rain-lashed Thursday) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (peacock tail = code) and subtext (grief as driver). Ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s. Metaphors (peacock as compass) are fresh. Emotional depth is shown, not told, though Marla's voice occasionally edges into caricature.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The story feels deliberate, layered, and lingers. Only minor nitpicks prevent a 10.0.</comment>
