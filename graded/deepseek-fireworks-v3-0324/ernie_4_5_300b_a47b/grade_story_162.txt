<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila and Elias are well-developed with clear motivations, though Elias's backstory feels slightly underexplored. Lila's gambler persona and Elias's trustworthiness are effectively woven into their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the blueprint, but the island memories' integration feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (blueprint, island) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional depth between Lila and Elias could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of harmony.</comment>
