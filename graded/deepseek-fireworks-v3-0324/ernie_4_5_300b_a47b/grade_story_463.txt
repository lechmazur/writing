<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit and motivation are clear, but his emotional depth (especially regarding Elias Voss) could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, cohesive arc with strong cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the tango's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—haunted lighthouse and salt-stained floorboards are vivid. Ghosts and gears create a perfect eerie tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (rope, dance) and subtext about tradition vs. renewal. Ending is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("Tradition’s a rope") and original voice. Minor cliché in "mend what’s broken," but overall avoids tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve the story seamlessly. Lingering theme of holding on/letting go resonates deeply.</comment>
