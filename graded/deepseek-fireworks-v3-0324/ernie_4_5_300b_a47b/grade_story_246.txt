<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, her "discreetly flagrant" nature revealed through her actions and voice. The handkerchief and letters deepen her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ritual’s mechanics could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (prismatic light, humming anomaly). The setting enhances the eerie, liminal tone and supports the curse’s cosmic scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the handkerchief, metaphor of the curse as polymer). Ending is satisfying, with layered subtext about inherited trauma.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("the curse was a polymer") and nuanced handling of emotion. Style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively, serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about silence and agency. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
