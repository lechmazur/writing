<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with the rubber key cover serving as a strong anchor. However, her "geographically challenged" trait feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond its plot utility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the feedback loop gambit slightly strains coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story leaves a haunting aftertaste of sacrifice and purpose.</comment>
