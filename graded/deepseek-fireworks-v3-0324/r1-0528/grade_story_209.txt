<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character depth, with grief and motivation intricately tied to the hairbrush. Some inconsistency in the woodsman's technical actions vs. emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent arc, but the echo-measuring method feels contrived. Short-circuit climax is effective but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Radio wave garden and water tower are vividly atmospheric, though the "final beep" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (hairbrush, monitor beep) and emotional resonance. Endingâ€™s thematic resolution is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "tangible ghost"), though some phrases verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the theme of grief. Length feels deliberate, with lingering emotional impact.</comment>
