<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, her heretic nature and childhood promise adding depth. Her actions align well with her traits, though her "enthusiastically cautious" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The temple library and stock ticker create a unique contrast that deepens the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (teddy bear, codes) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of broken promises resonates. The writing style elevates the emotional impact.</comment>
