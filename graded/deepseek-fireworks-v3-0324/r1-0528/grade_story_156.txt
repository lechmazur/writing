<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The diplomat's confusion and evolving resolve are compelling, but his motivation, while profound, feels slightly abstract. The spare key symbolism is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bird observation serving as a pivotal moment. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "liberalize" action could be more concretely tied to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, dripping water) deepening the atmosphere. The eerie yet vibrant tone perfectly complements the story's concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism (birds, key) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the "counterpoint of hearts" concept could be more explicitly woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "joyfully tragic" duality is nuanced, though the "boldly timid" tone occasionally feels overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story with inventive use of assigned elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
