<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the hopscotch cipher elegantly bridging the character's past and purpose. Pacing is masterful for the word limit—no rush, no drag.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The archive’s atmosphere is exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (aged paper, snow, dust) amplifying the tone. The setting actively shapes the revelation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the handkerchief as palimpsest, the snowflake’s symbolism, and layered themes of preservation create profound resonance. Subtle, evocative, and deeply memorable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate gem. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting, lingering question about cultural loss.</comment>
