<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, and her "bitterly optimistic" attribute shapes her actions well. The parking stub serves as a strong anchor, revealing her past and grounding her in chaos.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, though the detour feels slightly contrived. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, and pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The station’s alien flora and shifting cloud shadows amplify Elara’s fractured perception effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and a memorable premise. Ending is satisfying, though the scan's intensity could be more emotionally nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh in execution, avoiding clichés. Metaphors are specific, and the fragmented reality concept is handled with ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the short length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about perception’s malleability.</comment>
