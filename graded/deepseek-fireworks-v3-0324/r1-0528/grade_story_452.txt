<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris' softhearted nature and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his actions deeply aligned with his goal of reshaping the city's fate. His quiet, organic method reinforces his characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from decay to tentative stability. The planetarium visits and belt buckle's role are logically integrated, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is rendered with evocative sensory details (neon rain, glitching infrastructure). The planetarium's contrast with the city enhances the atmosphere and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (buckle as a key, celestial harmonics) and subtext (hope vs. fragmentation) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, with a lingering sense of quiet triumph.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("mycelium spreading beneath concrete"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told. The cosmic reweaving concept feels original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the brief length serving the story's meditative tone. Leaves the reader contemplating subtlety vs. force in change.</comment>
