<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to archive cultural practices is clear and deeply tied to his actions. Elara's commitment adds familial depth, but her character could use more distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the climax feels slightly rushed. The folklore-driven resolution is coherent and impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's eerie tone. Sensory details (rain, corroded metal) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fork, lullaby) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though Silas's sacrifice could be more nuanced in its execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blending of folklore and modern archival pursuit. Avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("desperate optimism") verge on overuse. Fresh metaphors elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the collectors' intrusion could be smoother.</comment>
