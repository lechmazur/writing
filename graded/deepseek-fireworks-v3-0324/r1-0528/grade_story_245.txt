<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's irate nature and smuggler background merge seamlessly with his motivation to find the waterfalls, creating a compelling, distinct voice. His grief and fury are palpable, driving his actions authentically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The tea-leaf reading as a pivot from rage to resolve is inventive, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The derelict spaceport and cliffs are vividly rendered, with sensory details (cracked permacrete, metallic tang) amplifying tension. The setting reinforces isolation and desperation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s cold certainty lingers, though the heart’s revolt metaphor slightly overreaches.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotions (self-loathing, vengeance) are shown, not told. The chopstick as a relic is particularly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Leaves a haunting question: will vengeance or survival define Kael’s next steps?</comment>
