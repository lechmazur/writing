<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The collector's motivation is clear and compelling, though his 'peculiar' nature could be more vividly illustrated through actions or dialogue to deepen his distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's technicality risks minor confusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Probability Mapping Center and its cosmic chaos are vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming cores, flickering constellations) enhancing immersion. The pencil's connection to the setting is ingenious.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pencil as quantum resonator) and subtext (silence as cipher). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the conflict's resolution leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The fusion of mundane and cosmic elements feels fresh, though a few phrases ("fractured grace") verge on overused lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story’s brevity amplifies its impact. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of salvaging time.</comment>
