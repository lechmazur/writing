<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's fatigue and sarcasm are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "outdance the inevitable" feels slightly abstract, though intriguing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The gallery's surreal, vanishing-point architecture and the oppressive hush create a masterfully immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the Queen of Hearts, the kaleidoscope) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though some emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The Queen of Hearts as a signature and the gallery's vanishing point are ingeniously integrated. Minor overuse of metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering intrigue.</comment>
