<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalence and motivation are deeply integrated; her "happily sad" attribute and prophetic burden create a compelling, nuanced character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coherent, with the defragmentation action driving a clear arc. Pacing is strong, though the resolution's cosmic scale slightly strains word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vivid and purposeful, with atmospheric details (cracked marbles, vacuum-sealed soil) enhancing the story's melancholic, cosmic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—rich symbolism, layered themes, and an ending that lingers. The "anti-light" imagery and Elara's dissolution are particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés. The jigsaw puzzle edges as a method for cosmic defiance is fresh, and the emotion is shown through nuanced action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious microcosm. Elements serve the story's depth, and the brief length feels like a strength, not a constraint.</comment>
