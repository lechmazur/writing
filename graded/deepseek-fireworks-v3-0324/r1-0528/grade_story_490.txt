<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris's fading caretaker role and forbidden knowledge obsession are compelling, but his sudden shift from repair to devouring archives feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the hacking sequence, while inventive, risks feeling contrived. The ending lingers effectively but the middle could tighten.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”sensory details like "ozone tang" and "glistening mudflats" immerse the reader. The setting amplifies Aris's isolation and desperation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and literary devices, though the "enthusiastic apathy" tone occasionally clashes with the visceral hunger described.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("newborn galaxy"), though some phrases edge toward purple prose. Avoids tropes skillfully.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the word limit strains the balance between Aris's introspection and the archives' grandeur.</comment>
