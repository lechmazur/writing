<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas and Pip are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Pip's "endearingly irritating" nature contrasts well with Silas's solemnity, revealing depth through their interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the "x-out" threat driving urgency. The resolution via interconnected lives feels organic, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk rooftop garden is brilliantly evoked, with sensory details (e.g., "fragrant lemon trees") grounding the contrast between organic sanctuary and neon sprawl.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the key's symbolism, Pip's "data stream" subtext, and the ending's emotional resonance elevate this beyond genre tropes. Only a hint of over-writing holds it back.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("scaled the fire escape like a hyperactive squirrel"). Minimal clich√©, though "digital death sentence" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about connection in a fractured world.</comment>
