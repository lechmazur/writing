<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's quiet intensity and late-bloomer ethos are vividly rendered, but Elara's depth feels slightly underdeveloped compared to him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive arc with tension, though the microfilm exchange’s stakes could be clearer earlier. Pacing is tight but elegant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is electric—museum as liminal space, shadows and fossils magnifying the existential weight of the characters’ mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich subtext (extinction as metaphor, unignited sparks), but the sundial’s coded angles slightly overplay their hand as a device.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with striking metaphors (e.g., "cradling the universe"), though "faithfully unfaithful" edges toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole; the matchbox and orchard dog linger after reading. Minor deduct for Elara’s abruptness.</comment>
