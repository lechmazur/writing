<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is vivid and consistent, with his defiance and ecstatic dread perfectly aligned with his actions. His 'voice' is distinct despite minimal dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prism and bridle expertly driving the climax. Pacing is masterful, and the inversion of lightning feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with the sky burial site and storm enhancing tension. Sensory details (grinding ceramite, smoldering leather) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the prism as both weapon and symbol, the bridle's resonance, and the euphoric tone create layers of meaning. The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("reflecting lightning back at the storm") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©. The prose is ornate but purposeful, avoiding purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, and the fusion of sci-fi and ritualistic mysticism is strikingly original.</comment>
