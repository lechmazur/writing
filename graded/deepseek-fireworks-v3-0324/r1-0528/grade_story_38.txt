<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The poet’s insomnia and reliance on botanical confidants create a compelling, haunted psyche. His non-violent struggle against the root’s whispers is vividly portrayed, though his drunken confession feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot’s tension builds effectively around the nightshade root, but the party scene’s transition is jarring. The resolution—choosing words over violence—is satisfying but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic’s decay and "empty abundance" are gorgeously evoked, with sensory details (dust, moonlight, nightshade’s pulse) amplifying the dread. The subway-stop silence is a standout motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (roots as secrets, verse as a shield) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s thematic payoff is strong, though the critic’s scene lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("museum of impending loss," "toxic pollen in his lungs") avoid cliché. The poet’s voice feels distinct, though the "drunken rambling" trope is somewhat trite.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The elements cohere into a haunting meditation on non-violence. The brevity serves the story, but the party scene slightly dilutes its focus.</comment>
