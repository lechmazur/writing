<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, deeply intertwined with her role as a midwife and her fragmented past. Her secretive yet open nature adds rich complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual and memory recovery forming a cohesive arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the maelstrom's threat feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard island and waxing moon create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (herbs, ash, maelstrom) elevate the mood and mirror Elara's internal chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (herbs as memory), vivid prose, and a transcendent ending. The conflict (memory loss vs. reclaimation) resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The midwife-memory connection is fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Emotional depth feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette. Elements serve the story's ethereal yet grounded tone. Leaves a lingering sense of reclaimed identity.</comment>
