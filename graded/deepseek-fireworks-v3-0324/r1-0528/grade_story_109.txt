<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is tight and cohesive, but the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly, but the mitten's reintroduction at the end feels slightly contrived.</comment>
