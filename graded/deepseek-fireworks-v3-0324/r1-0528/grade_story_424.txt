<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' devotion to deciphering universal patterns is compelling, and his motivation to understand sacrifice as inheritance is nuanced, but his zealotry could be more vividly depicted to match the "mild zealot" descriptor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically, with the scanner's revelations driving the narrative. The arc from obsession to acceptance is complete, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's rustic refinement and chaotic equations create a striking atmosphere. Sensory details like the frayed peso and glowing kwacha threads immerse the reader deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (banknotes as "paper ghosts") and layered themes (sacrifice as lattice, not wound) elevate the story. The ending resonates with quiet clarity, though a touch more subtext could deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "scars as maps") and fresh handling of legacy avoid clich√©s. Only minor patches of overly ornate prose ("oddly typical fragility") slightly disrupt flow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense narrative where elements serve the story elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on generational sacrifice.</comment>
