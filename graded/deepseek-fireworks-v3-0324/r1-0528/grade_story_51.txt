<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marco's transformation from thug to seeker of resilience is compelling, but his "rationally subjective" plan feels slightly underdeveloped. His tactile connection to the crate slat is a strong detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on coincidence (Elena's appearance). The museum staging works, though the static electricity garden's role is unclear.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vivid but underutilized. The museum atmosphere is effective, but the two settings feel disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and subtext. The apology scene is powerful, though the ending's ambiguity slightly weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "words ash in his mouth"). Avoids clich√©s, but the garden concept feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. The crate slat and resilience theme elevate the story beyond its length.</comment>
