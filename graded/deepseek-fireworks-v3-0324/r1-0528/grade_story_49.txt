<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "lukewarm mage" attribute is well-integrated, shaping her actions and internal conflict effectively. Her motivation to overcome fear is clear and consistent, though her "loyally peculiar" trait could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the fog-generated silhouettes serving as a vivid metaphor for her internal struggle. Pacing and coherence are excellent, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar base setting is evocatively rendered, enhancing the story's mood and themes. Sensory details (Earthlight, synthetic fibers) are precise and immersive, reinforcing the "charred serenity" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (fog as fear, light as hope) and subtext. The ending is resonant, and the conflict is resolved with emotional weight. Stylistically polished and impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh prose, avoiding clich√©s. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told. Minor quibble: "loyally peculiar" feels slightly forced, but the rest is distinctly human and inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with all elements serving the narrative. Leaves a lingering sense of quiet triumph. Word limit feels like an asset, not a constraint.</comment>
