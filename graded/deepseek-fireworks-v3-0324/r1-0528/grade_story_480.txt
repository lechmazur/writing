<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intriguing, blending digital and physical exploration. His "indifferent enthusiasm" adds depth, though his "quietly loud" nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the receipt's discovery, but the transition from music hall to alleyway club feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (dust, boiled cabbage) enhancing the eerie mood. The setting amplifies the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (receipt as a key) and subtext (curiosity vs. danger). The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "social media exorcist" concept is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Emotion is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively, with the receipt and alleyway club linking neatly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for intrigue.</comment>
