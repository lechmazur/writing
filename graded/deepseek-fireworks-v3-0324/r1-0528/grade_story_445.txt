<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nomad's transformation from sleepy disorientation to clarity through the masquerade is compelling, though his initial "sleepiness" could be more dynamically integrated into his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect is masterfully tight, with the barbells' repair as a symbolic pivot. Pacing is precise, though the shift to the disguise room could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of sterile tech and primal barbells creates a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cold steel, resonant *thrum*) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken pride mended through performance) and a resonant ending elevate this. The "spiritually material" motif is deftly shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of circus and espionage aesthetics, though the nomad’s archetype borders on familiar. The barbells as a metaphor for arrogance feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered fable that wears its brevity as a strength. The repaired barbells linger as a tactile metaphor beyond the narrative.</comment>
