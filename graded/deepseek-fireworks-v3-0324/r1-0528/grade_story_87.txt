<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in betrayal, but her "hyperactively serene" state could be more vividly shown through actions rather than told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot effectively uses mixtapes as a conduit for memory and catharsis, though the steampunk setting feels somewhat disconnected from the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere is richly detailed but slightly overwhelms the intimate, personal conflict. Sensory details (oil, aged wood) are strong yet could better serve the character's turmoil.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful emotional impact, with resonant symbolism (sticker sheet, mixtapes). Ending is purposeful but the hollowness of victory could be more evocatively expressed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original handling of betrayal and memory, though "savage grace" feels underutilized. Avoids clich√©s but steampunk elements occasionally distract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. Length feels deliberate, though the steampunk hall's role in the emotional arc could be sharper.</comment>
