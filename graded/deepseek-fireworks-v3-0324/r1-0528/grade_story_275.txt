<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply integrated with his actions. His "theoretically rebellious" nature shines through his quiet defiance, and his use of the flower album adds a layer of poignant depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the translation ritual driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is deliberate yet effective, and the resolution feels earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "lurid hues," "low hum vibrated through his bones") immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies the hermit's struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (weathervane as conduit, comet as destruction/creation), evocative prose, and a resonant theme of rebellion against cosmic indifference elevate this beyond surface-level storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its execution, avoiding clich√©s. The blending of cosmic and earthly scales feels innovative, and the hermit's nuanced actions defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, potent vignette. The elements serve the story flawlessly, and the ending lingers with thematic weight. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
