<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brewer's cynicism and hidden purity of motive create a compelling contrast. His actions align well with his motivation, though more dialogue could deepen his distinct 'voice'.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the mirror shard and staircase stain serving effective triggers. Pacing is tight, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (hops, rust, decay) enhancing dread. The mansion and protest backdrop synergize eerily.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, stain) and subtext (duty vs. cynicism). Ending lingers, but conflict resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s; the brewer's blend of flippancy and resolve feels fresh. Minimal AI tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity suits the tale's intensity. Leaves a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
