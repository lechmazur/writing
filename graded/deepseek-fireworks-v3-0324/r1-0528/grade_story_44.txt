<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the morphing lamp serving as a clear climax. The pacing is effective, though the transition to the studio feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid, with sensory details (hay, metallic chill) enriching the atmosphere. The space debris studio contrasts intriguingly with the ancient lamp.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in the lamp/anvil, metaphors like "space debris cathedral") are masterful. The ending resonates with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and subtext elevate the story, though "feisty" and "quietly bold" tone clash slightly. Originality shines in the fusion of traditional and futuristic elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
