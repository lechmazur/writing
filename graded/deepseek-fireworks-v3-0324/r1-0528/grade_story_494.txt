<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's arrogance and internal conflict are vividly portrayed, but his shift to selflessness feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his "doubtfully confident" aura could be deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The messenger’s intrusion is effective, but the resolution could linger a bit more on the emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and "harsh tenderness" tone elevate the atmosphere. Sensory details like "gravel crunching" and "acrid tang" are masterfully immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (phoenix, shackles) and subtext ("truth wrapped in barbs") shine. The ending is satisfying, though the wedding song’s integration could feel less sudden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but Kaelen’s archetype edges near cliché. The tapestry and "between breaths" timeframe are fresh, yet the prose occasionally verges on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. The elements serve the story well, though the brevity slightly rushes the emotional crescendo.</comment>
