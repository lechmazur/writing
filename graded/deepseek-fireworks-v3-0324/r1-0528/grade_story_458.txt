<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pilot's motivation is deeply nuanced, her decision to obliterate the Atlas revealing profound alignment with her mentor's legacy. Her tactile connection to the brass button adds emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence within constraints, with the coffee-stain vision and neural chime escalating tension logically. Pacing is tight but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport amplifies isolation; the "fractal sorrow" tone is masterfully sustained through sensory details (cold metal, chipped mug) that mirror the pilot's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (button, coffee stains) and layered themes of sacrifice/distribution. The ending's "constellation of knowledge" is both visually striking and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés. "Spiritually secular" and "fractal sorrow" feel fresh, and the library's dissolution subverts preservation tropes with ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The brevity serves the story’s existential weight, leaving the reader with lingering questions about knowledge and legacy.</comment>
