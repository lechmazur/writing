<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brother Anselm's motivation is clear and beautifully unique; his quiet, intuitive approach contrasts sharply with the storm chasers' urgency, revealing depth and consistency. His "timidly loud" nature is subtly but effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the storm's escalation mirroring Anselm's linguistic breakthrough. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the chase vehicle feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storm-chasing hangar is vividly rendered, and the contrast between its chaos and Anselm's quiet quest enhances atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., buttons' textures, storm's "song") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (buttons as constellations, storm as language) and subtext (human vs. earth's voice). The ending is hauntingly resonant, leaving the reader with a palpable sense of wonder.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and emotionally nuanced. The premise avoids clich√©s, and the prose is vivid without being purple. Anselm's method feels genuinely inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>
