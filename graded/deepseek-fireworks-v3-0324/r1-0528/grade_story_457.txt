<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlo’s motivation is clear and deeply tied to his reclusive, introspective nature. His realization about the zipper pull’s symbolism is a strong character moment, though his "side hustle" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit, but the connection between folklore analysis and the nebula setting could be sharper. Pacing is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck is vividly atmospheric, and its contrast with Arlo’s internal struggle enhances the story. Sensory details (e.g., the "cold metal railing") are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the zipper pull, the nebula) and subtext. The ending is satisfyingly thematic, though the folklore method feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases ("vibrant agony") flirt with excess. Emotional resonance is strong and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the theme. The length works, though the folklore thread could be tighter.</comment>
