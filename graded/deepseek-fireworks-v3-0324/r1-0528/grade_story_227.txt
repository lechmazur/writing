<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lysander's underdog status and magician background are well-integrated, and his motivation to decode dreams is clear, though his "drainingly invigorated" state could be explored deeper for more emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sun-tracking method and dream symbolism driving the narrative forward logically. The frozen countdown reinforces the tension, though the ending's ambiguity slightly undercuts resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered, with rich sensory details (rusted spacecraft, red dust) enhancing the atmosphere. The frozen clock amplifies the theme of suspended hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the Council's sigil, the clock) and subtext about quiet resistance. The prose is evocative, though the emotional weight of Lysander's realization could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (dream geometry as rebellion). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing ("drainingly invigorated") feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of resistance.</comment>
