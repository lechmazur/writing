<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pilot's cynical yet hopeful nature is clear and drives his actions well, but his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. The "speed dating" framing feels slightly forced, but the urgency fits the stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of fragile defiance—elevates beyond its constraints.</comment>
