<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris Thorne's motivation is compelling and deeply rooted in his erased lineage, but his "vague mystic" trait feels underdeveloped compared to his scientific facade.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the override action and attic discovery driving momentum, though the lab lockdown resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile lab and dusty attic contrast brilliantly, amplifying the story's existential tension. Sensory details (e.g., trembling compass, warped floorboards) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (compass, stars, polaroids) and subtext. The ending lingers with thematic weight, though the "hollow recklessness" could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but "discreetly flamboyant" and "hollow recklessness" verge on contrivance. The prose avoids clich√© but occasionally strains for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story, though the lab's role could be more integral to the theme of lost histories.</comment>
