<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Léa's urban foraging background and motivation to shield fragile beauty are well-developed and consistent. Her "disinterested passion" adds depth to her character, though Dubois could benefit from more nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, leveraging the performance's timeframe for urgency. Pacing is excellent, though the science fair setup feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vault setting and sensory details (yeast, dampness, light) create a vivid atmosphere. The stained-glass fragment’s interplay with the vault’s spectacle is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sapphire bird as lost craftsmanship) and layered conflict (commerce vs. preservation). Ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "borrowed radiance"). Avoids cliché, though Dubois’ charm slightly edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with brevity enhancing impact. Leaves a lingering contemplation of cultural value.</comment>
