<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's guarded yet hopeful nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to learn extinct crafts drives the narrative with clarity. Her reaction to the decoded vow reveals depth, though some nuance in her emotional shift could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly from discovery to revelation, with the decrypting method cleverly tying into the climax. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the grassroots thread feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The nano-forest is a masterclass in atmospheric worldbuilding, its synthetic beauty contrasting starkly with Lyra's quest. Sensory details (humming leaves, glyphs) immerse the reader without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyra's transformation from skepticism to resolve is powerfully shown, not told. The Weaver's indictment resonates thematically, and the ending lingers with poetic force. Minor quibble: the grassroots aspect could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in blending tech-lore with lyrical tragedy. No clichés, only fresh metaphors (e.g., "angry peace"). The prose is precise yet evocative, avoiding AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, haunting parable. The brevity serves the story’s intensity, leaving the reader with the echo of the Weaver’s sacrifice.</comment>
