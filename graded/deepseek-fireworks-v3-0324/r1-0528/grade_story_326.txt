<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her "sweetly fierce" attribute shapes her actions and dialogue well, but her backstory could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed due to the word limit. Pacing is otherwise effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, leaving a lingering thought about defiance and illusion. Style supports clarity without over-complication.</comment>
