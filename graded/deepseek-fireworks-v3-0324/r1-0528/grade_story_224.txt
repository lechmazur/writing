<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is vividly portrayed through his silent yearning and the meteorite's transformative effect, aligning well with his "openly private" nature. His actions feel organic and reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the meteorite's texture driving the minstrel's rejuvenation in a coherent arc. Pacing is deftly managed, and the ending feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The giant's dining room and rush-hour clamor create a rich, immersive contrast to the minstrel's solitude. Sensory details (meteorite's hum, ladle's warmth) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (meteorite as cosmic silence) and subtext (smallness as freedom). The ending lingers with poetic resonance, and the prose avoids overt telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés. The meteorite's texture as a rejuvenation method is fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated.</comment>
