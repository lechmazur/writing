<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation to chronicle village stories is clear and consistent, with their actions revealing quiet defiance. However, the "incognito aristocrat" aspect feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the method of bottle messages driving a coherent arc. Pacing is strong, though the "before the universe" timeframe slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere; the swamp fortress and bioluminescent fungi create a haunting, immersive world. The yarn swift and setting are deeply interconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich storytelling with potent symbolism (yarn swift as altar) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the cosmic scale slightly overshadows the humble defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("pre-creation murk"), but the voice is distinct and emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about the fate of the bottles, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
