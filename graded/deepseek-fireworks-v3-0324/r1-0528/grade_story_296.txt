<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's internal conflict and complex relationship with her past are vividly conveyed through her attachment to the broken chopsticks.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the cookbook and power outage serving as effective catalysts. The story achieves a clear arc and maintains coherence, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The submarine facility is vividly rendered, with sensory details (bioluminescence, humming lights) enhancing the oppressive yet mesmerizing atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the theme of isolation and discovery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the chopsticks, the cookbook) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the thematic depth could be teased out more explicitly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (chaos as a "dynamic mandala"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though some phrasing borders on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are woven seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with its exploration of fractured beauty.</comment>
