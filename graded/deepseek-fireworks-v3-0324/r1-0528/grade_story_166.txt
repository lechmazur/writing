<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghostly caretaker's motivation is clear and drives the narrative well, though his 'solemnly silly' nature could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the forbidden logs and the straw ritual providing a logical and compelling arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
