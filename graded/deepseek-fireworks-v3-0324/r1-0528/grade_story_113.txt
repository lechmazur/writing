<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's hesitation and quiet resilience are compelling, though her 'shyly loud' attribute could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and purposeful, with dream-hopping serving as a clever device to unify fragments of grief. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and dream-hopping machines create a haunting, evocative atmosphere that amplifies the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with potent symbolism (the plush, the tunnel's light) and a resonant, bittersweet ending that lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic despite high-concept elements. The dinosaur plush as a symbol of resilience is particularly fresh and moving.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply felt story where every element serves a purpose. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
