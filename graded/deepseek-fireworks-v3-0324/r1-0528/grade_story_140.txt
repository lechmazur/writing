<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's tortured protector role is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and emotional depth. His actions and reactions reveal a fractured soul seeking resolution, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from guilt to release. The planetarium encounter feels slightly abrupt but drives the resolution effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with evocative sensory details (the doll's crack, cloying scent) enhancing the setting's decay and tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doll as guilt, starlight as redemption) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in its blend of gothic and cosmic elements, but the "suspiciously sweet" scent and some phrasing lean slightly generic. Nuanced handling of emotion saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite word constraints, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering sense of peace and thematic weight.</comment>
