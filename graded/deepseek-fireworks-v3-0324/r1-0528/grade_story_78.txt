<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, with her late-blooming heroism and fierce need to understand the Collapse driving her actions. However, her "softly militant" attribute could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the spyglass reveal serving as a pivotal moment. Pacing is excellent, but the transition from attics to water tower feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and post-apocalyptic ruin are vividly rendered, with sensory details amplifying the atmosphere. The spyglass’s connection to the cosmic imbalance elevates the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (e.g., Orion’s "celestial wound") and emotional depth mark this as standout literary craft. The ending’s grim resolve lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the cosmic-violation twist, though "gravity of loss" straddles literal/metaphorical too overtly. Language avoids cliché but occasionally verges on over-description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on cosmic-scale themes.</comment>
