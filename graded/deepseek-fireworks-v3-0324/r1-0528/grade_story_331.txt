<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's reserved nature and clear motivation ("honestly dishonest" preservation) are compelling, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with quantum agitation and bats driving the action logically toward the resolution. Pacing is superb for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The garden’s quantum entanglement is vividly realized, with sensory details (shimmering flora, discordant chimes) amplifying the ethereal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (music box, glyphs) and a layered theme of preservation-through-manipulation elevate this beyond surface narrative. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of quantum physics and spiritual preservation avoids clichés, though some phrasing edges toward ornate ("luminescent fern").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingers on the tension between creation and erosion.</comment>
