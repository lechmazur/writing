<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's naive gambling is vividly portrayed, but his desperation could be more nuanced. His motivation is clear, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, but the ending feels slightly rushed. The connection between the candle ritual and the dock is effective but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal station and candlelit dinners create a rich, oppressive atmosphere, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances Elian's isolation and despair.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, dock) and emotional resonance. The ending is bitter but purposeful. Subtext about fate and chaos is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("crushing monotony"). The emotional depth is shown, not told, though a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of tragedy, though the dock climax slightly overshadows the candle motif.</comment>
