<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The boastful warrior's bravado and fear are well-balanced, revealing depth. His motivation to escape a fabricated reality is clear and drives his actions, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The rewire action is inventive and drives the narrative. Pacing is excellent, but the larval pops could be better integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasp's nest setting is vivid and immersive, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (tearing silk, balloon pops) are effective, though more tactile descriptions would heighten atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (nanite-laden lint) and symbolism. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of fabricated reality is explored with depth. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The juxtaposition of boastfulness and vulnerability feels human. Some phrasing ("precise madness") borders on over-polished but remains fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brief length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
