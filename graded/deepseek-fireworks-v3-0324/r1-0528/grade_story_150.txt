<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas Reed's outlaw poet persona is vividly drawn, with his motivation (curiosity warring with dread) sharply defined. His actions align with his traits, but his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dice and shifting text driving the narrative coherently. Pacing is excellent, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is a masterclass in atmospheric worldbuilding. Sensory details (gaslight glow, brass groaning) immerse the reader deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism, subtext) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of fate could be more subtly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "the dome is the lens"). Some phrases border on ornate, but the voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements seamlessly serve the story’s depth. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about destiny’s cost.</comment>
