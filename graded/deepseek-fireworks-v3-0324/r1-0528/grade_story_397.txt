<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions with a mix of cynicism and desperate hope. His "genuinely strange" compulsion adds intrigue, though his bartender background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the receipt-doodle method cleverly driving the mystery. The fireworks' timing heightens tension, though the lab phone ending feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's sterile glow and ozone scent create a haunting contrast with the bloody scalpel. Fireworks outside mirror Leo's inner turmoil—masterful atmospheric layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (scalpel, helix logo) and subtext (corporate conspiracy) elevate this beyond genre tropes. The ending’s unresolved tension lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The doodle-as-map conceit is refreshingly original. Some phrasing ("optimistic desperation") leans slightly generic, but the core concept feels uniquely executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a sharp, thematically rich whole. The word count constraint enhances urgency rather than limiting depth.</comment>
