<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and evolves believably, but his initial "borrowed valor" could be more deeply explored to enhance his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight yet effective; the time-reversal twist is logical and satisfying, though the "mended fences" resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brewery's atmosphere is richly evocative, but the "morning paper" timeframe lacks deeper integration with the setting's mystique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh take on spy tropes, though "diabolically benevolent" verges on clich√©. Originality shines in the time-reversal mechanic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the brewery's role could be more pivotal. The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
