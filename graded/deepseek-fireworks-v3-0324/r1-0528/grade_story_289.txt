<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with her intellect and emotional depth resonating through her actions and reactions to the doll. Her "brainy observer" trait is well-integrated, though her "fashionably timeless" attribute feels slightly superficial in driving her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the discovery of the doll and subsequent light-art creation forming a clear, coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the FTL travel backdrop feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is a masterful setting, blending seamlessly with the story's tone and concept. Sensory details are lush and immersive, elevating the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext, with the doll and ephemeral art echoing the theme of transience. The ending is poignant and resonant, though the "enforce" action could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is elegant without being purple, though some phrases ("awkward elegance") verge on repetitive. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thematic story where elements serve the narrative beautifully. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
