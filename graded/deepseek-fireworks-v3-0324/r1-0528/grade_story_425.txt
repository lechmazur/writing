<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Morose paladin's existential weariness and spark of purpose are compelling, but his 'voice' could be more distinct. Motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-effect, but the blackout's abruptness slightly disrupts pacing. Resolution is satisfying but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Observatory's lavishly austere atmosphere is vividly rendered, though sensory details could be richer. Setting enhances theme and action effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (needle, observatory as tomb) and subtext, but emotional resonance is muted. Ending lingers but lacks deeper thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors, but some phrasing feels overly ornate. Avoids clich√©s but leans into predictable 'rekindled purpose' arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but word limit constraints show. Leaves a haunting aftertaste, though thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
