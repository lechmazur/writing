<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's introverted nature and past as a dancer are well-integrated, but her motivation could be more nuanced. The connection between her knitting and decoding is compelling, though slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect progression. The pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The dance-to-decryption leap is original and coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The decoder's office and wasteland contrast effectively, enhancing tension. The ozone and old paper smells ground the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dance, knitting, charts) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, with emotional resonance. Shows rather than tells, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, but a few phrases verge on overly ornate. The unique blend of elements (dance, decoding) stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the narrative, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering impression of resilience and escape.</comment>
