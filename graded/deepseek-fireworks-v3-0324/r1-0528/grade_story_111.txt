<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The secret dog park is vividly realized, with sensory details (ozone, damp earth) enhancing the atmosphere. The alchemy-lab-meets-memorial contrast is hauntingly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon, water rings) and emotional depth. The ending’s bittersweet transience lingers, though the elixir’s rules could be more defined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the theme of ephemeral faith is profound.</comment>
