<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brother Ansel's doubt and desperation are palpable, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "voice" is distinct, though his motivation could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the piano/fork interaction, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the word limit constraints show in the finale.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass desert and decaying piano create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (wind, rusted strings) are masterfully employed to heighten the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork as doubt, butterfly as fragility) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The conflict between faith and magic is compelling, though the ending lacks full emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is precise, though a few phrases verge on over-ornamentation. Nuanced handling of doubt and longing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
