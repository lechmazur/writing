<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Milo's reincarnation as a goldfish caretaker is intriguing, and his guilt-driven motivation is clear, but the "tentatively fierce" attribute feels underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the transition from the recipe library to goldfish emancipation feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the forgotten recipe library adds a unique atmosphere, though its connection to the toy soldier could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (toy soldier, fish) and subtext (guilt, stagnation), but the "playful cynicism" tone occasionally clashes with the heavier themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though some phrases edge toward the overly poetic. The emotional nuance in Milo's guilt is well-handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, and the brevity feels deliberate. The ending lingers, though the doctor's chart subplot could be sharper.</comment>
