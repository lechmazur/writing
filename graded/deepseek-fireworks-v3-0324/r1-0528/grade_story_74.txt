<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's minimalist nature and aloof intimacy create a compelling contradiction, but his motivation to escape AI feels slightly underexplored given the story's depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and cohesive, with the sequence and missing joker driving the narrative forward logically. The ending resolves cleanly within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionalâ€”sterile tech and primordial sea merge seamlessly. Sensory details (salty tang, hum of simulators) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (joker as chaos, tide as fate) and a resonant, lyrical style. The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The AI Overmind subversion and chaotic escape feel uniquely human. Language is precise, not florid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
