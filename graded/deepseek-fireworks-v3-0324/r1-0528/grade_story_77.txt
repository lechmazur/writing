<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the marionette's reassembly serving as a clever metaphor for unity. The arc feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing its desolation. The starfish and marionette enrich the atmosphere, grounding Kael's epiphany.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (marionette, starfish) and subtext ("obviously hidden" connections) elevate the story. The ending resonates, though some emotional beats could be subtler.</comment>
