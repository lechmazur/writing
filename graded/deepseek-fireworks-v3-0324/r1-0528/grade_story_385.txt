<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's dual nature as a "pleasant meddler" and her obsession with decoding symbols are compelling, but her manipulation feels slightly overdrawn without deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect linking the skates, the professor’s mutterings, and the tower. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hospital and obsidian tower create an eerie contrast, but the beach connection feels underexplored. Sensory details (antiseptic, cold sand) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism (skates as tools, the tower’s mystery). The ending’s fractured clarity is purposeful and haunting. Writing elevates the tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (skates etching symbols). Avoids clichés, though Elara’s manipulation edges toward trope without full subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering unease. Only the beach’s ephemeral role slightly weakens cohesion.</comment>
