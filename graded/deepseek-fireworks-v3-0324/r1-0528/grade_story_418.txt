<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is vividly clear and consistent, her headstrong nature and fear of her own power adding depth. Her actions align perfectly with her goal of restoring color, and her "voice" is distinct through her defiant yet hopeful perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the glitter method driving the action logically. The arc from uncertainty to awe feels complete, though the pacing slightly rushes the climactic transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive storms create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (luminous fruit, howling storms) are masterfully deployed to reinforce the contrast between desolation and defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyra's magical act is rich with symbolism (glitter as hope, feminization as empathy). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "confession" aspect could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh—glitter as transformative magic subverts expectations. The prose avoids cliché, and Lyra's emotional nuance ("merry bitterness") feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity serves the story's intensity, leaving the reader with a lingering sense of fragile hope.</comment>
