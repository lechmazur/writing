<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris is vividly realized, with his soft voice and embroidered vest adding depth. His motivation (preservation) is clear and compelling, though his backstory is hinted at rather than explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blackout and train deviation logically leading to the discovery of the Silent Plains. Pacing is excellent, balancing urgency and introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—the fog-shrouded valley, the cafe’s suspended isolation, and the oppressive silence of the plains create a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evokes profound emotional and sensory engagement. The "blissful agony" of the plains' scream is a standout metaphor, and the ending is resonant but leaves room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The concept of sound-absorbing plains and energy capture feels fresh, and the prose avoids AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the blackout and cafe serving the theme of hidden resonance. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
