<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's character is deeply nuanced, with clear motivation and a distinct arc. His past as a musician and current despair are well-integrated, though his transition to humor feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pen's mechanism driving a coherent, symbolic rewind. Pacing is strong, though the ending’s hopeful shift could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The postal facility’s cold automation contrasts brilliantly with Leo’s emotional turmoil. Sensory details (e.g., "ghostly strains," "clatter of parcels") immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pen as key to regret) and subtext. The ending’s "joyful despair" is haunting, though the theme’s delivery borders on overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cosmic clock mocking"). Minimal cliché, though the mentor trope is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant, lingering question about redemption.</comment>
