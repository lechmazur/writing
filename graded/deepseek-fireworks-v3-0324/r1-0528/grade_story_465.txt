<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Lyra's preparation to the spectral overload and resolution. The pacing balances urgency and reflection well within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The antique airship and twilight playground create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (cider, starlight, groaning hull) immerse the reader and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Storytelling is polished, with layered symbolism (ruler as rhythm, feast as shared memory) and a resonant theme of rekindling wonder. The ending is poignant and purposeful.</comment>
