<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivations are richly layered, and his reactions to the chopstick wrapper reveal deep personal history. His telekinetic abilities blend seamlessly with his profession, enhancing his distinct characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with flashbacks and the revival of the booth's spirit serving a clear arc. Pacing is deftly managed, though the word limit slightly constraints resolution depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival booth is vividly atmospheric, with decaying prizes and spectral details amplifying the theme of latent possibility. Sensory details (sound bites, grease-stained paper) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the wrapper as transformative relic) and subtext (knowledge as both burden and power). The ending resonates with thematic weight, though a touch more emotional punch would perfect it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding tropes. The prose is lush but purposeful, and Silas’s emotional journey feels authentically human. Minor over-reliance on "whispering" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the chopstick wrapper’s significance elevates the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of transformation and loss.</comment>
