<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's assertively meek nature is vividly portrayed and drives her actions; her bartender background adds depth but could be more seamlessly integrated into her escape motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the "xenialize" climax feels slightly abrupt. Pacing manages the word limit well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mirage oasis setting is brilliantly atmospheric, with sensory details (lemon polish, acrid smoke) enhancing the digital-prison contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry, card) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying yet leaves thematic weight. Stylistically polished.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original blend of tech and hospitality themes; avoids clich√©s. Some phrases ("radical, unwarranted hospitality") lean slightly pretentious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. Length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Minor quibble: "xenialize" risks gimmickiness.</comment>
