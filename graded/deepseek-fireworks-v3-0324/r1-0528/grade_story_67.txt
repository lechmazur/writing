<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hamish's character is well-developed, with his joviality contrasting sharply against the grave task, revealing depth. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Hamish's action, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-effect relationships are logical, and pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic setting and encroaching dusk create a potent atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, ozone, whispering void) are evocative and enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's literary devices (symbolism of the metronome, melancholy as a "presence") are strong. The ending is purposeful, though the theme could be more subtly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the machine's concept and Hamish's struggle. Emotional resonance is achieved through showing rather than telling, avoiding AI clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, with the story feeling deliberate rather than constrained. Leaves a lingering question about taming despair.</comment>
