<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris Thorne's motivation is clear and compelling, driving his investigative actions. His suspiciously trusting nature adds depth, though his "mischievous wisdom" could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The candle analysis method is inventive, though the mirror maze's role feels slightly underutilized in driving the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth of broken mirrors and abandoned lab create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., candle soot, scraping broom) enhance immersion, though the "leaf raking" timeframe could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candle as witness, mirrors as distortion) elevates the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the "mischievous wisdom" tone clashes lightly with the story's gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., wick as narrative). Minor AI-like phrasing ("hopeful rhythm") and a predictable whistleblower resolution slightly detract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the candle analysis as a standout creative choice. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about cryptid ethics.</comment>
