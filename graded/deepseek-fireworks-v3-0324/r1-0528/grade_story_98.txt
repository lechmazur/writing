<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fainthearted sentinel's reliance on the plastic ruler as a crutch and subsequent transformation is compelling. Motivation is clear, but his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The transition from mundane to mystical is seamless, though the dog-walking frame feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the chamber's pulsing shadows and tapestry are vividly immersive. Sensory details elevate the tension and mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (ruler vs. tapestry) and thematic depth. Ending resonates, though the Grand Archivist's dialogue borders on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion, but the "intimately distant" phrasing feels forced. Avoids AI pitfalls with originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. The brief length enhances the story's intensity, leaving a lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
