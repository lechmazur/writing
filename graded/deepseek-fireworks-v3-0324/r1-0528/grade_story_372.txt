<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Wraith's motivations and reactions are clear, but his "lovelorn" trait feels underexplored. Kael's indifference and shared history add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent pacing with logical cause-and-effect. The plot arc is complete, though the cleaners' adaptability slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive world-building with exceptional sensory details. The slums' decay and tech juxtaposition enhance tension and character stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and subtext, particularly in themes of betrayal and exhaustion. Symbolism (sticky label, reflections) is deftly handled.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though the "lovelorn" angle feels underutilized for full authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite constraints. Leaves a lingering sense of existential chase, though the "rambling destiny" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>
