<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with her secretive nature and protective drive shaping her actions. The 'angrily peaceful' attribute adds depth, though it could be more explicitly shown in her interactions.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a logical progression, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The tie between her playlist hacking and the ghost train's awakening is compelling but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing immersion. The ghost train's eerie presence is well-utilized, though its connection to the teapot could be deeper.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively employs literary devices (symbolism in the cracked teapot) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful but could linger more on the thematic implications of preservation.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The playlist hacking as a method of encoding medicinal knowledge is particularly inventive. Some phrases border on overly ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A cohesive and compelling narrative that balances its elements well. The length feels deliberate, though a touch more thematic exploration would elevate it further.</comment>
