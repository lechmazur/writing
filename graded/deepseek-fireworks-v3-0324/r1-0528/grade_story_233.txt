<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's naivety and desperation are well-conveyed, but her shift to profound understanding feels slightly abrupt given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but effective; the urgency of "between commercials" adds tension. The arc from doubt to revelation is coherent and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The vault's paradox (powerful yet distant warmth) and virtual flames create vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like "cold marble warmed by trembling hand" stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (statue as bridge, lullaby as resonance). The ending's theme of "singing the world into alignment" lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original blend of modern (commercial breaks) and mythic (summoning). Lullaby as method feels fresh, though "seeds of understanding" borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the brevity enhances urgency. The story feels complete yet leaves room for reflection on connection vs. command.</comment>
