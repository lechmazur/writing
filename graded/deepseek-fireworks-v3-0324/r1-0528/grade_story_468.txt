<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Finch's curiosity and mortician background are well-integrated, driving his actions and interactions with the spirits. His motivation is clear and aligns with his traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, propelled by Finch's imitation of the heron and the vanishing footprints. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "gnarled roots," "wordless harmonies") are evocative and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (bracelet, journals) and subtext (exchange as a test). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of curiosity vs. decorum resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of "polite anarchy" and the spirits' behavior is nuanced. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind.</comment>
