<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's baffled state and pickpocket background are well-explored, but his shift to poetic reflection feels slightly abrupt. The dummy's role in revealing his internal conflict is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but strained by the tight word limit. The poetry sessions drive the arc, though their abrupt introduction weakens pacing slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—haunted engine room and eerie dummy merge seamlessly. Sensory details (brine, rust, grinding machinery) heighten tension and immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dummy as catalyst) and subtext (transformation through art). Ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (moonlight on cobblestones). Avoids clichés, though the dummy's "scorching poise" occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite density. Length feels deliberate; the story lingers on Silas's internal shift, though the poetry method slightly disrupts flow.</comment>
