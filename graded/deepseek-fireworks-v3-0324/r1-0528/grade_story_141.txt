<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The scavenger hunt introduction feels slightly abrupt, but the transition to the cave exploration is seamless and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater cave system is vividly rendered, with exceptional sensory detail and atmosphere that amplifies the eerie, mystical tone. One of the story's strongest elements.</comment>
