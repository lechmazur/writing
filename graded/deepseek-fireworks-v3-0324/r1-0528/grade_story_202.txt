<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly portrayed as a meticulous poisoner, with his dual nature as a skateboarder adding unexpected depth. His motivation (authentication) and reaction to the rapier’s crack reveal subtle introspection, though his "innocently guilty" feeling could be more explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is tight and purposeful, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the skateboarding motif feels slightly underutilized as a plot driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum’s atmosphere is lushly rendered, with sensory details (dusty starlight, albatross) enhancing the mood. The rapier’s spotlight moment is particularly evocative, though the conservatory reveal could feel more climactic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft: the cracked hilt as symbolism, the moth’s iridescent map as subtext, and the ending’s thematic weight ("preserving something beautiful") resonate deeply. Literary devices are wielded with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh—no clichés. The poisoner-skateboarder dichotomy and the moth-as-map twist defy predictability. Language is stylish without excess, though "code of instinct" verges on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exemplary cohesion. Elements serve the story organically, and the brief length feels intentional. Leaves the reader with a haunting reflection on preservation vs. erasure.</comment>
