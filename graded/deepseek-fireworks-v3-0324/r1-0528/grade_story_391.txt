<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrian's motivation is vivid and consistent, driving the narrative forward with purpose. His roguish yet cautious nature shines, though more dialogue or inner monologue could deepen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The driftwood revelation resolves the arc elegantly, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and sensory-rich. The coral reef city and phosphorescent jellyfish amplify the story’s mood, though the piano motif could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrian’s sonic lattice as rebellion is a striking metaphor. The ending resonates, though a touch more subtext about the Mer-King’s rule would heighten impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "logbook of a drowning mind"). Avoids AI tropes, and the prose balances lyricism with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, thought-provoking finish.</comment>
