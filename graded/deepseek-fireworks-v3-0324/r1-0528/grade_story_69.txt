<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorn's uncertainty and druidic nature are well-integrated, and his motivation (debt obligation) is clear and consistent. His reaction to the tech environment reveals his discomfort, but his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the audition serving as a clear arc. Pacing is effective, and cause-and-effect (debt -> audition -> transformation) is logical. Minor abruptness in Thorn's shift from uncertainty to action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the hologram repair shop contrasts vividly with Thorn's nature, and sensory details (neon glow, vines, holographic moonlight) immerse the reader. Setting enhances both action and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact and thematic depth (nature vs. technology, obligation vs. creativity). Literary devices (symbolism of the lunch tin, hybrid growth) are deftly used. Ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of druidic magic and tech decay. Avoids clichés, and metaphors (e.g., "forging beauty from anarchy") feel fresh. Nuanced emotion, though Thorn's internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate despite tight word count. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering sense of ephemeral beauty, though the theme could be slightly sharper.</comment>
