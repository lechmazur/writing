<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear but his spectral grace feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his role as a conduit, but deeper character nuance would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the rain ritual, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but "specifically universal" feels slightly forced. The puppeteer metaphor avoids clich√© with fresh execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the tailgating contrast could be sharper. The length serves the mystical tone well.</comment>
