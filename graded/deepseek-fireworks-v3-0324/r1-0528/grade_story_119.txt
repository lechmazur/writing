<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena's motivations are clear and consistent, with her astral projecting skills and compassion driving her actions. However, the "sometimes always" phrasing feels forced and disrupts her otherwise solid characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method of fleeing via sun shadows is creative, though the abrupt shift to the tunnel entrance could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and immersive, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are used effectively, though the shadow-tracking method could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story excels in tension and atmosphere, with strong literary devices. The ending is purposeful, but the "unyielding compassion" theme occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases (e.g., "sometimes always") feel unnatural. The emotional resonance is strong, but the prose occasionally falters in clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The elements are cohesively integrated, and the brief length feels deliberate. The story leaves a lingering sense of tension, though a few elements (e.g., the key's wards) could be more sharply defined.</comment>
