<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "nimbleness" feels underutilized beyond the initial description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, urgent pacing with a clear arc. The storm’s arrival and the dance’s timing are well-synchronized, though the driftwood orchard's mechanics could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the "physically metaphysical" tension and sensory details (brine, glow, rain) immerse deeply. The setting is both surreal and emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (cultural reclamation, adaptation). The ending satisfies, though the "jaded wonder" tone slightly undercuts the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and originality, but the "storm of secrets" borders on cliché. The locksmith’s voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the driftwood orchard’s logic strains credulity. The story lingers, but some elements feel overly decorative.</comment>
