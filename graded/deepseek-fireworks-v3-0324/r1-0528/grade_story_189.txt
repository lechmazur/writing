<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative with a distinct, unwavering resolve. The "brazen calm" attribute is consistently demonstrated, though more depth in backstory could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The climax and resolution feel earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the spectral warning's impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully craftedâ€”oppressive gloom and celestial revelations blend seamlessly. Sensory details (salt, static, cold light) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the key, star maps as metaphor) and a haunting ending linger. Subtext about human ambition vs. cosmic threats enriches the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, blending post-war scarcity with cosmic horror. The phone booth key is a standout invention, though "brazen calm" borders on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the theme. Leaves the reader pondering humanity's place among "grand designs."</comment>
