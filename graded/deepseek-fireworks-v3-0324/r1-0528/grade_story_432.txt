<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's dual motivations—death wish vs. duty—are compelling and well-integrated. His paradoxical role as a poison taster deepens his characterization, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, cohesive plot with clear cause-and-effect. The binding action drives the narrative elegantly, though the radio-psychic method feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the subterranean setting and luminous fungi create vivid immersion. The serene/tumultuous contrast elevates the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bookmark as anchor, ice as chaos) and layered themes. Ending is resonant, though the psychic-call subplot slightly dilutes focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with few clichés. Some phrases verge on ornate ("diamond dust" cataclysm), but the voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified whole. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
