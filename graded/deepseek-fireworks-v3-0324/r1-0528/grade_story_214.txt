<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is deeply compelling; his motivation and emotional arc are clear, nuanced, and drive the narrative. His voice is distinct, and his use of the sea glass as both relic and talisman is masterful.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc despite brevity. The microfilm revelation and celestial event escalate tension organically, though the pacing near the end slightly rushes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with stellar sensory details (e.g., the "silently audible" wave). The setting amplifies themes of isolation and cosmic scale, though the observatory’s specifics could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: symbolism (sea glass, black hole), layered themes (loss/clarity/hope), and a resonant ending. Literary devices are wielded with precision, and the prose elevates the emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors (e.g., "siphon radiance"). The voice is distinctive, and the story subverts tropes with ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, powerful vignette. Elements serve the story seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional weight. Creative and deeply satisfying.</comment>
