<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her ambition and peculiar faith driving her actions. Finn's loyalty subtly enhances her resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blizzard and poster discovery logically advancing the quest. Pacing is effective despite brevity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically deep. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about cultural preservation.</comment>
