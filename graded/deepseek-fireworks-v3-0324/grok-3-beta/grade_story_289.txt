<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "brainy observer" trait shaping her actions and her connection to the doll revealing vulnerability. Her distinct voice and alignment with her mission stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's action of creating ephemeral art, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay and its ethereal light enhance the atmosphere and action beautifully. Sensory details immerse the reader, and the setting meaningfully connects to the doll and Elara's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the doll, murals) and evocative imagery. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of resilience emerges clearly. Some emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though a few phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style feels individual, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of connection to the lost civilizations.</comment>
