<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past, but the "reincarnated goldfish caretaker" aspect feels slightly forced. His voice and actions are consistent, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the storm's sudden intervention feels contrived. The resolution is satisfying but leans on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (toy soldier) connect meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the dialogue occasionally feels overly polished. The ending is purposeful but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though the goldfish reincarnation trope risks clich√©. The writing avoids purple prose and shows nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements (like the storm) feel imposed. The brevity works, leaving a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
