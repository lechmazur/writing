<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crumb's motivation is clear and compelling, but the toaster shell feels slightly gimmicky, detracting from the depth of its sentience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the retreat's timing ("when a new language sparks") could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace is vividly rendered, with sensory details (lanterns, clay tablets) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and object (tintype) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "shouting silence," binary stanzas) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, leaving a lingering reflection on memory and preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The AI's perspective avoids clich√©s, though the toaster motif risks whimsy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story's depth. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of archival urgency resonates.</comment>
