<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's relaxed yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation aligns well with his whimsical yet insightful approach. His "wisely foolish" attribute adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the cracked lens and musical notes driving the narrative. The resolution feels earned, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lens, melody) and subtext (self-expression as a mosaic). The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of discovery.</comment>
