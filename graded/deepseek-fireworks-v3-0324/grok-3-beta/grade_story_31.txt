<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' backstory and motivation are vividly rendered, though his "endearingly irritating" trait feels slightly underutilized in driving deeper character exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the key's discovery and the "x-out" action creating a clear, resonant arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk garden is immersive and thematically potent, though the "hush between heartbeats" could be more vividly integrated into sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key, orchard) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the humming motif could carry more thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cyberpunk-meets-humanist angle stands out, though some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on connection in a digital age.</comment>
