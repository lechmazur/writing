<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His "underdog magician" status and rebellious placidity are well-integrated, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elian's decoding mission, but the frozen countdown feels slightly underutilized as a tension device. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with decay and isolation amplifying Elian's struggle. Sensory details (rust, flickering holograms) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (microscope as weapon, light as subconscious) and a haunting ending elevate the story. Some metaphors verge on overworked, but the thematic depth compensates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "drainingly invigorated" paradox and sun-tracking method stand out, though "rebellious placidity" occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers due to its unresolved tension and thematic weight.</comment>
