<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jace's con artist persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His interaction with the ghostly child reveals unexpected depth, though his "unusually normal" attribute could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Jace's interrogation of ghosts, but the transition from hustler to reluctant comforter feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details that enhance the story's mood. The tape dispenser's connection to decay and guilt is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is potent, with strong symbolism (e.g., the dispenser as a "token of triumph"). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of remorse could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ghost interrogation premise, but some phrasing leans slightly generic ("gnawing pang"). The con artist's arc feels fresh, avoiding clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the tape dispenser and dystopian farm serving the narrative organically. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about redemption.</comment>
