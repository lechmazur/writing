<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's aloofness and cartographer background are well-integrated, but his motivation to learn the "language of the soul" feels slightly abstract. Lila's mirrored ache adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the kayaking method feels contrived. The cracked tile as a compass is poetic but underutilized in driving action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic mall is vividly rendered, though the kayak rental kiosk strains believability. Sensory details (neon, holograms) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (tile, kayak) and emotional resonance, but the ending’s "fleeting bond" resolution lacks punch. Subtext about memory is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but "eager resignation" and "language of the soul" verge on cliché. Kayaking as a bridge feels forced; the tile’s role is fresher.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite the mall/kayak dissonance. The theme of memory ties the story together, though the word limit strains some transitions.</comment>
