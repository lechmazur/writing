<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Torren's shaky resolve and carefully reckless demeanor are vividly portrayed, aligning well with his motivation to confront the past. The amber spider serves as a potent symbol of his stalled life, deepening his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Torren's search to his catharsis. The rumor chains and crypt ritual logically drive the narrative, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending sacred ruin and street art into a haunting backdrop. Sensory details (hissing spray cans, crunching glass) immerse the reader and amplify the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amber spider, murals) and subtext (guilt, redemption) elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional weight could be slightly more nuanced in its delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The amber spider and cathedral setting feel fresh, and Torren's internal conflict is handled with subtlety. Minor phrasing could be more distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length works, leaving a lingering sense of closure. Creative combination of themes and setting.</comment>
