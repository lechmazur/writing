<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her telepathy with her quest for knowledge. Her actions align well with her traits, though her "efficiently inefficient" method could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Mira's actions, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between her method and the blizzard payoff is strong, though pacing tightens near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grimy, frost-laden dock is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (oil, ice) are evocative, though the glacier's role could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the button hook, weather journals) enrich the narrative. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "noble foolishness" could be more subtly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The telepathic barista and ice-deciphering method stand out, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Mira's future.</comment>
