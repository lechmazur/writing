<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation is clear and compelling, blending logic and madness with a rebellious spirit. His actions align well with his obsession, though his 'dazed' nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Cedric's chalked messages, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax. The cosmic dance concept ties the beginning and end effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered with resonant sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere and Cedric's quest. The setting and object (chalk) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (chalk as a bridge) and subtext (madness vs. logic) enrich the story. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cosmic dance"). Cedric's nuanced obsession and the garden's eerie tone defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with its theme of harmony in chaos, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>
