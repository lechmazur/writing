<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "forthright peddler" trait feels underutilized. His meek assertiveness is well-conveyed, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's search, but the transition to the asteroid belt feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned medical bay is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "joyful loneliness" is hauntingly effective. Sensory details elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the bouquet, the oath) and emotional resonance, but the ending leans slightly toward predictability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its melancholy tone and cosmic scale, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Avoids clich√©s but could push further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its word count. Still, it lingers in the mind.</comment>
