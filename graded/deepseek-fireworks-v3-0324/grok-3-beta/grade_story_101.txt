<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lorian's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his "weathered heart," but his role as a "welcoming landlord" feels underutilized. His actions and manic clarity are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the parade detour, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The arc from despair to hope is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The studio's atmosphere is vividly rendered, and the pre-historic timeframe adds intrigue. Sensory details (e.g., the bee pin's gleam) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the bee pin, weathered hearts) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the manic tone occasionally overwhelms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The bee pin metaphor is fresh, but "weathered hearts" borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically dense, though the parade detour feels slightly contrived. Leaves a lingering question about legacy and connection.</comment>
