<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered as a repressed poet, with his terror of unvoiced truths and yearning for cosmic verse aligning well with his actions. His distinct voice and reaction to the perfume bottle reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ambush and spontaneous decision driving momentum. The arc from doubt to resolve feels complete, and pacing is deftly managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (moss, brambles, perfume) enhancing mood. The setting amplifies Elias's internal conflict and the story's themes of decay and beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (perfume bottle as relic, wild dogs as guardians) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the prose elevates the story's emotional and thematic impact.</comment>
