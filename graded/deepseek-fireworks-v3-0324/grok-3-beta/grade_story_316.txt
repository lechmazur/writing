<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eirini's timid yet resolute nature is well-developed and drives her actions; her motivation (childhood promise) is clear and consistent, though her "seraphic" quality feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the scoreboard method feels tangential; pacing is strong, though the resolution leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple and post-industrial setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (ivy, dusty arcade) enhancing atmosphere; the object (ribbon) ties meaningfully to the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (quilt, ribbon) and emotional resonance elevate the story, but some metaphors ("scattered harmony") verge on overwrought. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (healer archetype, nostalgic revival); prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for lyricism. Nuanced emotion saves it from feeling generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the scoreboard feels forced. Length suits the narrative, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
