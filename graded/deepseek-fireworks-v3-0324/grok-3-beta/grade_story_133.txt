<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's jaded locksmith background and his shift to pottery are well-integrated, but his "delightfully menacing" air feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the transition from pottery to hunting legacy feels abrupt; the word limit strains the arc's natural progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vividly rendered, though the colonial town's rooftops are underutilized. Sensory details (sunset, gloves) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (gloves as maps) and thematic depth, but the ending's resolution leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sky smeared with painting season"), though the throne concept borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tight length, but the pottery class feels incidental compared to the hunting legacy focus.</comment>
