<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sereth Vax's cyber-templar identity and "patiently frantic" energy are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to reflect lightning feels slightly abstract, though aligned with his defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prism and storm collision creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the "mirage of safety" could be more explicitly woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky burial setting is masterfully evoked, with electric skies and skeletal remains amplifying the tone. Sensory details (humming armor, wind) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bridle, prism) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s thematic resonance—safety as illusion—is potent, though the euphoric agitation could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of cyberpunk and mysticism avoids clichés. Some phrases ("bruised and electric sky") verge on ornate, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The prism’s role feels slightly contrived, but the story’s brevity enhances its intensity.</comment>
