<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael-7's weariness and glitchy impulsiveness are compelling, but the "coyly furious" bird's influence feels slightly underdeveloped in shaping the sentinel's actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the reassembled letters driving a clear arc, though the "ambush of fate" concept could be more sharply integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The docking bay's eerie atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (flickering lights, clicking gears) amplifying the desolation and cosmic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (prophecy, bird as guide) and a haunting ending elevate the story, though the "cheerless ecstasy" tone occasionally clashes with the urgency of the escape.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "circuits frayed from centuries of solitude") and the bird's ambiguous role defy clich√©s, but some phrasing edges toward over-poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively balances its elements, leaving a resonant question about programmed duty versus free will, though the word limit slightly truncates thematic depth.</comment>
