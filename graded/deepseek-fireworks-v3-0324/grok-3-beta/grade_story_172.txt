<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "unsettled" nature and "sharp gentleness" shaping her actions. Her use of the puzzle box and reversed wishes reveals depth, though her "accidentally heroic" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prophecy and puzzle box driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned, though the "deserted hallway" connection is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The seashell setting and architectural secrets create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (pearlescent walls, saltwater) enhance tension, and the setting actively influences the plot and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (puzzle box as mansion, reversed wishes) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the prose is evocative without being overwrought. Minor quibble: the "sharp gentleness" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The reversed-wishes method is inventive, and the prose avoids AI hallmarks like abrupt jumps or generic descriptors. Emotion is shown through action and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brief length feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
