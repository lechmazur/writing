<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's lovelorn nature and spy background are well-integrated, but his "curiously indifferent" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his emotional turmoil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the confrontation with Zane is impactful, though the urban exploration meetup feels contrived as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon-drenched slums are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the derelict factory scene could use more atmospheric depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original setting and fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on overworked ("avalanche of corporate enforcers"). Avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the urban exploration thread feels tacked on. The brevity works, though the resolution could be sharper.</comment>
