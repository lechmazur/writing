<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her telepathic abilities and the hair tie, but her "tragically joyful" attribute could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's search, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the mechanic's revelation. The calligraphy method is inventive but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the "gloomy cheerfulness" tone could be more consistently reflected in sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hair tie, calligraphy) and emotional resonance, but the ending's hopeful note feels slightly abrupt given the weight of Elara's quest.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "tragically joyful" nuance is fresh, though the telepathic statue concept risks leaning into tropes without deeper subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts (calligraphy, weatherize) could be more fully explored.</comment>
