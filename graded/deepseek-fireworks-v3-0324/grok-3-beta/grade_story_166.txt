<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's ghostly nature and solemnly silly demeanor are well-integrated, but her motivation to communicate with animals feels slightly underdeveloped given the stakes of mending fate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's actions, though the connection between the straw and forbidden logs could be tighter. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frost-tipped fur, ghostly laughter) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's haunting melody and spectral imagery are memorable, but the deeper theme of fate feels slightly overshadowed by the whimsical tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The plastic straw as a spectral tool is inventive, though the "gentle chaos" tone occasionally clashes with the gravity of fate-weaving.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the balance between whimsy and profundity could be sharper. Leaves a lingering question about the orchard's fate.</comment>
