<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's dual identity as a faux fortune teller with real visions is compelling, and her motivation to study sacred development is clear and consistent. Her "peaceful anger" adds depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Maris's exploration, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the crypt discovery. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The extinct language archive and planting season create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the flute's coldness, crumbling parchments) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (flute as a key to sacred development) and subtext about forgotten truths are strong. The ending resolves purposefully, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the bone flute and Maris's unique gift, but "peaceful anger" edges toward clich√©. The prose avoids purple tendencies but could refine its metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though tighter integration of "getting lost" would elevate cohesion.</comment>
