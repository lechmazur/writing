<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bruno's docile yet bruiser nature is compellingly juxtaposed, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the baton quest, though the shredded map feels underutilized. Pacing is strong, but the resolution leans on mystical convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered, with sensory details (drum solos, snapping plants) amplifying tension. Atmosphere and setting are flawlessly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal premise and Bruno's paradoxes, though "brash tenderness" occasionally veers into tonal inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, mythic vignette, but the brevity leaves some thematic potential unexplored.</comment>
