<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's quiet deserter persona is vividly portrayed, with his motivation to escape war and find belonging clearly driving his actions. His use of the cracked mirror and masks reveals depth, though his "noble foolishness" could be more consistently explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with carbonizing memories as a compelling central action. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the "jigsaw puzzles of time" framing feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plant communication study setting is immersive and richly detailed, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (humming plants, fractured mirror) deepen atmosphere, though the timeframe could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, masks) and subtext (belonging as shedding). The ending is poignant, and the theme of transformation is layered. Minor quibble: "noble foolishness" tone occasionally overrides nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (carbonized memories) and minimal clich√©s. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, though some phrases ("dizzyingly grounded") verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on belonging. A few elements (timeframe, tone) slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
