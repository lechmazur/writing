<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with a distinct voice and motivation, though his "warmly aloof" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the transition to vanishing feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper setup for cloud paths.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cargo hold’s atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details that amplify Elias’s isolation and regrets. The nebulae connection is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chalk, dial tone) and subtext, though the ending’s emotional punch could be sharper. Theme of time is poignant but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "time’s up, old friend"), though the cloud-path method leans slightly into trope territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the word limit slightly truncates the thematic depth. Leaves a lingering melancholy.</comment>
