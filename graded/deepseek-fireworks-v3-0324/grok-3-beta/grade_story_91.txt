<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His synthetic nature contrasts beautifully with his gentle demeanor, and his actions consistently align with his mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The method of "quiet tuning" drives the narrative logically, though the word limit slightly rushes the scientists' transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The weather station and ghost stories create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "sterile clatter," "phantom rains") deepen the mood and reinforce Elias's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (fedora, shadows) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of rediscovering awe resonates deeply. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of sci-fi and lyrical realism feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful, with nuanced emotion and vivid metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Creative and deeply thoughtful.</comment>
