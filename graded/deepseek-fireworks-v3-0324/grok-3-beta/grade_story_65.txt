<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon's slapdash nature and desperate motivation are vividly portrayed, driving his actions with reckless defiance. His voice is distinct, though his melancholy could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from defiance to fleeting reprieve. The tectonic tension mirrors Eamon's internal struggle, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jagged, trembling setting is masterfully evoked, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (rumbling earth, shimmering brass) immerse the reader, though the grove's sanctity could be more vividly contrasted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doorplate, hourglass) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant but could linger more. Subtext about defiance and mortality is strong, though some metaphors verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. Eamon's audacity feels fresh, though the "possibly impossible" concept edges toward vagueness. The tone balances melancholy and glee well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting tale. The brevity serves the story, leaving a resonant question about mortality. Only the picnic tradition feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
