<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's apathy and reluctant motivation are clear, but his shift toward care feels slightly abrupt. The "enthusiastically lazy" attribute is unique but inconsistently portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the river's guidance, though the frame-matching method could be more vividly explained. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dream studio and divine twilight are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (coffee grinder, shimmering threads) enhancing immersion. The setting elevates the concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dying god, coral reefs) and subtext about purpose resonate. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but "gentle sharpness" and "river wisdom" lean toward clich√©. Nuanced emotion shines in Kael's arc, but some phrasing feels algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the coffee grinder and frames could be more integral. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
