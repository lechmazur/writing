<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "angrily peaceful" nature could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated. His distinct voice and aloof passion are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's mission, though the betrayal reveal feels slightly rushed. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit, but the funhouse confrontation lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (rust, peeling paint, storm) are immersive and support Elias's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teapot cracks, ghost train) and subtext (preservation vs. betrayal). The ending is purposeful, though the hug's emotional impact could be deepened.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (playlist hacks as encryption). Avoids clich√©s, but the "angrily peaceful" dichotomy occasionally feels overstated. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the story lingers. The brief length feels deliberate, though the marathon training could be more integrated.</comment>
