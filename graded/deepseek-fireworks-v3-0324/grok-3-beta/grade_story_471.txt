<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jericho's reckless yet introspective nature is well-developed, and his motivation to map ghost towns is clear. His shift toward vulnerability and connection feels earned, though his "meticulously careless" trait could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution with the musicians feels slightly rushed. The forgotten promise resurfaces effectively, though the pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The misty forest and abandoned funfair are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances Jericho's emotional journey, though the carousel's symbolism could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (e.g., the lens as a mirror). The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused ("skeletal carousel").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s for the most part, but Jericho's epiphany leans slightly toward predictability. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creatively combines elements. The length suits the narrative, leaving a lingering sense of redemption, though the musicians' inclusion could feel more organic.</comment>
