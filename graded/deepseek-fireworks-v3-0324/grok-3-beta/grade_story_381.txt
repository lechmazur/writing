<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with her grandfather's influence and her mission to preserve humanity's secrets adding depth. Her unconventional method of forging alliances through old movies reveals her creativity and emotional intelligence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Veyra's determination to her near-completion of the map. The connection between her rituals and the spirits' guidance is logical, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered, with its refracted light and holographic projections enhancing the futuristic nostalgia. Sensory details like Bogart's crackling voice and the hum of resolve immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the baseball cap, the cave as a mausoleum) and subtext (memory vs. oblivion). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deepened with more nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and offers a fresh blend of necromancy and retro-futurism. The writing style is purposeful, though a few phrases ("nostalgic ruin," "celluloid dreams") edge toward overused lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the baseball cap and old movies serving the theme of preservation. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about humanity's legacy.</comment>
