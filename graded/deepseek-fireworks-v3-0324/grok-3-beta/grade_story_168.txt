<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's ruthless precision and intellectual spontaneity are vividly portrayed, aligning well with her motivation to decode the rock art. The comb as a talisman adds depth, though her "flower arranger" trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marla's quest, but the road trip backstory feels rushed. The stone circle's mystery is compelling, though the resolution leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The eerie atmosphere of Dartmoor and the stone circle is masterfully evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The comb's connection to the setting is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (comb, carvings) and layered themes of rebellion elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the "polite anarchy" tone occasionally clashes with the prose's elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "flower arranger" motif feels contrived. The comb's symbolism and Marla's spontaneity feel fresh, though the dialogue lacks naturalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the comb and stone circle standing out. The brevity works, though the road trip detour slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
