<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris's claustrophobia and her role as an underwater explorer create a compelling tension. Her motivation to study human behaviors is clear, though her shift from fear to healing could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the jam-tasting method feels slightly abrupt as a resolution. Pacing is strong, though the word limit constraints show in the rapid emotional shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house is vividly rendered, and sensory details (jams, steam, moss) enhance the atmosphere. The setting perfectly mirrors Maris's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (glasses, jams) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of healing could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "eyes like tide pools"). Avoids clich√©s, though the jam ritual edges toward whimsy. Emotional resonance is strong but not overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of healing, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
