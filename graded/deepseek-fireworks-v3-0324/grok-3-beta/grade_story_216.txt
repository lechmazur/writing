<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dorian's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his role as a scapegoat, but his transition to reclaiming his identity could be more nuanced. His "robustly delicate" nature is well-explored, though his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the cryptic calls, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the final reveal could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cloud City is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances Dorian's quest. The setting and object (washer) are meaningfully connected, though the "last library card" detail feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are strong, but the emotional resonance is occasionally undermined by telling rather than showing. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of identity could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the writing style is purposeful. Some metaphors verge on overused, but the overall voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. Minor pacing issues hold it back from perfection.</comment>
