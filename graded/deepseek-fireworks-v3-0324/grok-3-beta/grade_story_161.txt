<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His sardonic voice and obsession with the seal reveal a complex, wounded character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from suspicion to revelation. The peacock's tail as a cipher is inventive but slightly strained in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile yet tense atmosphere of the facility mirrors Elias's psyche perfectly. Sensory details (orchard soil, iridescent feathers) enrich the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (peacock, seal) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the metaphor of paper planes feels slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The peacock cipher is unexpected, and Elias's voice feels distinct. Minor over-reliance on "sardonic glee."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about justice and obsession. Creative combination of disparate elements.</comment>
