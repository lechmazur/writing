<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his past, but his "creatively blocked" attribute could be more vividly shown through his actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coral reef memory serving as a natural catalyst. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution with Varn feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is richly detailed and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (brass-lit haze, hiss of steam) are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolism (gauntlet, coral reef). The ending is satisfying but could linger more on the moment of recognition between Elias and Varn.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "coded desperation" tone occasionally slips into melodrama. The coral reef metaphor is fresh and effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story naturally. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the word limit slightly truncates emotional depth.</comment>
