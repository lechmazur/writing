<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elyse's motivation is clear and compelling, blending her death wish with a deeper purpose. Her actions align well with her traits, though her "poison taster" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent, though the "final second" timeframe risks feeling gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and ice sculpture create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (mist, cracking ice) enhance the mood and tie into Elyse's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bookmark, energy flows) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, leaving room for reflection. Subtext about legacy and purpose is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "talk-radio psychics" method is inventive, though slightly jarring. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels intentional, and the combination of elements is creative and impactful.</comment>
