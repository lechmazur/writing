<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's apprehension and faltering aim are well-integrated, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. Lyra's impact is strong but could use more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the hot air balloon festival feels abrupt. Resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cyberpunk data center and ancient timeline blend evocatively. Sensory details (candle wax, neon hum) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle, dawn) is effective, but some metaphors verge on clich√©. Ending resonates emotionally but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original setting and theme, but "cycles of compassion" is heavy-handed. Prose avoids purple tendencies but occasionally over-explains.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints. Story feels deliberate, though the festival detracts slightly from momentum.</comment>
