<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elric's insomnia and artistic struggle are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "voice" is distinct, though deeper introspection could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elric's ritual, but the transition from scrying to painting feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop and bioluminescent mushrooms create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., paint-splattered bark, fungal grandeur) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wizard’s hat, bullet hole) and layered themes of grief elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the "frolicsome regret" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "devouring pain through art"). Avoids clichés, though the "painted smiles" concept borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the workshop and hat feeling integral. The brevity serves the story’s meditative quality, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
