<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn's dual nature as a careful poisoner and risk-taker is compelling, though her poisoner aspect feels underutilized. Her motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is tight and purposeful, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric sensory details. The skateboarding contrast is a standout touch, enhancing tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier as gravity's edge) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "serpent’s broken jaw"). Avoids clichés, though the poisoner element feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about Evelyn's duality.</comment>
