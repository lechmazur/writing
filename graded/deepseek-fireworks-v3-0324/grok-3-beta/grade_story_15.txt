<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending grief with defiance. Her "solemnly absurd" determination and use of postcards reveal depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her nurturing action, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the arc. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (singed veil, glowing embers) immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies her defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (forge as defiance, postcards as seeds) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of divine defiance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés. The "serious playfulness" tone is fresh, and metaphors (embers as stars) are vivid. Nuanced handling of hope and madness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative despite constraints. Elements serve the story, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about defiance’s limits.</comment>
