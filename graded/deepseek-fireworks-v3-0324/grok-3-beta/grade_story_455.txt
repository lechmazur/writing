<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his role as a wishing-well attendant, but his "intensely relaxed" demeanor feels slightly inconsistent with his inner turmoil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with shadow patterns and coins driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned, though the escape route's spy connection is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (moonlight, jingling coins) enhancing the haunted forest. The "inherited mystery" tone is sustained masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (coins as scars, shadows as guides) elevates the story. The ending is poignant, though the ghosts' role could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Some phrases ("weight of scars") verge on overused, but the execution is nuanced and stylistically distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
