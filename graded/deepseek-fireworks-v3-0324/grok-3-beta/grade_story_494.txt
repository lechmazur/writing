<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tapestry and song logically driving resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the curse's origin could be hinted at earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard and twilight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "blade wrapped in silk") elevate the mood, though more tactile elements would deepen immersion.</comment>
