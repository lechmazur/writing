<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Verdant's apathetic devotion is compelling and consistent, though its sentience as a houseplant risks gimmickry without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by curiosity, but the transition from drive-in to neighborhood feels abrupt under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with decay and neglect mirroring Verdant's internal conflict. Sensory details elevate immersion.</comment>
