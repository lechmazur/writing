<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "dutiful sentinel" role feels slightly underdeveloped in action. The hair clip symbolism is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the shift to the restaurant feels abrupt. The hair clip's destruction as a climax works well, but pacing wobbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab and wedding contrast is vivid, but the restaurant setting lacks the same atmospheric depth. Sensory details with algae/light are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and theme are potent, but dialogue is minimal. Ending is satisfying, though the "shared table" method feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "verdant algae pulsed"). Avoids clich√©s, though "primal sophistication" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the restaurant detracts slightly. Length feels deliberate; the story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
