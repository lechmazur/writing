<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eresh's sentimental and spontaneous traits are well-integrated, driving his actions and motivations. The hairpin serves as a poignant symbol, though his "chaotic humility" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the transition from boast to rebellion feels slightly abrupt. The coordinates as a method work, though their discovery lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Sumerian setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The palace and ship’s departure are effectively tied to Eresh’s emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hairpin, ship) and subtext (justice vs. chaos). The ending is purposeful, though the guard’s wavering could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but some phrases ("chaotic humility") feel slightly forced. Emotional resonance is achieved through showing, not telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the rebellion’s stakes could be clearer.</comment>
