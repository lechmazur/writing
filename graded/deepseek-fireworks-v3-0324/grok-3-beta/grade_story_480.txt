<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intriguing, blending digital and physical worlds. Her actions align well with her role as a social media exorcist, though her "indifferent enthusiasm" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Mara's hunt, but the transition from music hall to mess hall feels slightly abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (dust, moonlight) enhancing the eerie mood. The abandoned settings mirror the story's themes perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "her heart a quiet drum") are effective, and the subtext about digital alienation is strong. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept is highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is fresh, though a few phrases ("brittle, real sound") edge toward predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering question about connection, suggesting depth.</comment>
