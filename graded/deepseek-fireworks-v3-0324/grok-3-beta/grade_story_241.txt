<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "soft-voiced" trait feels underutilized in driving action. The vest's connection to her mission is strong, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The blackout's purpose is vague, and the train detour feels tangential. Pacing is deliberate but risks stagnation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World-building is exquisiteâ€”sensory details and the cafe's ethereal setting elevate the narrative. The vest's glow during the blackout is a standout moment of synergy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and potent symbolism (vest, plains) create depth, but the climax lacks visceral impact. Theme of silence vs. truth is intriguing but slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though "blissful agony" verges on overwrought. The vest's mythos and Elara's zeal feel fresh, but some phrasing borders on purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the train detour and "quiet partnerships" feel underbaked. The ending lingers, though the blackout's resolution is ambiguous.</comment>
