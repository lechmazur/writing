<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his "rarely authentic" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marcus's actions, though the handshake deal's immediacy feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is richly evoked, with decay and celestial carvings enhancing Marcus's fractured mindset. Sensory details are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, the theme of "escaping chains" could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The prepper trope is handled freshly, though the saffron-robed figure feels slightly clich√©d.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity slightly limits thematic depth. The ink blotter and constellations are standout integrations.</comment>
