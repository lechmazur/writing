<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "phantasmal humor" feels underdeveloped, lacking specific instances that reveal his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric buildup; the resolution ("solar winds shift") feels abrupt for such a grand mission.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details and cosmic imagery immerse the reader, though the "solar wind collection point" could be more vividly grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the central conflict (restoration vs. entropy) lacks tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though the "phantasmal humor" tone occasionally clashes with the story's solemn themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the brevity slightly undermines the scale of Lirien's cosmic mission.</comment>
