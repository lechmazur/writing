<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nexus-7 and Kael are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. The hive-mind therapist's bitter cheer and Kael's torment are compelling, though Kael's backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from torment to redemption. The wax-dripping method is inventive, but the facility's "bold discovery" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric, with evocative sensory details. The "uniformly peculiar" room and the scuffed charger plug enhance the mood, though the facility's broader context is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wax shapes, charger plug) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, but the emotional impact could be sharper. The theme of anchoring guilt is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The hive-mind therapist is a standout, though the "sound of hindsight" leans slightly toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the nature of healing and regret.</comment>
