<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elijah's unhinged zealotry is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His playful mania and earnest absurdity create a distinct voice, though his depth could be slightly richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elijah's confession, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor in the jungle is brilliantly evocative, with sensory details enhancing the absurd yet oppressive atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Elijah's fractured psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bottle cap, decay) and subtext (vulnerability as strength). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The writing is fresh, with nuanced emotion and style, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about faith and fragility.</comment>
