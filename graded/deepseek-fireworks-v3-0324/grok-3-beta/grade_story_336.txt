<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bahram's weariness and desperation are palpable, driving his actions with a clear, consistent motivation. His defiance against decay is compelling, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from despair to fleeting defiance. The astronomical clock's role is logical, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The palace's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending decay and grandeur. Sensory details (e.g., the car backfire) amplify tension, though the "tribal knowledge" connection could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clock as time's prison) and subtext (grief vs. hope). The ending is poignant, though the theme of futility could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of myth and melancholy, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("weight of endless farewells"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the clock and palace serving the story's mood. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache.</comment>
