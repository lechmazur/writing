<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "lost heiress" backstory feels underdeveloped. Her "bitterly optimistic" attribute shines, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The detour-to-overlook transition feels abrupt, though the unification arc is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and vivid, with strong sensory details. The station and cloud migrations elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and emotional resonance, but the ending lacks punch. Literary devices are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but leans into some tropes (e.g., "fractured reality"). Language is occasionally ornate without payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the word limit strains some elements. Leaves a lingering thematic question.</comment>
