<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirien's frazzled yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, with his motivation to document social changes aligning well with his actions. His "strongly weak" attribute adds depth, though his levitation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lirien's quest, but the levitation climax feels rushed. The connection between urban legends and the ink pot is clever, though pacing wobbles in the final third.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient Celtic and neon-futuristic elements is immersive and original. Sensory details (holographic mists, digital bark) enhance the atmosphere, though the grove's description could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink pot as courage) and subtext (tradition vs. innovation). The ending is satisfying, but the levitation sequence slightly undermines the grounded emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "pulsed with neon runes"). Minimal clich√©s, though "jubilant despair" toes the line of over-poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the ink pot and urban legends serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about cultural evolution.</comment>
