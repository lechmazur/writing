<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's cosmic powers and factory worker background create a compelling contrast, but her "academically wild" attribute could be more deeply integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual serving as a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the factory backdrop feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargoyle-terrace setting is vividly atmospheric, and the abyss amplifies the ritual's stakes. Sensory details (starlight, stone eyes) are deftly used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (brooch, abyss) and layered themes of rebellion elevate the story. The ending resonates with purposeful defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cosmic energy flared"). Minimal clich√©, though "ordered disarray" slightly strains the tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, memorable whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about Mara's next steps.</comment>
