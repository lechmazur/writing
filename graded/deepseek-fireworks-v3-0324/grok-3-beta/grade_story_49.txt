<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his "lukewarm" magic and emotional resonance, though his "loyally peculiar" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the fog-machine method feels slightly contrived. The clash of truths is effective, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar base setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, but the "hush before journal-opening" timeframe isn't fully exploited. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (doormat, fog) is potent, and the theme of fear and unity is compelling. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (exiled colonists, magic tied to emotion). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, though the fog method slightly strains believability. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, suggesting depth.</comment>
