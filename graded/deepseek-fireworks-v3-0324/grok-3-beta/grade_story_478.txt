<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's critical nature and midwife role are well-integrated, but her "openly secretive" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. Her motivation to recover memories is clear, though her actions could delve deeper into her profession's parallels.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the diaries and ritual logically driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the maelstrom's role could be more causally linked to her past.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard-maelstrom contrast is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (herbs, scorched pages) deepening the dissonant calm. The setting actively shapes Mara's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herbs, moon) and layered subtext (birth/recovery) elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, though the maelstrom's sentience could be more subtly hinted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("dissonant calm") verge on overuse. The ritual concept feels fresh, though Mara's profession could be more uniquely leveraged.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with the waxing moon and herbs serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting resonance.</comment>
