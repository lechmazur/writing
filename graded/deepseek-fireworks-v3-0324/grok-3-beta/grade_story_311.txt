<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his tension and stubbornness driving his actions. The faded photograph adds depth, though his "serene anger" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The rebellion theme is compelling, but the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the "humid air" and "artificial moonlight" are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, crater’s edge) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but some phrases ("serene anger") feel slightly overworked. The lunar rebellion concept is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about Marcus's future.</comment>
