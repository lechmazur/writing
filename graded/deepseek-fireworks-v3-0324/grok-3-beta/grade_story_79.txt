<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amos's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to his father's disappearance and the town's mysteries. His "ghostly resolve" and rebellion against silence are compelling, though his sheriff role could be more distinctively utilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Amos's quest, but the tight word limit leaves some connective tissue between the library and quarry abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending science and poetry to amplify the story's ethereal tone. Sensory details (e.g., the chain's tarnish, creaking wood) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (chain as tether, stars as clues) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional payoff could be sharper. Theme of grief vs. hope resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The chain's symbolism and Amos's nuanced rebellion feel fresh. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("ethereally physical").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the library and chain serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, though the quarry reveal could be more fleshed out. Leaves a haunting impression.</comment>
