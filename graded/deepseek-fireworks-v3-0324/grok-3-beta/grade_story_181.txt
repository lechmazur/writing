<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Malik's motivation is clear but his transition from spice trader to seeker of lost technologies feels slightly abrupt. His "blatantly secretive" attribute is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the climax (the near-kiss and doodle exchange) feels rushed. The connection between the beginning and end is present but could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (the dried flower, the birds' silence) are effective and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the flower, the sanctuary as a mirror for Malik's soul) are well-used, but the emotional impact is muted by the rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases ("edgy nostalgia") feel slightly forced. The handling of emotion is nuanced but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but the brevity limits its depth. The elements serve the narrative, but the ending feels more like a setup than a resolution.</comment>
