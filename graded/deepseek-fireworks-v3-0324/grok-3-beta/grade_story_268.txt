<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past as a soldier and his quest for redemption through divination well-integrated. His "artfully clumsy" attribute adds depth, though it could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's mission, with a clear arc. The virtual calls and mirror method work, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, creaks) enhance immersion, though the mirror's role could be more grounded in the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext (war's ghosts). The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (mirror as portal). Avoids clich√©s, though the "price of war" theme leans slightly generic. Nuanced handling of grief and redemption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Combines elements creatively, leaving a lingering impact. The mirror's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
