<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("doleful cheer") verge on contrived. The binder clip's mundanity is a standout twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the lace pattern's decoding feels rushed. The brevity serves the story well.</comment>
