<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gavrin's skepticism and minstrel background are well-integrated, driving his actions and voice. His motivation to out-scheme Veyl is clear and consistent, though his reckless generosity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the slingshot mechanism and disappearing ink twist creating a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the steam vent's role feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The factory's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hissing steam, grimy windows) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the story's themes of deception and transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (vanishing ink as metaphor) and a memorable twist. The ending is purposeful, though the irreverent tone occasionally undercuts emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The dragon-scale gambit and factory setting are inventive, though the "irreverent awe" tone sometimes feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about mortal vs. immortal cunning.</comment>
