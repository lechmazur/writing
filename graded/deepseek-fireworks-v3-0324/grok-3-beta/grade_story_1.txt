<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's phobias and motivation are vividly portrayed, driving his actions consistently. His "voice" is distinct, though his backstory via garage sales feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the garage sales timeframe feels tacked on. The net's resolution is satisfying, though the lead-in could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pyramid library and "mundanely spiritual" atmosphere are immersive and evocative, enhancing tension. Sensory details (dust, salt, whispers) are expertly deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (net as fear) and subtext, but some metaphors verge on clich√©. The ending resonates, though the "rebirth" theme is somewhat overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but "dance on the edge of madness" leans trope-y. Nuanced emotion shines in Marcus's trembling resolve, though some prose is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the garage sales motif feels forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of catharsis.</comment>
