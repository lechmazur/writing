<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is poetic and clear, but her transition from assassin to seeker of dawn feels slightly abrupt. Her "voice" is distinct, though her internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution (choosing to speak instead of strike) could be more earned. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the web, the lens's streaks) enhance the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, but the ending's emotional impact is slightly diluted by the rapid shift in Veyra's decision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The story avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion, but a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the theme of redemption could be sharper.</comment>
