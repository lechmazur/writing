<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elmer's socially awkward inventor persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His hopeful cynicism and attachment to the wooden whistle reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by "reversed trails," but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diner's encrypted archive and late-shift atmosphere are richly evoked, enhancing the theme of forgotten arts. Sensory details (whistle's grain, jukebox hum) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle, tree of regret) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance could be deeper. Style supports the story's melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "tree of regret") and nuanced emotion. No AI-generated tropes or jarring shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about redemption. Length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
