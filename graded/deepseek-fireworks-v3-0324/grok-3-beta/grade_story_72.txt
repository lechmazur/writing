<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael Vorn's sneering demeanor and furiously tranquil resolve are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "cup starlight" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the folded note and sifting action driving the narrative logically toward the starlight revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The domed vineyard and barren alien plain create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crimson vines, brittle leaves) elevate the setting's eerie beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (starlight as divine power) and evocative prose stand out, though the ending's awe leans slightly toward telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The "furiously tranquil" paradox and alien setting feel fresh, though "rambling destiny" borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette with thematic depth. The word limit feels deliberate, though the starlight's cosmic implications could be further explored.</comment>
