<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is compelling and consistent, but her "typically unique" trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her quest, though her voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her forbidden knowledge, but the clandestine meeting feels slightly contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain peak and crystal shadows create a vivid, eerie atmosphere, though the farmers market feels underutilized. Sensory details are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks full resolution. The theme of defying prophecy is clear but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "typically unique" is awkward. The baseball and prophecy twist feel fresh, but some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story cohesively, but the hidden location and market clash tonally. Leaves a lingering question about her twin.</comment>
