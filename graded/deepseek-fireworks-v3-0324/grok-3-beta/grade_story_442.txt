<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jace's edgy, pessimistic nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to preserve memory through vectorization is clear and compelling. His actions align well with his traits, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Jace's action, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The windmill's symbolism ties the beginning and end effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom house and bioluminescent spores create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are rich, and the setting enhances the theme of memory distortion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (candle, void) and symbolism. The ending is purposeful, though the subtext could be sharper. The writing style elevates the story's emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the narrative avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the windmill's role could be tighter.</comment>
