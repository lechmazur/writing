<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with his playful yet solemn demeanor adding depth. His use of the plush as a symbol of lost innocence is poignant, though his internal conflict could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kael's method of "reversed echoes," but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The word limit constraints are managed well, though the pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coral reef setting is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent details enhancing the atmosphere. The connection between the plush and the setting is subtle but effective, though more sensory immersion could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (the plush, reversed echoes) is strong, and the theme of moral ambiguity is compelling. However, the ending, while thought-provoking, lacks the emotional punch to fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Kael's voice is distinct, though some phrasing leans slightly toward the ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. The brevity feels deliberate, though a deeper exploration of Kael's internal struggle would strengthen its impact.</comment>
