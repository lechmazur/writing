<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's guarded yet passionate nature is well-developed, and his motivation to revive lost crafts is clear and compelling. His transformation feels earned, though his "skeptically credulous" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kael's discovery, but the decryption of vows feels slightly rushed. The arc from defiance to vulnerability is effective, though the word limit constraints show in pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest is vividly rendered, with synthetic and organic details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting mirrors Kael's rebellion beautifully, though the "engineered light" could be more evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, vows) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors ("angry peace") verge on overused. The theme of resistance is layered but occasionally heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The nano-forest concept is inventive, though the "grassroots movements" angle feels underexplored. Nuanced emotion, but a few phrases lean toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about cultural erasure. A few tighter edits could elevate it further.</comment>
