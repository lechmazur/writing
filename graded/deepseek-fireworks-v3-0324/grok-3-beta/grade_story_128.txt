<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Khepri's fretful yet hesitantly bold nature is well-developed and drives his actions. His motivation to see the world unfiltered is clear and consistent, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Khepri's daring action, though the jumbled TV subtitles method feels slightly forced. Pacing is effective, but the resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient Egyptian palace is vividly rendered with rich sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the story's tension and Khepri's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (fading photograph, ritual) is strong, and the theme of storytelling's power is compelling. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (ancient rituals, lost mentor). The TV subtitles are inventive but risk feeling gimmicky. Prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the anachronistic TV subtitles disrupt cohesion. The story feels deliberate in its brevity and leaves a resonant impression.</comment>
