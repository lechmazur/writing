<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, blending rebellion with preservation. His "spontaneously cautious" nature is well-integrated, though his roguish charm could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kael's decoding, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescence, salt-stained apron). Atmosphere and tone amplify the quiet revolution motif masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (piano, carvings) and subtext (oppression vs. unity). Ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The reef’s neural echoes and coded songs are inventive. Minor overuse of "ethereal" descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the piano motif feels slightly underutilized. Leaves a lingering sense of impending uprising.</comment>
