<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's boastfulness and transformation are clear, but his motivation to escape feels somewhat generic. His shift from boasting to silence is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The wire cutter as a tool for escape is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasp nest setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The organic glow and popping sounds create a distinct, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (rewiring reality) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The wasp nest as a prison is fresh, though some phrases ("precise madness") feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering thought about freedom and self-reinvention.</comment>
