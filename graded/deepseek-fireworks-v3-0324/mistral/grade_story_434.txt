<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his "commonly individual" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align with guarding the artifact, but his personality lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the zero-gravity flame method feels contrived. Pacing is tight, though the resolution is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival and booth are vividly rendered, but the "playful dread" tone wavers. Sensory details (e.g., flickering flame) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mood but lacks deeper subtext. Literary devices (e.g., the napkin as symbolism) are present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (mysterious artifact, lone guardian). The flame-in-zero-gravity idea is fresh but execution feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story leans on whimsy over depth. The length suits the premise, though the ending lacks lingering impact.</comment>
