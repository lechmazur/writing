<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edgar's gloomy yet abrasively charming demeanor is well-developed and consistent, with his motivation to reclaim lost light clearly driving his actions. His distinct voice and reactions to the drone reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well within the word limit, with the drone's message serving as a catalyst for Edgar's resolution. However, the transition from listening to decisive action feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rusted Ferris wheel, mechanical hum) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Edgar's melancholy and the theme of decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (wallet as memory vessel) and subtext (mechanical vulture as time/loss). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of melancholy and speculative elements (the drone), but some phrases verge on clich√© ("ghosts of laughter"). Nuanced handling of Edgar's grief elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity, with elements serving the story's theme of reclaiming lost joy. Leaves a lingering question about the drone's origin.</comment>
