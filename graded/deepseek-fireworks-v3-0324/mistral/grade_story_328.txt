<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's assertively meek nature is well-portrayed, but his motivation to escape the labyrinth feels slightly underdeveloped. His desperation and optimism are clear, but his transformation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Eli's dream to his realization. The connection between the labyrinth and technology is intriguing, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. The contrast between rustic and technological elements is effective, though sensory details could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (tapestry, greeting card) effectively and evokes thought, but the emotional impact could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel slightly formulaic. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the brevity limits depth. It leaves a thought but not a lasting impression.</comment>
