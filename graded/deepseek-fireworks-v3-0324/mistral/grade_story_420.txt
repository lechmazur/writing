<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. His epiphany feels organic but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the puzzle ring and dinosaur bones could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances Eli's introspection. Sensory details are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ring, bones) is strong, but the theme of transformation could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by familiar tropes (artist's epiphany). Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story leans on convention. The brevity works, though deeper exploration is missed.</comment>
