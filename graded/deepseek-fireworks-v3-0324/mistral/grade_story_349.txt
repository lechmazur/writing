<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's cynically hopeful nature is clear and drives his actions, but his backstory as a drone pilot feels underutilized in shaping his medieval interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the speed dating event cleverly bridging Eli's isolation and integration. However, the orchard's fate feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory and "charred serenity" tone are vividly rendered, but the orchard's impending destruction lacks emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herb bundle, stars) and emotional resonance, though the theme of "horizons of mercy" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on familiar tropes (stranger in a strange land). The speed dating event feels contrived for the setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though some elements (orchard, drone pilot) feel underdeveloped. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
