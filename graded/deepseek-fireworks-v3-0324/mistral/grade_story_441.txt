<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eamon's philosophical and physicist duality is compelling, but his barefoot trait feels underutilized. His motivation to compose a lullaby is unique but slightly overshadowed by the flash mob.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the flash mob's sudden appearance feels abrupt. The resolution is satisfying, though the accelerator's role could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sterile, humming accelerator contrasts beautifully with the chaotic flash mob. Sensory details (cold floor, crackling air) enhance the eerie atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stamps as unity) and a haunting lullaby motif. The ending resonates, though the flash mob's origin lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original blend of physics and existentialism. The stamps and lullaby concept feel fresh, though the flash mob leans slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the flash mob disrupts momentum. The lullabyâ€™s emergence lingers, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
