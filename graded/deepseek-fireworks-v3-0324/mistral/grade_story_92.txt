<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "carefully careless" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. His connection to the botanical collection is a strong moment of character revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The blood drive dare feels slightly contrived, but the resolution with the ghost is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with strong sensory details. The mansion's faded grandeur and the "loud silence" enhance the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (e.g., the wilting plants). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "silent agreements" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases ("loud silence") feel slightly overworked. The emotional nuance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering impression, though the blood drive element weakens cohesion slightly.</comment>
