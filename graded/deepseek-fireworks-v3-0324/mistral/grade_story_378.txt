<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eldridge's grumpy yet desperate motivation is clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "reluctant awe" is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans on prophecy tropes. The beetle's role is inventive, but the carnival's inclusion feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Swamp atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The polluted-to-verdant shift is the story's standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (beetle, wave-and-wall motif) and emotional resonance, though the ending borders on didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on some mystical tropes. The beetle's mechanics and Eldridge's voice feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the carnival and cafe feel tacked on. The length suits the arc.</comment>
