<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edmund's character is well-developed, with his "hyperactively serene" demeanor and motivation to bury old hatred clearly driving his actions. His use of the sticker sheet reveals his methodical nature and emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the sticker sheet and mixtape symbols logically leading to the letter. The resolution feels complete, though the steampunk setting slightly distracts from the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly described but feels somewhat disconnected from the emotional weight of the story. Sensory details (parchment, oil) are effective but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and subtext, with strong symbolism (stickers, mixtapes) and a poignant ending. The theme of hollow victory is subtly but powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with nuanced handling of emotion and fresh metaphors (e.g., "savage grace"). The writing style is purposeful and distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
