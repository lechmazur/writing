<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's "shyly loud" attribute is well-integrated, and his motivation to unravel sorrow is clear. The dinosaur plush adds depth, though his bardic role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by dream-hopping, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the machine's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and dreamscape are vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., flickering lights, grinding gears) are effective and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry, plush) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overused ("roots of an ancient tree").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dream-hopping concept, though "fragility of time" feels generic. Nuanced emotion avoids AI pitfalls, but the bard trope is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the timeframe's relevance could be sharper.</comment>
