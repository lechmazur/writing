<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's sincerity and rebellion are well-balanced, and his motivation to preserve traditions is clear and consistent. His dynamic nature ("constantly changing") adds depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eli's theorizing, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted passage and storm-laden atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing tension and mood. Sensory details (e.g., "fluttering sticky note") immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ivy, storms) and subtext (tradition as living). Emotional resonance is achieved, but the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in Eli's unconventional rebellion, though Virginia's "bitterness" leans slightly tropey. Language avoids purple prose but could risk more stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers thematically but could push cohesion further.</comment>
