<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's brooding nature and artistic frustration are clear, but his "theoretically spontaneous" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation to escape servitude is consistent, but his sudden leap into action lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from mundane chores to deciphering a cosmic code feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but sacrifices nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crater base and its eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (dust, light) are used effectively, though "murky tenderness" clashes slightly with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (glasses, dust) and the portal's thematic resonance are strengths, but the ending's emotional impact is muted by rushed execution. Subtext about artistic liberation is promising but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dust-code concept, but phrases like "webs of intrigue" and "murky tenderness" feel contrived. Some emotional beats lack nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the story feels like a sketch rather than a fully realized piece. The ending lingers but lacks depth.</comment>
