<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "sober cardsharp" trait feels underutilized beyond initial description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed in resolution; the ink well's power could be more organically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering, if slightly vague, impression.</comment>
