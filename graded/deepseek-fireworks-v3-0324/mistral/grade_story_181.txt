<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's dual life and motivation are clear, but his "blatantly secretive" nature feels underdeveloped. The flower's symbolism is strong, but his reaction to the kiss is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The transition from spice trader to lost-tech seeker lacks depth, and the kiss feels unearned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The market and sanctuary settings are vivid, but the bird sanctuary's connection to the plot is tenuous. Sensory details (spices, flower glow) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (flower, doodles) is strong, but the emotional payoff is shallow. The ending hints at depth but doesn’t fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (mysterious letter, kindred spirit). The flower’s glow feels contrived, and the kiss is clichéd.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but underdeveloped. The length feels limiting, not deliberate. The story hints at depth but doesn’t fully explore it.</comment>
