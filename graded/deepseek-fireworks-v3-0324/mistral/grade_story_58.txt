<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's loyalty and motivation are clear, but his "fiercely loyal" trait feels underdeveloped. The journal and meditation quest add depth, though his voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from turmoil to enlightenment. The comedic routine as a catalyst is inventive but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower and flickering lights create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Moths and storms are evocatively tied to Eli's inner conflict, though "sanctified dread" could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (moths, storms) and subtext. The ending resonates, but the comedic routine's impact feels overstated. Theme of balance is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("storms within"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the tone wobbles between dread and enlightenment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the tower and "radicalize" feel slightly forced. The length suits the story, leaving a lingering thought on inner peace.</comment>
