<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orion's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "lonesome" trait feels somewhat underdeveloped. His discovery with the stamp reveals depth, but his rivalry with tech-bards could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The stamp discovery drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The futuristic metropolis and rooftop stables create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but evocative, enhancing the contrast between tech and nature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (clouds, stamp) is strong, and the theme of unity is clear. However, the emotional impact could be deeper, and the ending, while satisfying, lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. The tone is consistent, though some phrases verge on overly poetic without adding depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements. The brevity works, but the thematic exploration could be richer.</comment>
