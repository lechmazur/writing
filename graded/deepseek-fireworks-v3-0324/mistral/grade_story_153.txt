<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "eternal" nature feels underdeveloped. His obsession with immortality is compelling but lacks deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The digitization of journals drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground city and eternal night create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective, enhancing the mood of isolation and pursuit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well (e.g., the headlamp). The ending is satisfying, but the theme of immortality could be explored with more depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (e.g., the lone scholar). The prose is purposeful, though some phrases feel overly formal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
