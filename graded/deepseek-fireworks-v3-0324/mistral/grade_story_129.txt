<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "somber troubadour" persona feels slightly underdeveloped. The ring's curse and his empathy arc are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels rushed. The cryptic stanzas device works well, but the pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned launch site is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are strong, though the "hushed euphoria" tone occasionally clashes with the somber setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional payoff could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (cursed heirloom, generational trauma). The writing avoids clich√©s but could be more daring in style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though some elements feel slightly forced. The brevity works, but the story could benefit from more thematic depth.</comment>
