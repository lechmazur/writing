<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edgar's cynicism and truth-curse are well-integrated, driving his actions and interactions. His motivation to provoke evolution is clear, though his transition to choice-driven truth could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the ritual's execution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing tightens near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The prize booth and bird migrations enrich the setting's eerie, layered tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry, moon) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Theme of evolution is consistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, though "tapestry of fate" leans generic. Nuanced handling of Edgar's curse, but occasional overly precise descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, with creative use of the park and pencil box. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on truth and choice.</comment>
