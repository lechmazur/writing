<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the manuscript discovery serving as a strong turning point, though the bird's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cave library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details ("dripping water," "rustle of parchment") enhancing the melancholic tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise, though the reaper trope risks clich√©. Language avoids purple prose but occasionally leans generic ("eternal twilight").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the brevity slightly undermines emotional weight. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>
