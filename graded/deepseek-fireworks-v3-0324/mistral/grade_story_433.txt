<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's hardheadedness and brokenness are clear, but his motivation for seeking solace feels somewhat generic. His actions align with his traits, but deeper nuance in his voice or reactions would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The prophecy drives the narrative, though its resolution (finding solace in the journey) is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gallery and snow-kissed setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the mood. Sensory details (e.g., fogged windowpanes, dusty tomes) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., "whisper of beauty") and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but some phrases ("wholeheartedly broken") verge on clich√©. The tone avoids purple prose but lacks daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering sense of renewal.</comment>
