<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's hesitance and awkwardness are clear but could be deeper. His motivation to restore balance is consistent but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the transition between worlds feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The geothermal vents and orchard enhance the atmosphere and action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (postcard, bridging worlds) and evocative prose. Ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (isolated swordsman, world-balance duty). Metaphors are fresh but could be more surprising.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of restoration.</comment>
