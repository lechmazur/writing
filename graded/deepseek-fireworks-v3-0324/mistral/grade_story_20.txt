<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, with his transformation from disappointment to determination well-articulated. His "anxiously calm" demeanor and the comb's symbolism deepen his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the roadside attraction detour feels slightly abrupt. The bridge confrontation resolves Eli's internal conflict effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial bodies create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the story's emotional weight. Sensory details like the mist are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, bridge) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the "passionate disinterest" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "heart a drumbeat of anticipation"). Minor stiffness in phrasing, but avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, leaving a lingering thematic impact. The comb and bridge elevate the narrative beyond its word limit.</comment>
