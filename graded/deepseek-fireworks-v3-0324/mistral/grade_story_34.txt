<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's emotional depth and motivation are clear, but his "objectively emotional" trait feels slightly forced. His actions align well with his longing for home.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels rushed. The concept of compromise is introduced abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The interdimensional lounge is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The amber pendant's glow enhances the atmosphere effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the ending's impact is slightly diluted by hurried execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (lost love, interdimensional travel). Some metaphors are fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit strains the thematic depth. Leaves a lingering thought about home.</comment>
