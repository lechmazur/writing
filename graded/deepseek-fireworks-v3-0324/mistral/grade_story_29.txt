<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's "clever naivety" is a compelling trait, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his hope-driven nature, but deeper introspection could elevate his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The jigsaw edge as a key to neutralizing the machine is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and flickering streetlamp create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "cryptic frequency" hum enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (machine of regrets, jigsaw edge) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some subtext could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (hopeful knight, ancient machine). The tone avoids purple prose, but some phrases feel overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though a touch more depth would elevate it further.</comment>
