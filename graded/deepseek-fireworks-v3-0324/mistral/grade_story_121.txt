<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on clich√©, and the circus caravans feel like a trope rather than a fresh twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but the length feels restrictive; some elements (like the circus) seem underdeveloped due to word count.</comment>
