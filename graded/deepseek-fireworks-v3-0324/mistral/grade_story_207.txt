<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His meek assertiveness and redemption arc are compelling, though his "forthright peddler" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the reliance on gossip columns as a method feels contrived. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station medical bay is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details. The greenhouse and bouquet enhance the setting's contrast and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism and emotional resonance, with a satisfying ending. However, some metaphors (e.g., the universe's "secret song") verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but occasional AI-like phrasing (e.g., "joyful loneliness") detracts. The theme of redemption is handled with nuance, though not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering impression, though the tight word limit slightly hampers depth.</comment>
