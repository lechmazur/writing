<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edmund's loneliness and exile are clear, but his "unintentionally iconic" status feels underdeveloped. His reaction to the mortar and pestle reveals hope, but his distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on a convenient snowstorm encounter. Pacing is tight, though the resolution feels abrupt for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the mortar's warmth) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (mortar as cure) is strong, but emotional resonance is surface-level. The ending hints at purpose but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is middling—exile and magical cure are familiar tropes. Some phrases ("dry leaves rustling") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its length. The mortar's introduction is creative, but the "familiar unknown" tone is unclear.</comment>
