<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is clear and aligns with his traits, but his "groggy brewer" attribute feels underutilized in driving deeper personality exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the protest subplot feels tangential to Edgar's personal arc, slightly diluting focus.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the haunted mansion's dread, though the graveyard setting is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, darkness) and emotional resonance, but the "flippant solemnity" tone clashes occasionally with the gravity of the themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (haunted mansion, inner turmoil manifesting physically), though the brewer angle offers mild freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the protest timeframe feels forced; the story’s strength lies in Edgar’s introspective journey, not external events.</comment>
