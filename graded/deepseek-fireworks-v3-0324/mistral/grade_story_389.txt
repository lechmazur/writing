<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear but his "formally casual" demeanor feels underdeveloped. His hunger for knowledge drives the plot, but his personality lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The urgency of the final hours adds tension, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with evocative sensory descriptions. The library and mine setting enhances the story's mood and stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (figurehead, fruit of knowledge) and a memorable ending. The theme of knowledge's cost is compelling, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (hungry scholar, cursed artifact). The tone is consistent, but some phrasing feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering question about the price of ambition.</comment>
