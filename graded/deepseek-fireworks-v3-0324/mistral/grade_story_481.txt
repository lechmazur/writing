<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's perceptive nature and cartographer background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "find his place in the universe" feels somewhat abstract and could be more concretely tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolic encounters (blacksmith, dragonfly) without fully grounding them in the futuristic hospital setting. The pacing is efficient but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital ward is underutilized; its sterility contrasts with the forge but lacks immersive detail. The "edgy nostalgia" tone is present but inconsistently supported by sensory descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dragonfly, forge) and thematic depth, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract resolution. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, but some phrases ("distantly intimate," "edgy nostalgia") feel contrived. The narrative avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for poetic effect.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story cohesively incorporates assigned elements, but the futuristic setting feels tacked on. The brevity works, though some themes could be explored more fully.</comment>
