<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alistair's stubbornness and motivation are clear, but his visual unappealingness feels underutilized in shaping his actions or interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed; the connection between the flute and the shipping label could be more organically developed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits emotional resonance. The premise lingers, but execution lacks polish.</comment>
