<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and compelling, but his role as a "guide" feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his prophecy-driven fear, but his profession could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the transition from hallway to beach is abrupt. The puzzle box and seashell are cleverly linked, driving the narrative forward logically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the seashell's labyrinthine interior and dying light enhancing the story's eerie beauty. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the box, the shell) and subtext (fate vs. agency). The ending is satisfying, though Eli's laugh feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The reversed-wishes twist is inventive, though the "sharp gentleness" tone occasionally wavers into inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
