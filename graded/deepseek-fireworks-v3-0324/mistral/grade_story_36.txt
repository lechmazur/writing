<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon's calm doomsayer persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "faithfully odd" rituals and skateboard use reinforce his defiance against stagnation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eamon's rituals, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The train whistle as a symbol of inevitability ties the narrative together effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and sunrise setting are richly detailed, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (whirring gears, train whistle) immerse the reader and support the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skateboard, train) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "loss of innocence" feels underdeveloped. Writing style enhances impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The steampunk-meets-doomsayer premise is fresh, and emotions are shown through action rather than stated. Minor overuse of "placid ferocity."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about defiance in the face of doom.</comment>
