<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's solitude and motivation are clear, but his "baron" status feels underdeveloped. His sign language use is a strong, unique trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the bottle discovery; the raft's introduction feels abrupt. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered, with eerie sensory details. Atmosphere deeply supports the story's mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (bottle as knowledge vessel) and subtext, but the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but "luminous doubt" and "visibly obscure" verge on overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though some (like the raft) feel tacked on. The brevity suits the mood but limits depth.</comment>
