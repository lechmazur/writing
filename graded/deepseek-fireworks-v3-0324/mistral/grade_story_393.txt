<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theodore's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. His actions align well with his alchemist traits and desperate hope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The coin's role is logical but could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. The tar pit and watchtowers create a strong atmosphere, though the suburban home feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (coin, cipher) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats could be shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (neglected balance, cryptic solutions). Language is purposeful, though some descriptors are generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the suburban home feels incongruous. The story lingers but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
