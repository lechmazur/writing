<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's headstrong nature and tenuously certain spirit are well-integrated, driving her actions and decisions convincingly. Her motivation to bring color back is clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from problem to resolution. The glitter-infusion method is inventive but slightly rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the glowing fruits and stained glass box enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (stained glass, glitter) and evocative imagery well, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity works, though some themes could be explored further.</comment>
