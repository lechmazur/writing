<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "skittish drifter" trait feels underdeveloped. The ballet shoes and his past as a dancer add depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed. The connection between the lunar setting and Eli's dance could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are used effectively, though the barbershop timeframe feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the theme of "summoning grace" could be more deeply explored. The ending is satisfying but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel overly polished. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the brief length limits deeper exploration. It leaves a lingering feeling but could benefit from more thematic depth.</comment>
