<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "familiarly unknown" quality feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed in places. The connection between Eli's encounters and the goddess's echo is logical but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The urban orchard is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mystical atmosphere. The setting and timeframe work well together.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the emotional impact is uneven. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality is present but hampered by occasional clich√©s ("whispering secrets"). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but some elements (e.g., "chaotic organization") don't fully integrate. The length suits the narrative, though depth is sacrificed.</comment>
