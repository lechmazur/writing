<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his "professionally wild" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his craft, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the quarantine and paddleboarding feels forced. Pacing is decent, but the ending resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ozone station setting is vivid, but the timeframe (child's first school day) is underutilized. Atmosphere supports the story well, though.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (flag) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The theme of freedom is present but not deeply explored. Writing style is polished but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”some fresh metaphors, but the paddleboarding element feels gimmicky. Tone shifts awkwardly in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its word limit rather than enhanced by it.</comment>
