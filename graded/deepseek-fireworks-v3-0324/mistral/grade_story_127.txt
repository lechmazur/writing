<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "secret" feels underdeveloped. The gauntlet connection to his past is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly rushed in resolution. The gauntlet's role in driving the arc is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge is vividly rendered, but coral reef texture feels forced. Atmosphere enhances Eli's introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (gauntlet as trust) works well, but emotional impact is muted by abrupt reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in combining steampunk and coral imagery, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("unbreakable bond").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the ending lacks nuance. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
