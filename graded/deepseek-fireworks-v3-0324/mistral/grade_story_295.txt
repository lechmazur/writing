<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thorne's "boldly reluctant" nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; his joviality feels inconsistent with the weight of his vow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the telescope's discovery feels abrupt, lacking buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch's herb garden is vividly rendered, but its "elegant mayhem" tone clashes slightly with Thorne's introspective arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism, though the ending's hopefulness verges on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (doubting hero, cosmic awe). Some phrasing feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the garden's role feels secondary to the telescope's thematic weight.</comment>
