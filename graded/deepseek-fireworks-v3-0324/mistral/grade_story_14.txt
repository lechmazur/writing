<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's gambling nature is well-integrated, but his naivety feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eli's gamble, though the midnight lectures feel slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal station and candlelit dinners create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle molds, tides) is strong, and the ending resonates. Some emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on gambling tropes. Writing avoids clich√©s but could push further in subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about bargains and fate.</comment>
