<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear but his "philosophically shallow" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his mission, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The pendant's role in driving the action is logical, but the resolution feels abrupt given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy is vividly imagined, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mystical tone. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (pendant, washcloth) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (magic artifact, diplomat ally). Some phrases feel overly formal or generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans heavily on its elements. The length feels constrained, not deliberate.</comment>
