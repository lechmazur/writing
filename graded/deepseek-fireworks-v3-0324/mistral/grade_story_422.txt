<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orion's selective mutism and ventriloquism are well-integrated, revealing depth through Cassio. His optimism and mission to archive weather patterns are clear and consistent, though his reaction to the storm could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the storm's resolution feels slightly rushed. The overheard phone call device works, but its execution could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (binary whispers, twin suns). The setting enhances the story's whimsical yet urgent tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (Cassio as voice/family) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some themes could be explored more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (rain falling upwards, crystal trees). Avoids clich√©s, though "euphoric agitation" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of warmth and resilience.</comment>
