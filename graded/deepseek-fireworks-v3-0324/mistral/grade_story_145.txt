<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "uncertainly certain" attribute feels slightly forced. The rosebud effectively symbolizes his lost love, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The echo test method is creative but underdeveloped. The arc is clear, but pacing suffers due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The castle ruin library and hidden world are evocatively described, but sensory details could be sharper. The atmosphere supports the tone well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (rosebud, echo test) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext. Writing style is polished but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”hidden worlds and secret societies are tropes, though the echo test adds freshness. Some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its length. The rosebud and reconquer motif linger, but depth is superficial.</comment>
