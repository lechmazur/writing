<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is clear and consistent, with his bookish nature and assassin role creating a compelling paradox. The rubber key cover effectively reveals his past and purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Edmund's nightmares, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned frequency monitoring station is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's tone. Sensory details like the flickering monitors immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nightmares, key cover) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>
