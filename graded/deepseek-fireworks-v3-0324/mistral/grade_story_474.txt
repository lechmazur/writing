<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his transformation feels rushed. Lyra's introduction adds depth, but her backstory is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the cooking class detour feels forced. The chessboard's role is compelling, though resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Celestial grotto and living shadows create vivid atmosphere, but "quiet rebellion" lacks tangible integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (chessboard, shadows) is strong, but emotional resonance is uneven. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise marred by tropes (rebel ally, ancient spirit). Some prose leans generic ("eyes as dark as shadows").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive, but cooking class and "familiar puzzle" tone feel tacked on. Chessboard mystery carries the narrative.</comment>
