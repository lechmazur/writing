<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's arc from underachiever to reclaimed sorcerer is compelling, but his motivation to "spring a trap on his own limitations" feels slightly abstract. His connection to the doll head is vivid, though his "exceptionally usual" trait isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the doll head effectively driving the narrative. The resolution feels earned, though the space station setting's relevance to the climax is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland create an intriguing contrast, but sensory details are sparse. The doll head's eerie presence is atmospheric, but the setting's potential isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll head as heritage) and a satisfying arc. The theme of self-redemption is clear, though the "bored excitement" tone could be sharper. The ending resonates emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise, but some tropes (prodigy-turned-failure, magical artifact) are familiar. The doll head's uniqueness elevates it, though the prose occasionally leans generic ("rush of power").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the space station feels incidental. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection on Eli's transformation. A tighter link between setting and theme would strengthen cohesion.</comment>
