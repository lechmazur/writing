<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon's sullenness and bias against technology are well-established, but his sudden shift to zest feels slightly abrupt. His stamp collection effectively reveals his longing for escape.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eamon's inspiration, though the submarine construction feels rushed. The arc from stagnation to resolve is clear but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly rendered, and the contrast between its decay and the stamp's vibrancy enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (stamps, quilt) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of erasing boundaries could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans slightly on tropes (isolated protagonist seeking escape). The writing avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors feel familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the word limit strains the pacing. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
