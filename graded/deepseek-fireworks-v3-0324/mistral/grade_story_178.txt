<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is clear and shifts believably, but his "overburdened clerk" trait feels underutilized beyond initial setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the trivia night transition feels abrupt. Pacing manages the word limit well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but some (stamp collection, trivia night) feel tangential to the core conflict.</comment>
