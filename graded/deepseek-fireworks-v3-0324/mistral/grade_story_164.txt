<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's wistfulness and blacksmith background are well-integrated, but his "drifting arrogance" feels slightly inconsistent with his otherwise gentle portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in the latter half, compressing the city's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is vividly rendered, and the contrast with Thorne's botanical work creates a compelling atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, though the phrase "obviously subtle" recurs awkwardly. The theme of reclaiming nature feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with a lingering sense of hope. The brevity works, but deeper exploration of Lyra's role would elevate it.</comment>
