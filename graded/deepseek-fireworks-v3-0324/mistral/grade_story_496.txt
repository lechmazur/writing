<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Edgar's repressed poet persona and secret terror of the wilderness are well-integrated, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on familiar beats (antique shop as catalyst). Pacing is strong, though the resolution is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown street and antique shop are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (perfume bottle as cosmic vessel) and lyrical prose. The ending resonates, though the theme of artistic rebirth is somewhat conventional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its imagery but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing (e.g., "heart a drumroll"). Nuanced emotion, but not wholly groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering impression, though the premise isnâ€™t entirely fresh.</comment>
