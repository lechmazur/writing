<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's "lukewarm" magic and "loyally peculiar" nature are well-integrated, but his motivation to "paint a future free from fear" feels slightly abstract. His actions align, but deeper introspection could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc from anticipation to resolution. The "clash" with intruders drives momentum, though the fog method feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar base and "charred serenity" tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (cold glow, flickering lights) enhance the mood, though the fog's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (echoes, fog) and subtext (fear vs. hope). The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown ("heart pounded with determination").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("lukewarm magic"), but "clinging to echoes" leans slightly tropey. The style avoids purple prose but occasionally over-explains emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the lunar base and Eli's magic serving the theme well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts could be deeper.</comment>
