<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's dry wit and motivation are clear, but his "reckless precision" feels underdeveloped. His voice is distinct but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Edgar's mission, though the dance metaphor feels forced. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly atmospheric, with effective sensory details. The rope and journal deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (rope, journal) and subtext (promises, legacy) enrich the story. The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by the clich√©d "haunted bedroom" and forced dance metaphor. Some phrases feel algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the dance motif detracts. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of duty and legacy.</comment>
