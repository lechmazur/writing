<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "bitterly optimistic" attribute is well-integrated, and her motivation to push scientific limits aligns with her backstory. However, her "lost heiress" status feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the parking stub revelation driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the scenic overlook detour feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alien sky and research station are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The cloud migration adds poetic weight to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (parking stub as key) and thematic depth (fragmentation vs. unity). The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sky as a river of cotton candy hues"). Minor AI-like phrasing in "reckless precision," but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the parking stub and unification arc standing out. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
