<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but somewhat simplistic; his transformation from naive to guardian feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on convenience (e.g., the statue's sudden wholeness). Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The virtual/physical duality is evocative, but sensory details are sparse beyond the humming statue.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (lullaby as bridge) is strong, but emotional resonance is undercut by abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (chosen-one arc, digital vs. real). Language avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the ending feels more like a setup than a complete arc. Lingers conceptually but not emotionally.</comment>
