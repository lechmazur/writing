<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gethin's druidic past and urban present are well-integrated, but his motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though his lethargic excitement could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from scavenging to theater feels abrupt. Pacing is effective, though the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon-lit alley and hologram repair shop create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., flickering holograms, dented tin) enhance the setting's liminal quality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lunch tin as toolbox) and subtext (bridging nature/tech). The ending is satisfying, but the theme of obligation could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original blending of druidic and cyberpunk elements avoids clich√©s. Some phrases ("lethargic excitement") verge on overused, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the story feels slightly constrained by its length. Leaves a lingering thought about urban renewal.</comment>
