<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's analytically innovative mind is well-integrated into his actions, but his "nondescript seer" trait feels underdeveloped. Motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The USB drive hunt drives the narrative, though the mythic relic's connection to justice could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details (rain scent, tower's decay). Setting enhances the story's mood, but the party's hush feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors, symbolism) are effective, but the theme of justice lacks depth. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”some fresh touches (rain scent method), but the USB drive as a mythic relic feels contrived. Emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story leans too heavily on the USB drive as a plot device. Length feels deliberate, though some themes could be richer.</comment>
