<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her diabolically benevolent nature driving her actions. Her growth under Morwen's mentorship is well-developed, though her initial "coy spy" trait could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from intrusion to reconciliation. The time-reversal method feels slightly contrived but serves the story's needs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The brewery setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The "borrowed valor" tone complements the world but could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the button) and subtext (mending fences). The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases verge on flowery, and the "coy spy" trope isn't fully subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of purpose, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>
