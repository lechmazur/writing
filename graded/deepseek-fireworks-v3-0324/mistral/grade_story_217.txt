<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ezra's rebellious nature and love for Creole cuisine are well-integrated, but his motivation to restore the park feels slightly abrupt. His "sadly joyful" demeanor is evocative but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the call-to-action lacks buildup. The word limit strains the arc, though the ending hints at potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The ephemeral gloom tone enhances atmosphere but occasionally overshadows character nuance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., cuisine as metaphor) are effective, but emotional impact is uneven. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending cuisine with decay, but some tropes (rebels, haunted parks) feel familiar. Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the story leans on assigned pieces rather than fully transcending them. Lingering potential, but not flawless.</comment>
