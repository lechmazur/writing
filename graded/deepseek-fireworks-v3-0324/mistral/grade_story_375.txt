<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "smiling saboteur" trait feels underdeveloped. His interactions with the mannequins reveal depth, though his "angry peace" could be explored more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between Kael's goal and his realization is logical but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are effective, though the "abandoned radio tower city" could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the dialogue is occasionally stiff. The theme of imperfection is compelling, though the ending could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. However, some phrases border on overly poetic, and the "angry peace" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the length feels restrictive. The elements serve the narrative, though some (like the mannequins) could be more tightly woven.</comment>
