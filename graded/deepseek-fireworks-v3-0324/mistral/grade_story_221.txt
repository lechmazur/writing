<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edmund's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His rebellion and emotional thawing are compelling, though his ghost-whispering gift feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The amber discovery effectively drives the narrative, though the family tradition's role could be more tightly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered and enhances the melancholic tone. Sensory details are evocative, though the timeframe ("between the lines of a half-written letter") feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story employs strong symbolism (amber, ghosts) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on clich√© ("frozen heart").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids AI tropes and feels original, though the "joyfully melancholic" tone occasionally clashes with the rebellion theme. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of liberation.</comment>
