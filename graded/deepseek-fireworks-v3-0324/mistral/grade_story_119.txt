<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his astral projection ability feels underutilized in shaping his actions. The key and compassion are well-integrated, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the flee action, but the sun-shadow method feels contrived. Pacing is tight, though the ending lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly atmospheric, but the roller coaster track's connection to the key and compassion is tenuous. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (key, shadows) is effective, but the theme of compassion feels overstated. The ending lacks emotional punch. Writing style is polished but safe.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (chosen-one lineage, abandoned carnival). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("unyielding compassion" repeated). Emotional nuance is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not transformative. The length feels limiting, not deliberate. The story lacks lingering impact.</comment>
