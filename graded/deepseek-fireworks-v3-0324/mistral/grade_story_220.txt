<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's aloofness and curiosity are well-established, but his motivation to "pierce illusions" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc. The "unexpected delay" device is functional but could be more organic. The ending resolves satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The "wounded season" and fog enhance the atmosphere, though the labyrinth's connection to the logbook could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "innovative nostalgia") are effective, and the theme of curiosity vs. the unknown resonates. The ending lingers, though the conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases ("predictably odd") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity works, though a deeper exploration of "reclaiming power" would elevate it.</comment>
