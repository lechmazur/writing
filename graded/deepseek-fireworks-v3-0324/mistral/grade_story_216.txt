<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt. His "robustly delicate" nature is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the midnight calls and washer discovery feel contrived. The arc is satisfying, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cloud city and library are vividly rendered, but the "last library card" detail lacks deeper integration. Atmosphere is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism and theme are compelling, but the ending's emotional punch could be sharper. Literary craft is polished.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "cryptic phone calls" trope is overused. Nuanced handling of obsession elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the tight word limit slightly rushes Eamon's revelation. Lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
