<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unusually normal" attribute feels underdeveloped. His con artist background and rebellion arc are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ghost's role feels slightly rushed but drives the rebellion effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details. The gray crops and ghostly apparition enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (tape dispenser). The ending is purposeful, though the ghost's exposition could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on some dystopian tropes. The tape dispenser and ghost interactions feel fresh, but the prose occasionally slips into predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, though the ghost's backstory could be more integrated.</comment>
