<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his subdued nature could be more deeply explored. The wooden bead adds a nice touch but his "artfully clumsy" attribute feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the mirror's arcane method feels slightly contrived. The connection between Eli's day job and nighttime mission could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area is vividly rendered, and the "screaming silence" tone enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the mirror's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext about redemption. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict with Victor lacks depth due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on vigilante tropes. The mirror tracking is unique, but some phrasing feels formulaic ("haunted by the ghosts of his past").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the ancient art motif could be more central. Leaves a lingering thought about justice, but the elements donâ€™t all feel equally essential.</comment>
