<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "random philosopher" label feels underdeveloped. His numb fascination is compelling but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The ritual's execution lacks buildup, and the sacrifice's impact is underexplored within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Jazz Age setting is evocative but underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., numbness) are strong, but the "time capsule" concept isn't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, mug) is effective, but the ending feels abrupt. The theme of obsession vs. curiosity is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is middling—cosmic rituals and numb fascination aren't groundbreaking. The prose avoids clichés but lacks stylistic distinction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its length. The cosmic wonder theme lingers but isn't fully realized.</comment>
