<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from spineless to courageous is clear, but his initial motivation (money) feels shallow. Elara's mentorship is a strong catalyst, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the prophecy's resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is solid, though the forgotten trails could be more integral to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The map projection room and trails are evocatively described, but "luminous doubt" isn't fully woven into the atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (key, prophecy) is strong, but the theme of self-discovery is somewhat surface-level. The ending satisfies, though the prose occasionally tells rather than shows.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (mentor archetype, prophecy). Some phrases feel formulaic ("grandly trivial"), but the dollhouse key is a fresh touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story leans too heavily on assigned prompts. The length feels deliberate, though the theme could linger more.</comment>
