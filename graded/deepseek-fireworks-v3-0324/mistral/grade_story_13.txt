<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's solemnity and dysfunction are clear, but his motivation feels slightly abstract. His connection to the garden's evolutionary changes is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the poems, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The arc is clear but could benefit from more nuanced pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the clock tower and shifting sands creating a strong atmosphere. The laboratory's chaos contrasts well with the garden's serenity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (frozen clock, shifting sands) are effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Elias's dysfunction is handled with nuance, but the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity works, but some ideas (e.g., evolutionary tracking) could be more fully realized.</comment>
