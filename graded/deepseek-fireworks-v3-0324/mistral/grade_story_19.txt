<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's wild, instinctual nature is well-conveyed, but her motivation to embrace the unknown feels slightly abstract. The brass scale adds depth, but her "feral" aspect could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the receipt discovery, though the transition to the scale's revelation feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dandelion field and golden light create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The setting enhances the tone of hopeful melancholy beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (scale, receipts) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional resonance leans slightly toward telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept, but some phrases ("hopeful melancholy") verge on clich√©. The code-in-receipts idea is fresh, though its execution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the scale's secret could be more impactful.</comment>
