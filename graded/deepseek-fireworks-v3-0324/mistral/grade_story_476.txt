<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thaddeus is vividly drawn, with his gentle brawler persona and chronicler role well-integrated. His motivation is clear, though his "gentle brawler" trait could be more actively demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the flat tire feels like a minor contrivance. The echo chamber revelation is effective but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (spices, echoes) enhancing the setting. The echo chamber and rural highway work well together.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spice box, echo chamber) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The spice box and echo chamber are fresh metaphors. Some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering thought, though the word limit slightly constrains depth.</comment>
