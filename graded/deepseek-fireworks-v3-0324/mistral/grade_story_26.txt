<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his shame, but his "sleep-deprived" trait feels underutilized beyond surface-level description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bell's pattern driving the resolution elegantly. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The shed's rusted texture and radio hum stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (DNA-strand bell, pulsating fruits) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open to interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though "singularly plural" feels slightly forced. The cyberpunk-orchard fusion is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression of acceptance.</comment>
