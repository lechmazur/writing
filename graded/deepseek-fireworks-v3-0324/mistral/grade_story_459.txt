<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is clear and consistent, with his ghost-seeing ability driving his actions. His "elegantly clumsy" demeanor adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sand castle lab and ghost tours create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the dried flower crown) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (flower crown = eternal waiting). The ending is satisfying, though some subtext could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of silence as dissonance is fresh, though a few phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of redemption, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
