<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's cosmic powers and academic wildness are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation to break free is clear but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ritual and terrace scenes drive the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a vivid, atmospheric setting. Sensory details are sparse but evocative, enhancing the mood of ordered disarray.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (brooch, abyss) well and has emotional resonance. The theme of breaking free is clear, though the execution leans slightly toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but some tropes (chosen one, familial legacy) are familiar. The cosmic powers and ritual feel fresh, but the prose occasionally slips into generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but deeper exploration of Edgar's powers and world would elevate it further.</comment>
