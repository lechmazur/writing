<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's "angrily peaceful" nature is intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear, but his shift from resentment to passion feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on convenience (USB drive discovery). The pacing is tight, though the resolution with the injured woman feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like the "misty breath" and "crumbling attractions" immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion but relies on familiar tropes (lonely genius, hidden knowledge). The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is middling—Eli’s character and the park setting stand out, but the USB drive and hacker elements feel contrived. Some phrasing leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but doesn’t fully transcend its assigned elements. The length feels deliberate, though the emotional payoff could be stronger.</comment>
