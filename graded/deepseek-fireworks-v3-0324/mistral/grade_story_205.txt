<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's cynical perspective and delicate warrior persona are well-integrated, but her motivation to "sow laughter" feels slightly underdeveloped given the high stakes of her secret.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action of "incorporating" the secret, though the method (corroded cameo) could be more logically explained within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The swamp setting and fireflies create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the connection between the seaweed and the setting could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seaweed, cameo) and evocative prose, but the emotional impact of the secret's fate isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (warrior with a secret). The cynical voice is fresh, but some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, though the story feels constrained by the word limit. The ending lingers but lacks full thematic resonance.</comment>
