<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The comic serves as a strong catalyst, but his "passive conspirator" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the quantum foam's role in the climax is underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the resolution could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but evocative. The atmosphere supports Edgar's journey well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comic, quantum foam) and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional impact could be sharper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("dance with destiny"). Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, though the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. A few forced metaphors slightly weaken the whole.</comment>
