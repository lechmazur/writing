<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's boredom and shapeshifting abilities are well-integrated, but her "intelligently foolish" nature feels underdeveloped. Her motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The figurine's discovery and theft drive the story effectively, though the taxi ride feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and post-empire setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like the hum of ancient magic are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and uses symbolism well (e.g., the figurine as a key). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of cosmic balance could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel slightly generic. Lyra's emotional depth is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of potential, though the brevity limits deeper exploration.</comment>
