<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, but his "torn visionary" aspect feels underdeveloped. His stubborn optimism is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the artifact hunt, though the cellphone's introduction slightly disrupts pacing. The ending resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the "careful wildness" tone isn't fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (artifact, library) and subtext, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. The ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "cellphone from 1920" risks gimmickry. Avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
