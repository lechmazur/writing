<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and consistent, but his noble background feels underutilized in shaping his actions beyond surface eccentricity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over progression; the ticket stub method feels underexplored for driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lab setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe ("between text messages") lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The drone's role as a thematic device is memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("spark of secrets"). The tone wavers between fresh and overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the lab setting and ticket stubs feel slightly disjointed. The brevity suits the introspective focus.</comment>
