<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation from city planner to prepper feels slightly abrupt. His obsession with broken constellations effectively reveals his inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The handshake pivot is intriguing but underdeveloped. The arc from chains to liberation is clear but could benefit from more nuanced transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the worn stones and ink blotter deepen immersion, though the city's "ancient and modern" contrast is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally. Some telling ("he felt liberated") weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on familiar tropes (temple as sanctuary, fractured stars as metaphor). Prose avoids purple tendencies but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the handshake and prepper backstory feel tacked on. The brevity works, but deeper exploration of Edmund's past would elevate it.</comment>
