<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and personal, but her "unlucky" trait feels underdeveloped. Her resolve and curiosity are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The sparring metaphor for truth is compelling, though the shortcut setup is thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmosphere elevate the setting. The phosphorescent flora and lizard people are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("bitter honey") and subtext. Ending is purposeful, though dialogue leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, but the lizard person's dialogue borders on tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the "colliding interests" timeframe feels tacked on. Leaves a lingering thematic question.</comment>
