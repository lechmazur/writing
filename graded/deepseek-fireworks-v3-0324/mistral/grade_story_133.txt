<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's jaded nature and motivation to preserve hunting methods are clear, but his transition to accepting the prophecy feels slightly abrupt. Isolde's menacing charm is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the prophecy and throne concept could be better integrated. Pacing suffers slightly due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and colonial town are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like the "fragrant blossoms" are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., symbolism of the throne) are present but could be deeper. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, though some phrases verge on flowery. The premise avoids clich√©s, but Isolde's backstory feels generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but slightly constrained by its elements. The length feels deliberate, though some themes could be expanded.</comment>
