<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's literal mind is well-integrated into his actions and problem-solving, but his "bright-eyed" trait feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but lacks deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The phone booth key as a cipher is inventive, but the transition from discovery to resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and post-war setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like "eerie whispers" add depth, though the basement's "secrets" could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key as cipher) and thematic depth (curiosity as survival). The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (constellations as coordinates). Avoids clich√©s, though the "haunted" element leans slightly generic. Nuanced handling of curiosity and discovery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic resonance, though Eli's literal-mindedness could be explored more deeply.</comment>
