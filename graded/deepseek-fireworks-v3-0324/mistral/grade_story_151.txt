<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her scientific curiosity with emotional resilience. Her distinct voice shines through, though her awe could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the moral dilemma resolution feels slightly rushed. The veil-to-constellation leap is inventive but could use more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the frozen, melancholic atmosphere. The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are brilliantly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (veil, idol) and thematic depth, though the ending’s hope feels somewhat abrupt. The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, though the climax could linger longer for impact.</comment>
