<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Edmund's submissive nature and silent empathy are well-integrated into his actions, though his aristocratic status feels slightly underutilized in shaping his decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from gardening to espionage, but the transition feels abrupt. The word limit constraints slightly hinder a smoother arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse and workshop settings are vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (humidity, chirping) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story balances emotional resonance with subtle literary devices (e.g., the serum as symbolism). The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the spy-aristocrat duality, though some phrasing leans formulaic ("heart full of silent empathy"). Nuanced emotion elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the brevity slightly undermines thematic depth. The story feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
