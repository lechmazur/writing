<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eolande's dry-tongued bard persona is vividly rendered, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His actions align well with his desire to escape self-doubt, though his "gorgeously awkward" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to liberation. The voicemails as a method of preservation drive the narrative effectively, though the mushroom hall's role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is lush and immersive, with the prism and mushroom hall creating a magical atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, though the "dreamless night" could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and literary craft. Symbolism (prism, cloak of doubt) is deftly handled, and the ending is satisfying. The theme of self-acceptance resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The voice avoids clich√©s, though the "crisp languor" tone feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story beautifully. The brevity enhances its impact, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
