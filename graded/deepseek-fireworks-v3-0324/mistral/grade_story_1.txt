<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's phobia-ridden nature and stunt double background are intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation to dance on the edge of madness is clear, but his transformation feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The net's unraveling drives the narrative effectively, though the garage sale introduction feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a pyramid is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the eerie silence. The setting and object (net) are meaningfully connected, enriching the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (net as inner knots) and subtext are strong, though the ending's emotional impact is slightly diluted by Edgar's sudden shift. Literary devices are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (e.g., ancient artifact as catalyst). The writing avoids purple prose but occasionally feels overly precise rather than vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative well. The length feels deliberate, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>
