<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's quiet deserter persona and motivation are clear, but his "dizzyingly grounded" attribute could be more deeply explored to enhance his contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the orchid-to-mask transition feels slightly abrupt. The resolution, however, ties the arc together effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forest lab setting is vividly atmospheric, and the plant whispers add a haunting, immersive layer. The mask's discovery could be more organically tied to the environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (mirror, mask) and emotional resonance, though the "noble foolishness" tone occasionally clashes with the story's introspective weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "whispering secrets in their silent language"). Minor risk of over-poeticizing Eli's introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The brevity serves the theme, but some elements (e.g., jigsaw puzzles) feel underutilized.</comment>
