<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and poetic, but her "traditionally creative" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her cosmic role, but her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric whimsy over concrete cause-and-effect. The ending resolves neatly, though the middle lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with stellar sensory details. The solar wind collection point and cosmic tone elevate the story's uniqueness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, though the brevity limits thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering, if faint, emotional resonance.</comment>
