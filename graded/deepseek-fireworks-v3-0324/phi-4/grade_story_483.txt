<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'world-weary sheriff' archetype feels slightly underdeveloped for such a high-concept narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels somewhat rushed given the weight of the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the lava lamp meditation room and road trips creating a strong sense of place and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, though the emotional impact could be deeper with more nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is present but leans on familiar tropes (weary lawman seeking freedom). Some phrases verge on flowery without adding depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, but the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
