<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear but his rebellious nature feels underdeveloped. His reaction to the flower reveals depth, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The flower's introduction drives the story, yet the laundromat scene feels abrupt. Pacing suffers slightly from word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The study's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "haunting delight" tone clashes with the laundromat setting. Sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (flower, study) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, emotional resonance is muted by telling over showing. Theme of unity is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (wise stranger, prophetic mission). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("glimmering transitions"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some feel forced (laundromat). Style is clear, yet the storyâ€™s brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a faint lingering impression.</comment>
