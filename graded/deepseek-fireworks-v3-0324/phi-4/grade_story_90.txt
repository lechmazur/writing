<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorne's contrition and transformation are clear, but his motivation to unmask the pretender feels somewhat generic. His softened demeanor contrasts well with his past rigidity, though deeper introspection could enhance his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on familiar tropes. The storyteller's yarn effectively advances the plot, though the resolution feels rushed. Pacing is decent within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating island spa is vividly imagined, but its whimsy clashes slightly with the story's darker themes. Sensory details are sparse but effective when present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is muted by predictable beats. Symbolism (monocle, potion) is present but underdeveloped. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (charismatic pretender, cursed swordsman). The tone wobbles between whimsy and intrigue. Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story feels constrained by its length. The premise is creative, though execution leans toward convention.</comment>
