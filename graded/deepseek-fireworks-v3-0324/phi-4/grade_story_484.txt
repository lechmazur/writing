<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his brewer background feels underutilized. His transformation is compelling but lacks deeper exploration of his initial state.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ritual initiation drives the story effectively, though the protest backdrop feels slightly detached.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset. The haunted mansion graveyard is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror shard, darkness) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of self-discovery could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("guardian of the light within"). Emotional resonance is achieved but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative well. Leaves a lingering impression of resilience and transformation.</comment>
