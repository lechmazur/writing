<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness and orphan status are well-integrated, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The stones and lottery ticket effectively reveal his inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the gravitational anomaly's role could be clearer in driving the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garage and anomaly create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (whispers, stones) enhance immersion, though the anomaly's physics are vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (stones, ticket) and emotional resonance, but the anomaly's thematic connection to courage could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but the "adapt or perish" message leans clich√©. The stones and anomaly feel fresh, though Eli's arc is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the anomaly's purpose is underdeveloped. The ending lingers, but the theme could be sharper.</comment>
