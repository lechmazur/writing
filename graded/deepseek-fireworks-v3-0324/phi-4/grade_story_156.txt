<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "confused diplomat" trait feels underdeveloped. The spare computer key is a strong symbol, but her diplomatic role lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts ("counterpoint of hearts," "evolutionary wisdom") without enough grounding. The bird motif is poetic but feels forced as a method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the "subterranean village" concept isn't fully explored. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (computer key, birds) and a satisfying arc, but the theme of "liberalize" is vague. The ending resonates, though some metaphors feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans into abstract phrasing ("joyfully tragic," "counterpoint of hearts") without enough concrete nuance. Tone shifts awkwardly between poetic and literal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends elements, but some feel contrived (birds as a method). The length suits the narrative, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
