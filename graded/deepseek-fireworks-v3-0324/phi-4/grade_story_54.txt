<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's even-tempered nature and systematic rebelliousness are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the offloading action, but the star-tracking method feels underutilized. The letter subplot adds emotional weight but slightly disrupts pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's atmosphere, though the "vibrations of intent" concept feels disconnected from the physical space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scarf, stars) and evocative prose, but the theme of regret vs. purpose could be more sharply defined. Ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though "elegant chaos" and "vibrations of intent" verge on overwrought. Avoids clich√©s but risks stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the star-tracking method and unsent letter feel tacked on. Length is well-managed, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
