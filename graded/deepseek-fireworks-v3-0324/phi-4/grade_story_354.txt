<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "daring compassion" feels underdeveloped; her ethereal nature is well-integrated but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the bear's ricochet feels abrupt; the portal resolution ties the arc neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly rendered, and the aurora imagery enhances the atmosphere, though the "load cycles" could be more immersive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional; the ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
