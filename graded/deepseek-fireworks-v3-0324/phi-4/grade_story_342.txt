<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's dreamy nature and motivation to archive patterns are clear, but his "careless" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his motivation, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from confusion to liberation. The postcards as maps are a clever device, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The enchanted grove and labyrinth are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the story's mood and themes, though the "twisted orchard" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism and subtext, with memorable imagery. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (enchanted labyrinths, borrowed memories). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>
