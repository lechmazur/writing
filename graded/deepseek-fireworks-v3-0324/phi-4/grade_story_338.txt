<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her detachment feels slightly underdeveloped. Her "zany" nature could be more vividly shown through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The rotary phone method feels underutilized as a plot driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "time folding" concept is intriguing but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending is somewhat predictable. The theme of beauty in the mundane is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into familiar tropes (e.g., the "eccentric loner"). Some metaphors feel overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but the word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The elements serve the narrative well.</comment>
