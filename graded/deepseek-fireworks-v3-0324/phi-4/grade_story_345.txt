<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Father Thomas's lapsed faith and confusion are well-integrated into his actions and reflections, though his "unapologetically confused" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the snow-pattern method feels underdeveloped as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard's surreal atmosphere is richly evoked, though the "dull radiance" tone occasionally clashes with the setting's mystical potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (abacus, orchard) and thematic depth, but some metaphors verge on overused ("shadows danced with the light").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar spiritual crisis tropes; the abacus symbolism is fresh, but the jogging motif feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the snow patterns and jogging action slightly disrupt the story's gravity.</comment>
