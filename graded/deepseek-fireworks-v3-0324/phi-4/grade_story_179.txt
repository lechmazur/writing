<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's confidence and gentle demeanor are well-established, but his motivation to hush envy feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his role, but the "voice of envy" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to transformation. The fingerprint method is inventive, though its connection to mobilizing bees could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The coloring sessions and honeycomb imagery create a strong sense of place.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance and thematic depth are strengths, though some symbolism (e.g., the ruler) feels slightly forced. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (yearning watchman, hive harmony). The fingerprint method is fresh, but "jubilant remorse" feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity works. The story lingers but could delve deeper into Eli's duality.</comment>
