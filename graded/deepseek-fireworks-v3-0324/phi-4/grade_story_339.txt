<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her joylessness feels slightly underdeveloped. The drawer knob and seesaw metaphor add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The construction backdrop feels underutilized as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prismatic lake is vividly rendered, but the construction noise fades too abruptly, missing a chance to deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the resolution leans slightly toward cliché. The prose is elegant but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (guilt, performer's emptiness). The seesaw metaphor feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, but the elements don’t fully transcend their assigned roles. The length suits the story well.</comment>
