<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's paradox of being "strongly weak" is intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation to track social changes is clear but feels slightly detached from his personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but leans heavily on abstract imagery. Levitation as a method feels whimsical yet lacks concrete ties to the urban legends he tracks.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, blending ancient and modern seamlessly. The ink pot's Celtic knots and the village's atmosphere enhance the story's mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink pot, strands of courage) is strong, but the theme of "jubilant despair" wobbles between poignant and overwrought. The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the reimagined Celtic village and Eamon's levitation, but some phrases ("whirlwind of thoughts") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is present but inconsistently shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the brevity limits depth. The story lingers but could benefit from sharper thematic focus.</comment>
