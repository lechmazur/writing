<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear but his reckless nature feels underdeveloped; the paperclip usage is inventive but lacks deeper character insight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the connection between razing boundaries and video comparison feels strained; pacing is solid for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story's brevity limits thematic depth; the ending hints at resonance without fully delivering.</comment>
