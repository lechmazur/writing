<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "mild zealot" trait feels underdeveloped. Her connection to the foreign money is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The visualization sequence is effective, though the resolution leans toward clich√©.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, though the laboratory setting feels tacked on. The length suits the narrative.</comment>
