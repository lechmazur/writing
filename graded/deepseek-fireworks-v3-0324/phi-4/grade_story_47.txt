<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "eagerly jaded" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. The glove and voice notes reveal her depth, but her "dutiful ward" role lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The voice notes drive the mystery effectively, though the auditions as a backdrop feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" setting is evocative but underdeveloped. Sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glove, voice notes) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (mysterious heirlooms, cryptic messages). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, though some themes could be more nuanced.</comment>
