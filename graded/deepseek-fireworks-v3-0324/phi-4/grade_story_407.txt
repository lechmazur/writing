<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her traits, but her "unluckiness" feels underdeveloped. Zorak's character is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The sextant's role is compelling, but the sparring feels abrupt. Pacing is decent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underground setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the lizard people's culture could be richer. Sensory details are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (sextant, bitter honey) is strong, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (unlikely friendship, relic as key). Some phrases feel repetitive ("systematically chaotic").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements mesh well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The theme of connection is clear but not groundbreaking.</comment>
