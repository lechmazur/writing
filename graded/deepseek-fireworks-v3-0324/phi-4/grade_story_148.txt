<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his transition from storm chaser to carousel restorer feels slightly abrupt. His "eagerly unwilling" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the tapestry and carousel restoration could be stronger. The ending resolves neatly but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alpine monastery setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (tapestry, carousel) is well-integrated, but emotional resonance is occasionally stated rather than shown. The theme of resilience is clear but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is middling—the storm chaser trope is familiar, and the decoding of threads feels contrived. Some phrases verge on cliché ("inner resilience shining through").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but the elements feel slightly forced together. The length suits the narrative, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
