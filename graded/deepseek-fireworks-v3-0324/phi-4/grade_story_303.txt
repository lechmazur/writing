<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara and Kai are distinct but their motivations could be deeper. Their connection feels organic, though Kai's linguist role is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows well with a clear arc, but the interdimensional portal's role is vague. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with spices as a standout detail. The portal's atmosphere is evocative but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spices as worlds) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "dignified chaos" tone wobbles. Sensory details are fresh, though some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the portal's logic is fuzzy.</comment>
