<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness and cartographer background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "learn the language of the soul" feels slightly abstract. Lila's presence adds depth, though their shared kayaking passion is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the futuristic mall setting feels underused. The tile's significance drives the narrative, though the resolution is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The contrast between the mall's sterility and the shop's warmth is effective, but the futuristic elements are superficial. Sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the tile) and subtext (memory as connection). The ending is poignant, though the dialogue leans toward exposition. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of futuristic and nostalgic tones, but the kayaking element feels tacked on. Some phrases verge on clich√© ("language of the soul"). Nuanced emotions save it from being generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves most elements, but the mall setting and kayaking feel forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering emotional impact, though some themes are underexplored.</comment>
