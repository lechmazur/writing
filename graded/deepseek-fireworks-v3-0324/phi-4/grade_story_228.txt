<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and herbalist background are well-integrated, but her motivation could be more nuanced. The clothespin as a symbol is effective but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the storm's role feels abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bunker and storm create a vivid atmosphere, though the "hushed turbulence" tone isn't fully sustained. Sensory details are strong but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism and emotional resonance are handled well, but the theme of regeneration is somewhat heavy-handed. The ending lingers but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is solid, though the storm-as-metaphor is familiar. The prose avoids clichés but occasionally leans into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tight constraints, but the bunker setting feels underutilized. The story’s brevity works to its advantage.</comment>
