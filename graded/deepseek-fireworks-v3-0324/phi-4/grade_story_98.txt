<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's faintheartedness and intimate distance are intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation to learn ancient writings is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the connection between the plastic ruler and the tapestry feels forced. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chamber's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "dog walking" timeframe feels disjointed. Sensory details enhance immersion, though the setting-concept link is weak.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ruler, tapestry) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, emotional resonance is muted, and the theme of security is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (secret society, ancient knowledge). Some phrases feel flowery or generic, though the tapestry metaphor is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively combined, but the story feels constrained by its length. The plastic ruler's significance is creative but not fully realized.</comment>
