<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's curse and motivation are clear, but Clara's stagnation feels slightly underdeveloped. His "politely vindictive" nature shines, though her transformation could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed in Clara's arc. The moon phases as a method are poetic but underutilized in driving tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted park is vividly atmospheric, though the prize booth's connection to Elias's curse could be tighter. Sensory details excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the ending's hope feels abrupt. Dialogue is purposeful, though Clara's realization lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but "tapestry of fate" leans clich√©. Avoids AI tropes, though some emotional beats are stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the word limit strains Clara's evolution. The vintage pencil box is a standout detail.</comment>
