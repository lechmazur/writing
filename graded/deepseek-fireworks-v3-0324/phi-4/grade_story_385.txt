<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "openly manipulative" trait feels underdeveloped. The rusted ice skates add intrigue but her meddling nature isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the skates and symbols feels tenuous. Pacing is strong, though the beach wanderer metaphor disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hospital ward and obsidian skyscraper create a striking contrast. Sensory details (crackling pages, dawn light) enhance atmosphere, but the skyscraper's relevance is unclear.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (skates as perseverance) is effective, but the beach wanderer metaphor feels forced. Ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©s ("tangled web of curiosity"). Some phrases feel AI-generated ("lucid confusion"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the skyscraper and beach wanderer feel tacked on. The brief length works, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
