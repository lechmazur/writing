<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finch's spinelessness and mercenary background are subtly woven into his hesitancy and reliance on shadows, but his motivation to "hush a prophecy" feels slightly abstract. The key's contrast with his rough hands is a strong detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mentor's cryptic guidance, though the prophecy's mechanics remain vague. Pacing is tight, and the arc from doubt to determination works well within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The map projection room and stained-glass light create a vivid, atmospheric setting. "Luminous doubt" is embodied beautifully in the sensory details, enhancing the story's mood and Finch's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key, maps) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of small steps leading to grand journeys is poignant, though the prophecy's resolution is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in its blending of mercenary and mystical elements, but some phrases ("grandly trivial") verge on overwrought. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for poetic effect.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the key and mentor anchoring the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on silence and exploration.</comment>
