<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's assertively meek demeanor is well-integrated, but his motivation to escape feels slightly underdeveloped given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the firework and Eli's decision feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis is vividly rendered, and sensory details (golden sand, fireworks) enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gold threads, card) and emotional resonance, though the ending's hope feels slightly unearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "xenialize"), but the tech theme leans generic. Avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity slightly undermines thematic depth. Still, it lingers.</comment>
