<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lucien's motivation is clear but his "disinterested passion" feels slightly contradictory. His actions align with his traits, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the science fair encounter feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the vault's role as a sanctuary could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is evocative, but the connection between the stained-glass fragment and the setting could be deeper. Sensory details are effective but sparse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but the elements sometimes serve the plot rather than enrich it. The length works, but depth is occasionally sacrificed.</comment>
