<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear but his "coy malevolence" feels underdeveloped. The spy gadget pen adds intrigue, but his transformation lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The movie tradition feels tacked on, disrupting pacing. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but the arc lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—evocative sensory details ("gifts of the fog," falling stars) immerse the reader. Setting and tone align well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (pen, stars) is heavy-handed. Emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. The ending resolves neatly but lacks resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality falters with clichés ("tapestry of fate"). Some phrases feel AI-generated ("strategic spontaneity"). Nuance in emotion is absent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under word limits. The movie tradition feels forced. Style is ornate yet functional.</comment>
