<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bartender's jaded yet optimistic duality is compelling, but his transition feels slightly abrupt. The scalpel as a symbol is effective, but his method (doodles) lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the connection between doodles and globalizing destiny feels forced. Pacing is tight, though the climax (fireworks) overshadows the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The laboratory and fireworks create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere. Sensory details (crystals, explosions) enhance mood, but the scalpel's presence in this setting isn't fully justified.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (scalpel, fireworks) is strong, but the theme of "challenging fate" is stated more than shown. The ending is hopeful but leans into clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (disillusioned seeker, fate-carving). Doodles-as-destiny is fresh, but execution lacks nuance. Prose occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the story feels like it strains to fit them all. The length suits the arc, though some ideas beg deeper exploration.</comment>
