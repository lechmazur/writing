<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's "patiently impatient" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation is clear, but his reactions to the button box feel somewhat generic. The character's voice is distinct but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the button box, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between timelines is compelling, though the resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The broken planetarium/night club contrast enhances the atmosphere, though the timeline crossing could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (button box, mirrors) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some literary devices feel overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (time manipulation, inherited mystery). The writing avoids purple prose but lacks deeper subtext. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the length feels limiting. Elements serve the narrative well, though some combinations (welder in a nightclub) strain logic.</comment>
