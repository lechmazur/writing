<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "practical bard" trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her desire to protect wisdom.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The hidden compartment and diary reveal drive the story effectively, though the screw's role could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine library is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The street fairs add contrast but feel slightly disconnected from the main setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and wonder, with effective symbolism (the screw as a key). The ending is satisfying, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (hidden diaries, chosen guardians). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, though some ideas could be expanded.</comment>
