<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rajiv's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The ink blotter symbolism is strong, but his "rare authenticity" attribute isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the handshake moment feels underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, but the "broken constellations" method lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. However, the connection between the ink blotter and the temple could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, but the ending leans slightly toward clich√©. The theme of liberation is well-conveyed, though some metaphors feel overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing. The "daring caution" tone is uneven, and some descriptions verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but the handshake and constellations feel underutilized.</comment>
