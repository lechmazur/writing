<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear but her attribute ("intelligently foolish curiosity") feels underdeveloped. Her shapeshifting is well-utilized, but her internal conflict lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The taxi ride and caves transition abruptly. The figurine's role is intriguing but could be better integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and stormy atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the mood. However, the caves' "harmonic" quality feels underused beyond being a backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (figurine, caves), but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "measured wildness"), but some phrasing leans generic ("nagging doubt"). Avoids clich√©s but could push further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The figurine and caves are compelling, but the taxi ride feels like a narrative shortcut.</comment>
