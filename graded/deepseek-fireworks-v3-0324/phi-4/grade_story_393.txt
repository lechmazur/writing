<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the chain-reactive coincidences feel contrived, weakening cause-and-effect logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though some elements (e.g., watchtowers) feel more decorative than integral.</comment>
