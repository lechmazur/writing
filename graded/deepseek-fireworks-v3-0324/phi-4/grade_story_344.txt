<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Elara's initial struggle to her transformative realization. The connection between jam tasting and human connection is unique but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and underwater setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details, like the golden glow and jam aromas, are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (e.g., the glasses as a badge of honor). The theme of healing through connection is compelling, though the ending could be more impactful.</comment>
