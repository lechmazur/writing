<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's quiet deserter persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His introspection and connection to the mirror reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The mirror's role as a catalyst is effective, though the carbonizing action could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plant communication study is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The setting and mirror are meaningfully connected, grounding Eli's journey in a tangible world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, masks) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Theme of renewal is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "noble foolishness" feels underdeveloped. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into flowery prose. Nuanced handling of Eli's transformation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering sense of hope. Creative combination of motifs, though some could be deeper.</comment>
