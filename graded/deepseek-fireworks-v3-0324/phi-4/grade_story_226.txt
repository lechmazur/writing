<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "gloomy" nature feels slightly underdeveloped, relying more on atmosphere than deep introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the black-market method feels underexplored. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the facility and skull creating a haunting, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "craftsman's pride" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The skull's "genuinely artificial" descriptor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The brevity feels deliberate, though a few elements (e.g., black-market) could be more integrated.</comment>
