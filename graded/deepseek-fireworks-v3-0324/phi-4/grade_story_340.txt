<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's pride and feistiness are well-established, but her motivation to "outshine a looming shadow" feels slightly vague. Her connection to the grimoire is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The "youthify" action is inventive, but the "sudden closure of a path" feels underdeveloped as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The treehouse city is evocative but lacks deeper integration with the Amazon setting. Sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (grimoire, paths) and a satisfying ending. The theme of responsibility vs. liberation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in "youthify" and the grimoire's role, but some phrasing leans flowery. Avoids clich√©s but could push further into nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story, but the treehouse city and "clock skipping a beat" feel underutilized. Creative but not flawless cohesion.</comment>
