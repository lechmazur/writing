<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "secret" feels underdeveloped. The gauntlet connection is strong, but his street performer persona lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The adversary's sudden appearance and resolution lack buildup. Pacing suffers slightly in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge is vividly rendered, but the coral reef memory feels disjointed from the setting. Sensory details are otherwise excellent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (gauntlet as peace) is effective, but the emotional payoff is somewhat abrupt. Theme of reconciliation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (reluctant hero, symbolic relic). Some phrasing feels formulaic ("heart lightened," "spirit unblocked").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the coral reef texture feels forced. Length suits the story, though the ending lingers well.</comment>
