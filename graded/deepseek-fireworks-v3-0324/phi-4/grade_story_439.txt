<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mute courier's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his muteness as a defining trait. His actions align with his goal, but his 'voice' remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the comet's guidance feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the portal's formation could be more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The opera house and snowfall create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, but the storm-battered harbor is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are effective, and the theme of exploration is clear. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper emotional resonance. Subtext is present but subtle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (interdimensional travel, comet as guide). Some phrases feel flowery without purpose. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but elements like the comet and opera house feel slightly forced. The length works, but the ending lacks lingering impact.</comment>
