<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and intellect are clear, but her "overqualified" status feels slightly underdeveloped. Her dreamy demeanor and postcard method are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the transition from postcards to chalkboard feels abrupt. The arc is satisfying but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is lush and evocative, with fireflies and autumn leaves enhancing the mood. The tavern setting is vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chalkboard, fireflies) and emotional resonance, though some metaphors verge on predictable. The ending is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (dreamy outsider reinventing tradition). Some phrasing feels overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the word limit strains the integration of all elements. Leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
