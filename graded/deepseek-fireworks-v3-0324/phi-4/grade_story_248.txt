<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but his "unsteady" nature feels underdeveloped. The automaton bird's eerie intelligence adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the "ambush of fate" concept feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and atmospheric, with the docking bay and colliding worlds enhancing tension. Sensory details are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evokes thought and emotion, with strong symbolism (bird, letters). Ending is purposeful, though some themes are stated overtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original but leans on tropes (prophecy, cosmic game). Some phrases feel overly ornate ("cheerless ecstasy").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
