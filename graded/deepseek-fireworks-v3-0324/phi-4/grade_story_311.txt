<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "serene anger" could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed; the lunar greenhouse's role in his rebirth could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is evocatively rendered, but the "park visits" timeframe feels disjointed from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, greenhouse), but the ending's emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("serene anger") verge on clich√©. The lunar setting saves it from being generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the "timely rebirth" concept could be more organically woven into the plot.</comment>
