<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation is clear but his "purposefully aimless" demeanor feels slightly contradictory to his deep quest. His interactions with the fragment and mirrors reveal depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The mirrors and fragment drive the narrative, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse and "sanctified dread" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the cold fragment and mirror reflections enhance the mood effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by its length. Elements serve the narrative, but the brevity limits emotional resonance and thematic exploration.</comment>
