<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aelion's nostalgia and anxiously fearless demeanor are clear, but his motivation feels somewhat generic for an android. The brass telescope adds depth, but his "heart-like core" is a clich√©.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but predictable. The crack in the engine is resolved too neatly, and the "patterns of betrayal" feel underdeveloped despite their potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The levitation facility and breaking dawn create a vivid atmosphere, but the connection between the brass telescope and the setting is tenuous. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story leans too heavily on stated emotions ("relief and pride") rather than showing them. The telescope's symbolism is effective, but the theme of betrayal lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in the android's nostalgia, but phrases like "heart-like core" and "anxiously fearless" feel AI-generated. The "patterns of betrayal" concept is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but lacks depth. The elements serve the plot, but the resolution is too tidy. The length feels constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
