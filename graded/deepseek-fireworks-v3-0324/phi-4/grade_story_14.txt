<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "naive gambler" trait feels underdeveloped beyond surface-level references to chance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc, though the lectures and dock action feel slightly disjointed from the candle mold's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with the tidal station and candlelit dinners merging beautifully to amplify Eli's existential quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (gamblerâ€™s folly, fleeting light). Some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the lectures feel tacked on. Length suits the meditative tone.</comment>
