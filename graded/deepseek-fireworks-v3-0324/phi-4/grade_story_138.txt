<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lord Alistair's motivation is clear, but his nobility feels underutilized. The drone and ticket stubs reveal depth, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The lab's chaos mirrors his turmoil well, but the resolution feels abrupt for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is vivid and enhances the story, but the "hollow recklessness" tone clashes slightly with the introspective theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (drone, stubs) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (fallen noble, technological relic). Some phrases feel overly ornate without payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but don't fully transcend their constraints. The brevity feels limiting, not deliberate.</comment>
