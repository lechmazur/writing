<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "singularly multiple" nature feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her role, but deeper introspection would elevate her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the resolution (internal realization) risks feeling abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (violin) connect meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (violin, puzzle) and subtext, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Ending is purposeful but slightly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases verge on flowery ("graceless beauty"). Avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "thought experiment" timeframe feels underutilized. Leaves a lingering thematic impression.</comment>
