<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. Her distinct voice emerges well in the latter half.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing wobbles in the middle with abrupt supernatural shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the supernatural tension. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the brevity limits deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering thought but could be sharper.</comment>
