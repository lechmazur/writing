<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "normally unusual" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her connection to the telescope is compelling but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the vacation rental interruption feels jarring. The telescope's mystery drives the narrative well, though pacing stumbles briefly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant setting contrasts intriguingly with Elara's mystical pursuits, but sensory details could be sharper. Atmosphere supports her isolation effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (telescope as bridge) and thematic depth, but the ending lacks punch. Literary craft is polished but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "comforting unease" tone wobbles. Avoids clich√©s but some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce decently, but the plant setting feels underutilized. The story lingers intellectually but lacks emotional resonance.</comment>
