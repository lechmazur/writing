<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her philosophical shallowness feels underdeveloped, limiting depth. Her actions align with her mission, but her 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the extraterrestrial setting feels underutilized. The arc is complete, though the vault sequence could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The embassy's alien architecture is hinted at but lacks vivid sensory detail. The atmosphere supports the plot but doesn't fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (amulet, washcloth) and a satisfying ending. The theme of self-discovery is clear, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (ancient spirit, magical amulet). The washcloth is a fresh touch, but some phrasing feels overly formal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the extraterrestrial element feels tacked on. The brevity works, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>
