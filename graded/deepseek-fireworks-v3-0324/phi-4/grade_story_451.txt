<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's motivation is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. The twin separation feels underdeveloped, and the hiring of actors is unique but not fully justified.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The prophecy and baseball connection is compelling, but the transition from farmers market to mountain peak is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid, especially the "crystal shadows" and mountain peak. However, the farmers market setting is underutilized after the opening.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has emotional weight and thematic depth, but some symbolism (e.g., the baseball) feels heavy-handed. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (prophecy, forbidden knowledge). The writing avoids clich√©s but lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by word count. The elements serve the story, but the brevity limits full exploration of ideas.</comment>
