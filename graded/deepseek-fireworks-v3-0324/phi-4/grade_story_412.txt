<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's bookishness and assassin role create an intriguing duality, but her geographic challenge feels underutilized in driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on cyclical nightmares, which risk monotony. The vault resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station's humming machinery and flickering screens evoke strong atmosphere, though the "frequency monitoring" aspect lacks deeper integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some (geographic challenge, station) feel underdeveloped. The ending hints at depth but doesnâ€™t fully deliver.</comment>
