<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliana's motivation is clear but her "blatantly secretive" nature feels underdeveloped. The dried flower and book add depth, but her actions sometimes lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The discovery of the book and kiss moment work, but the transition to collaboration with Alex feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary's atmosphere is vivid and immersive, though the connection to lost technologies is tenuous. Sensory details (birds, library) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (flower, doodles) and a memorable tone, but the emotional payoff of the kiss moment is undercut by hurried resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the doodles-as-map concept, but some phrasing feels formulaic ("air crackled with potential"). The tone wobbles between edgy and sentimental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story strains under their weight. The length feels limiting, not deliberate. Leaves a lingering question but lacks polish.</comment>
