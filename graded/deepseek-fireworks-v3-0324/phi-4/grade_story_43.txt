<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's introversion and motivation are clear, but "loudly introverted" feels slightly contradictory without deeper exploration. His connection to the CD is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the firefly method feels underutilized. The CD's role in the climax ties the arc together neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and fog create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon hum, damp earth) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (CD, fireflies) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of courage could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original setting and fresh metaphors (e.g., "crooked hope"), but some phrases verge on flowery. Avoids clich√©s but could lean further into subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the fireflies' role could be sharper.</comment>
