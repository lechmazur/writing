<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The statue's telepathy and tragically joyful demeanor create a compelling, distinct character. Motivation to find truth is clear but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the festival's resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steam-powered setting and gloomy cheerfulness are vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (frayed cloak, humming gears) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hair tie, ink-like thoughts) and emotional resonance. Ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though the "truth vs. lies" theme is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of melancholy hope.</comment>
