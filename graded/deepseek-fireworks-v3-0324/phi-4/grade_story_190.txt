<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "meticulously impulsive" nature feels slightly contrived. His distinct voice and actions align well with his smuggling background and empathy quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts (musical memories, empathy) without enough concrete cause-and-effect. Pacing is uneven due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center is underutilized; the atmosphere is evocative but lacks grounding sensory details. The butterfly's connection to the setting is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butterfly, musical memories) and subtext about empathy. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise but occasionally slips into flowery prose. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the "enthusiastic apathy" tone feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering thought about empathy, though cohesion suffers slightly.</comment>
