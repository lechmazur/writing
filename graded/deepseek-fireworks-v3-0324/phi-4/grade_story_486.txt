<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "clumsily dexterous" attribute feels underdeveloped. His silent retribution is compelling but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The pantomime method is unconventional but logically executed. The word limit is handled deftly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and stained glass fragment create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard") are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, imagery) are used effectively, and the ending is satisfying. However, the theme of silence vs. noise could be explored with more depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into tropes (e.g., the "magic artisan" archetype). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, though some themes could be expanded.</comment>
