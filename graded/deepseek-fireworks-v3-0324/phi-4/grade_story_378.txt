<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mayor's grumpy yet reluctant transformation is compelling, but his motivation to "change the course of fate" feels slightly abstract for his established demeanor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the beetle's metamorphosis serving as a strong pivot, though the monks' exposition could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The swamp orchard's decay and renewal are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The monks' presence slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (beetle, water wisdom) is effective, and the ending resonates. Some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (reclusive monks, transformative artifact). The grumpy-to-awed arc lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the carnival's role feels underutilized. The length suits the story's ambition.</comment>
