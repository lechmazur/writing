<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the dice roll as a plot device is clever but could be more consequential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the space pirate element feels tangential. The brevity works in its favor, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
