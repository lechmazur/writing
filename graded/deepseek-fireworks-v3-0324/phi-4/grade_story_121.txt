<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; the "shifty caretaker" trait feels underdeveloped, though his spontaneous nature aligns with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphorical progression; the connection between the parole hearing and the caravans is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in theater is evocatively rendered, but the timeframe ("hush of a parole hearing") feels disconnected from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract nature of the conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing; the microscope metaphor is fresh, but the caravans verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The elements cohere thematically, but the story feels constrained by its brevity, leaving some arcs unresolved.</comment>
