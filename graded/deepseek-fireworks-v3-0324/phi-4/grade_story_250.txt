<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "blunt heretic" trait feels underdeveloped. The teddy bear adds depth, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The stock ticker method feels contrived, and the resolution lacks weight due to brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly atmospheric, but the "hush" timeframe is underutilized. Sensory details are strong but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (teddy bear, promises) works well, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (omniscient mind, library quest). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("anxious elation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but serviceable. The length feels limiting, not deliberate. Creativity is evident but not groundbreaking.</comment>
