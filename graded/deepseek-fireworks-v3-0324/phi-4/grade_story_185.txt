<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with a clear, consistent motivation tied to his obsession with buried talents. His calm demeanor and connection to the pencil stub reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly abstract. The connection between the pencil stub and piano bench decoding is intriguing but underdeveloped. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are richly evocative, with sensory details like the "humming" air enhancing immersion. The probability mapping center and millennia-spanning timeframe merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pencil stub as a key) and subtext (combating entropy). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but some phrases verge on flowery ("fractured grace"). Avoids clich√©s, but the piano bench method feels slightly forced. Nuanced emotion is present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering thought about forgotten potential, though the brevity slightly limits thematic depth.</comment>
