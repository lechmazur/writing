<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her femme fatale archetype feels slightly underdeveloped. The amber earrings effectively symbolize her past, but her "restlessly curious" attribute could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between time travel and the sky reflection pool is intriguing but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with the sky reflection pool serving as a powerful metaphor. Sensory details are well-deployed, though the time travel era could be more vividly realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, but the theme of "gravity of desires" occasionally feels overstated. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The handling of emotion is nuanced, but the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. It leaves a lingering impression, though the tight word limit slightly constrains its depth.</comment>
