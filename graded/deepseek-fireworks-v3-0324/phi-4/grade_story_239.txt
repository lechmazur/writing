<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "frenetic" nature feels underdeveloped. The lunchbox adds a touch of authenticity, but her defiance lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies heavily on the power outage as a contrivance. The connection between the tree ring room and the town square feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with strong sensory elements (aged wood, lanterns). The "ancient echoes" motif enhances the setting but isn't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of illusions as symbolism, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by predictable resolutions. The theme of connection is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (magic as unity, the "light in darkness" motif). Some phrases ("radiant shifts") feel overused, though the lunchbox adds uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans on familiar beats. The length feels deliberate, but the ending lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
