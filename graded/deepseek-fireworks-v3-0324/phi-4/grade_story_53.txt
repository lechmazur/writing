<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's rashness and protective nature are clear, but her motivation to find solace in the cosmos feels slightly abstract. Her reaction to the postcards reveals depth, though her impulsiveness could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between the postcards and Elara's journey is strong, though the "moving day" element is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fortress and caverns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, and the wind's shifting tone enhances the mood. Sensory details are evocative, though the "howling caverns" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (postcards as keys) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some themes (e.g., "universally unique") could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The writing avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases ("whispering secrets") verge on overused. Emotional nuance is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative well. The length works, but the "moving day" timeframe feels incidental. Leaves a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
