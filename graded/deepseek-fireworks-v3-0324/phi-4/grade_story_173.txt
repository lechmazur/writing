<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her trustworthy, unique nature. Her interaction with the phantom hand reveals depth, though her "wandering orchardist" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the phantom hand's role feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the multiverse concept could be more tightly woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater city hall and multiverse setting are evocatively rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances Elara's mission, though the kitchen table's connection to the setting is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are effective, and the story prompts reflection. The ending is purposeful, but the phantom hand's guidance could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, though the "bittersweet grit" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
