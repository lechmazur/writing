<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear but his "rationally subjective" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his redemption arc, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the museum meetings feel contrived. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "static electricity garden" is evocative, but its connection to the crate slat is weak. Atmosphere supports the tone well, but sensory details could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is present but relies on stated feelings. The ending is satisfying, though subtext is minimal. Literary devices are used competently.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (redemption arc). Some phrases feel formulaic, and emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The ending lingers, but the premise lacks deeper exploration.</comment>
