<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's vigilance and motivation are clear, but her orchardist background feels underutilized. Her sardonic glee and resilience are well-developed, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The peacock tail method feels abrupt, though the conspiracy tie to her past is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility is unique but underdeveloped. Sardonic glee contrasts well with the tragedy, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors (peacock tail) feel forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original but uneven. The orchardist/seal combo is fresh, but the peacock tail decoding leans toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite odd elements. The brevity works, but some components (orchardist, peacock) feel tacked on.</comment>
