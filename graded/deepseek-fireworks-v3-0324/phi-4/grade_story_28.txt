<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "sly agent" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the "last puzzle piece" moment lacks buildup, and the family tradition method feels abruptly inserted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with strong sensory details, though the "oddly usual" contrast isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and emotional resonance, but the theme of preservation is somewhat heavy-handed in its delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on familiar tropes (abandoned carnival, relic-hunting agent). Some phrasing feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the story feels constrained by its word limit, sacrificing depth for brevity.</comment>
