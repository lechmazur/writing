<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "ruthlessness" feels underdeveloped; the comb adds intrigue but her actions lack consistent edge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the road trip conversations feel abrupt, and the resolution leans too heavily on exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stone circle and singerâ€™s pause create strong atmosphere, though sensory details could be sharper. The setting elevates the mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (flowers, comb) works well, but emotional resonance is muted. Ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "decoding secrets" trope. Some phrases feel AI-polished rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The comb and stone circle are highlights.</comment>
