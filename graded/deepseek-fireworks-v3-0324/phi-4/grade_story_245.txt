<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and his actions align with his smuggling past, but his "irate" nature feels underdeveloped. The chopstick as a symbol works well, but his emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract symbolism (tea leaves, waterfalls) without enough concrete progression. Pacing is decent, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is evocative, and the tone complements Jax's quest. Sensory details (cold metal, distant waterfalls) are strong, but the setting's connection to the chopstick is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) is overused without enough payoff. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional weight. The theme of redemption is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (smuggler seeking redemption). The prose avoids clich√©s but leans too abstract. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but feel forced (tea leaves in a spaceport). The length suits the story, but the execution lacks the depth to linger.</comment>
