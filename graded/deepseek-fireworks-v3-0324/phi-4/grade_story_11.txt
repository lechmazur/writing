<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "flighty" nature isn't fully explored. The grease-stained patch adds depth, but her cartographer background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method of linearizing paintings drives the story effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The initiation hall setting is evocative but lacks deeper sensory immersion. The dim lighting and rituals create atmosphere, but more vivid details would enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the patch, flicker of unity) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the "serene anger" tone could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (secret society, legacy-seeking). The "flicker of unity" motif is fresh, but some phrasing feels repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>
