<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raider's motivation is clear and unique, but his "hesitant" and "stubbornly open-minded" traits could be more deeply integrated into his actions and voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the talent show device feels slightly contrived for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The speakeasy setting is evocative but underutilized; midnight's "hush" contrasts oddly with the "restless trust" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth, though some symbolism (e.g., the mug) is overly explicit. The ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise, but the prose occasionally leans into predictable phrasing ("weight of his past lifting"). Nuanced emotion saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story cohesively, but the talent show and speakeasy clash tonally. The brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
