<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alex's transition from game show host to castaway is compelling, but his motivation to "rescue sacred knowledge" feels slightly forced. His connection to the crystal ball is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The illness and stranger's introduction feel organic, but the crystal ball's role in the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The island's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "insect symphony hall" and "bitter honey" tone enrich the setting, though the latter could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the crystal ball as a metaphor for perception). The ending is satisfying, but some themes are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (castaway redemption). The "gentle overturn" concept is fresh, but execution occasionally feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts (e.g., "sacred knowledge") could be deeper.</comment>
