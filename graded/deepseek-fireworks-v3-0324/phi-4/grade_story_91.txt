<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and poetic, but the "escaped lab experiment" aspect feels underdeveloped, relying more on implied mystery than depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the method of "quiet tuning" via cloud shadows leans heavily on abstraction, risking vagueness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s brevity limits deeper exploration. The quiet revolution theme lingers, though execution leans on abstraction.</comment>
