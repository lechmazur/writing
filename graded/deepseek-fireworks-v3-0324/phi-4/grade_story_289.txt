<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "brainy observer" trait feels somewhat superficial, lacking deeper introspection or unique voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the ephemeral street art method feels underdeveloped as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered, but its connection to the doll and street art could be more organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
