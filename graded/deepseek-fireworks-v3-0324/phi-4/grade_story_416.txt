<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cedric's academically rebellious nature is somewhat underdeveloped, but his motivation to collect urban legends is clear. The connection with the stranger feels abrupt but intriguing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The fossilized shell's discovery resolves too neatly, though the pacing manages the word limit well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The luminous swamp is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details like the iridescent shell elevate immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tight word count. The endingâ€™s reflection on "new beginnings" lingers, though the championship match feels tangential.</comment>
