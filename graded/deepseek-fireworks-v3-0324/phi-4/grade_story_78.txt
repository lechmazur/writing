<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "softly militant" attribute feels underdeveloped. His late-blooming heroism is compelling but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The spyglass as a symbol of hope drives the narrative effectively, though the coercion element feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and post-apocalyptic setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but purposeful, grounding the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spyglass, farm) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original but leans on familiar tropes (apocalyptic heroism). Some phrasing feels slightly generic, though the voice avoids outright clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though the theme could be more layered.</comment>
