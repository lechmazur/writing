<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliot's transformation from underachieving to confident is clear, but his "exceptionally usual" trait feels underdeveloped. Motivation is consistent but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the space station setting feels disconnected from the farmland resolution. Pacing is effective but hinges on contrivances (misdelivered package).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent—space station and farmland clash tonally. Sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (doll head, heritage) is promising but surface-level. Ending is satisfying but lacks subtext. Writing style is functional but not distinctive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but leans on predictable tropes (hidden chamber, underdog arc). Emotional beats are stated rather than shown. Originality is middling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements feel forced together (space station + farmland). Story serves the elements, not vice versa. Brief length works, but cohesion suffers.</comment>
