<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "analytically free" attribute is intriguing but not deeply explored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the final bow and the repair bay feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the repair bay's transformation into wilderness slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the theme of "wilderness wisdom" feels underdeveloped despite evocative prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by vague concepts like "defying finality" and occasional over-formal phrasing. Some metaphors feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story leans on abstraction. The length feels deliberate, though some ideas lack grounding.</comment>
