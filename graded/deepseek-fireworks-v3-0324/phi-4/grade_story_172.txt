<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guide's accidental heroism and motivation to outrun the prophecy are clear, but his "sharp gentleness" could be more vividly demonstrated through actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from the hallway photo to the beach revelation. The puzzle box's alignment drives the story effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seashell and beach setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, though the hallway's connection feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (puzzle box, seashell) and a satisfying ending, but the "reversed wishes" method lacks depth in execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (prophecy, puzzle box). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity works, though the "reversed wishes" and "sharp gentleness" feel less integrated.</comment>
