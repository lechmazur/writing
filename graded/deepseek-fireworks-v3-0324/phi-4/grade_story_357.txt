<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the invitation driving the narrative forward. The connection between solitude and triumph over despair is clear, though the board game metaphor feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The black rose and setting work symbiotically to reinforce Elara's character and the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (black rose, board game) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the "earnest flippancy" tone could be more consistently woven into the prose.</comment>
