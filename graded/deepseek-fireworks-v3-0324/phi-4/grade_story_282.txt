<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Finn's wild demeanor and passion for traditional games are clear, but his motivation feels slightly abstract. The war medal adds depth but isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Finn's action, but the explosion's purpose (drawing attention to games) feels underdeveloped. Pacing is solid within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the chamber's atmosphere enhances the story's whimsical tone. The discount store contrast works well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., dust as symbolism) are effective, and the ending is satisfying. However, the theme of reciprocity isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and a unique premise. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative. The length suits the tale, though the explosion's impact could be sharper.</comment>
