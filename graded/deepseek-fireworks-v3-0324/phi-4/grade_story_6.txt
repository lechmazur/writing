<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eamon's skepticism and minstrel background are clear but could be deeper. His motivation to out-scheme the trickster is consistent but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The slingshot action and steam vent method drive the story logically, though the trickster's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The factory setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The disappearing ink concept adds intrigue, though its connection to the dragon-scale armor could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of imagery and symbolism, with a satisfying ending. The theme of outwitting chaos is clear, but deeper subtext or emotional resonance could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (immortal trickster, relic hunt). The tone shifts slightly between awe and skepticism, though the prose avoids being overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with a sense of adventure, though a stronger thematic punch would make it unforgettable.</comment>
