<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his "confusingly lucid" attribute feels underdeveloped. His poetic response to the dummy is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration of his pickpocket background.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surrealism without grounding transitions. The poetry-as-transformation device is inventive but risks feeling abrupt in such a short format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—haunting sensory details (e.g., "glassy eyes," "cold, damp walls") immerse the reader, though the lighthouse setting could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and thematic depth elevate the prose, but the ending's epiphany ("true transformation was within himself") verges on cliché. Subtext about identity is compelling but slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (haunted dummy, poetic catharsis). Some phrases ("scorching poise," "surreal wonder") feel overwrought, diluting authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the poetry method and "between appointments" timeframe feel contrived. The story's brevity works, though some themes beg expansion.</comment>
