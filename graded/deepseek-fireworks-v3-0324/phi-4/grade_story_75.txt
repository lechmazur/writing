<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elyan's contradictions and motivations are well-explored, but his "skeptically credulous" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between "grassroots movements" and Elyan's personal journey feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nano-forest is evocatively rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere, though the "angry peace" tone could be more deeply woven into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, vows) and emotional resonance, but the theme of "grassroots movements" lacks integration with Elyan's personal transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic voice, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The handling of "decrypting wedding vows" feels fresh, but "nano-forest" risks gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative element integration. The brevity works, but the "grassroots" concept feels tacked on rather than essential.</comment>
