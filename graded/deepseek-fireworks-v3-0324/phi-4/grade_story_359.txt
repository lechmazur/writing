<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's absent-mindedness and ironic hope are clear but could be deeper. Clara's detachment is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels rushed. The lion knocker and train station encounter are abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nature sound archive is evocative, but AI-era setting feels underutilized. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (lion, brew) works well, but emotional impact is muted. Theme of compassion is clear but not profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original but leans on tropes (dream salvage, chance encounters). Some phrasing feels AI-polished rather than human-raw.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but elements like AI-era and intimate detachment feel tacked on. Length suits the arc.</comment>
