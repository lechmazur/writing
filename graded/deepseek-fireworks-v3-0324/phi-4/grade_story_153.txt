<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "eternal" nature feels underdeveloped. His obsession with immortality and reality mastery is compelling but could benefit from deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the digitization process feels rushed. The connection between journals and Eli's revelation is strong, though pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground city and headlamp's glow create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's thematic depth and symbolism (light/darkness, burdens/gifts) are strengths. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (immortality quest, underground dystopia). Emotional resonance is present but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though some concepts (e.g., "gifted burdens") could be more fully explored.</comment>
