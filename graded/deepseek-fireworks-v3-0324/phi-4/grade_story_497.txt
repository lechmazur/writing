<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's daydreaming nature and obsession with the past are well-integrated, but his motivation to inspire generations feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution, though the satellite fragment's role could be more tightly woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submerged palace and cursed lake create a haunting, evocative atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like the lapping waters and echoes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (scuff marks as language, satellite as key) is strong, but the emotional resonance of "threads of compassion" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans slightly on tropes (lost civilizations, scholar's obsession). Some metaphors ("pristine chaos") feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the satellite's significance feels underdeveloped compared to the skating rink's lore.</comment>
