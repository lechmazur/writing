<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; "mischievous wisdom" is underdeveloped. The battered plastic tray feels forced as a companion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear cause-and-effect logic; the candle wick method is unconvincing as a driver. Pacing is uneven, with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described but underutilized. The "leaf raking" timeframe adds little. Sensory details are strong but sporadic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some effective imagery, but themes feel overstated. Ending is tidy but lacks depth. Conflict is vague, relying on atmosphere over substance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©d phrases ("seeds of a better tomorrow"). Emotional resonance is stated, not shown. Tone shifts awkwardly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel cobbled together rather than cohesive. The candle wick method and plastic tray drag down the narrative's plausibility.</comment>
