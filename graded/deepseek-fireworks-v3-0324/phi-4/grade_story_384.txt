<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her role as a cook feels underutilized; her curiosity drives the plot, but her profession doesn't meaningfully intersect with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the eraser and walking stick feels contrived. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details, but the earthquake prediction facility setting feels disconnected from the core mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively and has a satisfying ending, but the theme of "exposing illusions" could be more deeply explored. The writing style enhances the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel overly polished. The emotional resonance is genuine, though nuanced character reactions could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but some elements (like the facility) don't fully integrate. The length works, and the ending leaves a lingering thought.</comment>
