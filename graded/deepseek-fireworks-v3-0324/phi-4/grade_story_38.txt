<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear but their actions feel somewhat disjointed from their insomniac trait. The drunken confessions add depth but aren't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the transition from attic to subway feels abrupt. The concept of whispers as warnings is underdeveloped in driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic and botanical samples create a rich atmosphere, but "empty abundance" as a tone is inconsistently conveyed. Sensory details are strong but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the theme of non-violence feels slightly forced. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (haunted attic, drunken confessions). Some phrases feel overly flowery without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but elements like "empty abundance" and "between subway stops" feel underutilized. The length suits the narrative, but depth is lacking.</comment>
