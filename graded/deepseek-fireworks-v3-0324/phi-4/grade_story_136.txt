<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "silently talkative" nature feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her role, but the paradox isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The VR headset and logbook drive the narrative effectively, though the "jeopardize" element feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The root system mapping facility is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's themes. Sensory details are sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of rebirth could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (e.g., cryptic ancient texts). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative. The length works, but the ending lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
