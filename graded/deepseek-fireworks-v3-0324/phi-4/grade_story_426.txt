<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "secretive pathfinder" trait feels underdeveloped. The cracked teapot and folk medicine preservation add depth, though his "aloof passion" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the marathon training feels tangential. The ghost train and hug are strong moments, though the playlist method disrupts pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, with eerie atmosphere and sensory details. The ghost train and teapot are meaningfully connected, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (teapot, playlists) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but the "forgotten prodigy" theme could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but leans on tropes (haunted settings, lost legacies). The "angrily peaceful" duality is fresh, but some phrases feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. The marathon training feels forced, but the ghostly encounter and teapot symbolism elevate the story.</comment>
