<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "strangely trustworthy" attribute feels underexplored. His actions align well with his outcast status and quest for truth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The diaries and seashell ritual logically drive the narrative, though the tile discovery feels slightly convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch's garage and half-lit corridor create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (pulsing seashell, dusty tomes) enhance immersion, though the "flying carpet" aspect is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seashell, midnight) and subtext about fleeting truths. The ending is purposeful, but the "frantic peace" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (soul-mirroring seashell), though some phrasing leans flowery. Avoids clich√©s but the scholar's "trustworthy" trait lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's theme of transience. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection, but the garage setting could be more integral.</comment>
