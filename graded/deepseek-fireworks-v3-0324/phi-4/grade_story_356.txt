<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's wry caretaker role and her motivation to silence her "what if" thoughts are clear and consistent, but her sudden vanishing feels slightly abrupt for her established character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the vanishing action, while poetic, lacks sufficient buildup to feel fully earned within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chalk lines as time) and a resonant theme, though the ending’s emotional impact is slightly diluted by the abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "what if siren song"), though the space pirate setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the word limit slightly strains the integration of all elements, particularly the ship’s role.</comment>
