<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The "obsessive calm" is well-portrayed, but deeper introspection could strengthen her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on cryptic guidance. The pacing is tight, though the resolution atop the tower feels abrupt for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cloud city is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's ethereal tension. Sensory details (e.g., "whispering winds") are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (metal washer, sacred symbols) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The "robustly delicate" metaphor is fresh, and the tone avoids purple prose. Some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story occasionally feels constrained by them. The brevity works, though more thematic depth would elevate it.</comment>
