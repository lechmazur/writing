<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's subdued vigilante nature and artfully clumsy demeanor are well-integrated, but his motivation to master an ancient art feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, but deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eli's method, though the connection between virtual calls and the mirror feels tenuous. Pacing is effective, but the resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and screaming silence create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, light, bead's glow) are evocative and enhance the mood, though the mirror's distortions could be more vividly described.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the theme of war's cost is poignant. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict could be more pronounced. Subtext enriches the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the "screaming silence" motif feels slightly overused. Avoids clich√©s but could take bolder risks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though a tighter focus on the mirror's revelations would elevate it further.</comment>
