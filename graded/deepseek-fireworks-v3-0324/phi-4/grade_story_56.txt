<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliot's swindler background and sudden pull toward honesty create intriguing tension, but Clara's introduction feels slightly rushed, diluting her impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on serendipity (computer restart, dropped book), which weakens cause-and-effect logic. The arc is clear but leans heavily on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with evocative contrasts (orchard vs. skyscraper), though the "invisible allies" concept slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (price tag, computer) is strong, but the emotional payoff lacks depth. The ending feels hopeful yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on tropes (meet-cute, spirits guiding humans). Some phrases ("energetically lethargic") feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the storyâ€™s brevity limits thematic exploration. The style is polished but risks being overly whimsical.</comment>
