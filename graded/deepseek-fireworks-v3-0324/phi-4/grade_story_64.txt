<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear but their "technically wild" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their actions align with their goal, but their personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The coded scuffs as a method work, but the judge's verdict feels tangential to the main conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story. Sensory details are strong, though the "hush" before the verdict slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of immortality's cost is compelling. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The alchemist's reasoning lacks human nuance, and the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative well. The length is deliberate, but the judge's verdict feels like an unnecessary addition.</comment>
