<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "gleefully morose" demeanor feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places, particularly the transition from gathering ingredients to brewing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "crisp nostalgia" tone occasionally clashes with the facility's decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (dying realm, forgotten secrets). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly.</comment>
