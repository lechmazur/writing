<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thorne's jovial yet reluctant nature is clear, but his shift from mercenary to seeker of intangible treasure feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The telescope and vow drive the narrative effectively, though the garden's transformation could be better integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch's herb garden is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the mystical atmosphere. The setting supports the story's tone but slightly overshadows the telescope's role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (telescope as legacy). The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors feel slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (sellsword with a heart, magical garden). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be more distinctive in voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, though some themes (doubt, legacy) could be more sharply explored.</comment>
