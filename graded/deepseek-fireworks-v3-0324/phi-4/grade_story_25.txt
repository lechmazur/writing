<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mariner's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his "coldly intense" attribute is underutilized in shaping deeper personality nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed in connecting the ladder, diary, and forest; the theater framing is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit, leaving key threads unresolved or underexplored.</comment>
