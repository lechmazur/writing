<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'fervent apathy' feels slightly contradictory. The hatpin as a talisman is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the marble-swirl method feels abrupt. The ending resolves neatly, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is vivid and immersive, but the storm's aftermath isn't fully exploited for atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original blend of elements, but "fervent apathy" and some descriptors feel slightly forced or AI-like.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the cyberpunk setting slightly overshadows the character's arc.</comment>
