<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's lovelorn spy persona is intriguing but underdeveloped; his indifference feels inconsistent with his vulnerability. Mia's role is functional but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the avalanche threat escalates abruptly. The sticky label and recipe elements feel tangential to the core conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Neon-lit slums and hovercrafts create vivid atmosphere, though "futuristic" details are sparse. Sensory immersion is strong but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery (e.g., "dying stars"), but emotional beats are told rather than shown. The ending's hopeful tone clashes with earlier tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original premise marred by clich√©s ("fortress of secrets," "determined glint"). Gloating moment stands out, but other tropes feel algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are forced together (recipe, avalanche). Word limit strains cohesion, though the slums setting is well-utilized.</comment>
