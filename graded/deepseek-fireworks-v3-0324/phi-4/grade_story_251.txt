<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's ambivalence and happily sad demeanor are well-integrated, but his motivation to scramble the cosmic scoreboard feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between jigsaw puzzles and cosmic defragmentation leans on poetic abstraction rather than logical cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is evocative, and the atmosphere of quiet cosmic mystery enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe "between heartbeats" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by the protagonist's detached demeanor. The ending is satisfying but lacks visceral resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "bashful arrogance" tone occasionally clashes with the story's meditative pace. The marbles and puzzles are fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the lunar setting feels secondary to the philosophical core. The story lingers intellectually but not emotionally.</comment>
