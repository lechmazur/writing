<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The grandmaster's chess background and curiosity are well-integrated, but his motivation for seeking hidden passages feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the transition from chess logic to farm mystery feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hydroponic farm setting is vivid and atmospheric, though its connection to the grandmaster's quest could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (puzzle piece, confetti) and mood, but the theme of "pulse of mystery" is somewhat overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into flowery prose ("agonizing bliss," "xenophobic to distractions"). Some AI-like phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels like it strains to fit them all. Ends with a satisfying hint of depth.</comment>
