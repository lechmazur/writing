<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'subtle swordsman' trait feels underutilized in action. His introspection adds depth, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The schematic's urgency could be sharper, but the forest's guidance ties it together.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The petrified forest is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the mood. The setting feels alive and integral to the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's wisdom theme leans slightly didactic. The prose is evocative but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrases verge on clich√© ("whispered secrets"). The emotional resonance is genuine but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering philosophical question, though the schematic's stakes feel underexplored.</comment>
