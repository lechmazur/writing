<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "formally casual" attribute feels underdeveloped. His thin-lipped descriptor adds minor texture but doesn't deeply shape his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ritual's obscurity slightly weakens cause-and-effect logic, but the tight word limit is managed effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The mine setting feels underutilized, but the tone complements the concept well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (figurehead, calendar) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the "confusing certainty" tone occasionally muddles emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable arcane tropes, but the combination of elements feels fresh. Some phrasing leans flowery without depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the mine/library connection could be sharper.</comment>
