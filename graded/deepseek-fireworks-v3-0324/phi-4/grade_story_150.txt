<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eliot's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vivid and distinct, but his "virtually peculiar" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation to spark curiosity is clear, though his reactions could delve deeper into his outlaw nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the tight word limit rushes the resolution. The dice and shifting walls drive the story well, though the climax could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The coffee shop's shifting walls and gear-clinking atmosphere enhance the story's mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (dice, walls) are effective, and the theme of destiny is layered. The ending is satisfying, but the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cowboy poet and runic dice are inventive, though "saturated ambivalence" feels slightly forced. The prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about destiny. A few tighter integrations would elevate it further.</comment>
