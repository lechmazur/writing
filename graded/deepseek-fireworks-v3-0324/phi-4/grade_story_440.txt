<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear but his "lovingly detached" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his vow, but his personality lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The connection between the vow and the pottery feels abrupt. Pacing suffers due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center is vividly rendered, but the sea pottery's connection to the setting could be stronger. Atmosphere supports the tone well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of "secret weavers," but some phrasing feels formulaic. Emotional resonance is subtle but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its length. The style is purposeful but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
