<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's conscientious objector background and scientific curiosity are well-integrated, but his "coy malevolence" feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his otherwise warm demeanor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the neighborhood watch subplot feels tangential. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the storms could be more deeply woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rusty nail, migration maps) and evocative prose, but the "coy malevolence" tone clashes with the otherwise reflective theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing. The "valiantly bored" attribute feels forced, and the malevolence lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though some elements (neighborhood watch, craft fairs) feel underutilized. Leaves a lingering impression of quiet determination.</comment>
