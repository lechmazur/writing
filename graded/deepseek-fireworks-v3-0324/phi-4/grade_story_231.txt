<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eshmun's sentimental and spontaneous nature is clear, but his motivation to "welcome chaos as a teacher" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, but deeper nuance could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The coordinates and scales of justice drive the narrative effectively, though the transition to the hidden chamber could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Sumerian setting is vividly evoked, and the atmosphere enhances the story's themes. Sensory details like the glint of the hairpin and the palace's grandeur immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (hairpin, scales) effectively and leaves a thoughtful impression. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional depth could be shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but occasional phrases ("chaotic humility") feel slightly forced. The handling of emotion is nuanced but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering thought about justice and chaos, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
