<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fighter's paradoxical nature ("skillfully incompetent") is intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear but somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed in its resolution. The connection between abduction and self-deception is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic and clockwork animals create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ticking, aged wood) are expertly used to enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (owl, shard) and subtext. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally. Writing style is polished but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (epiphany in an attic). Some phrases feel overly poetic without purpose. Emotional resonance is genuine but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, though the brevity limits depth. The story feels deliberate but slightly constrained by its word count.</comment>
