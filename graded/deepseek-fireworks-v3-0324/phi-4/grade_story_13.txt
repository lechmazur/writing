<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration; his solemnity is consistent but could benefit from more nuanced reactions to the garden's revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the transition from poems to garden discovery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the laboratory's connection to the garden could be more thematically intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance is somewhat muted by the brevity of Eamon's transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, though the "mild fervor" tone occasionally clashes with the solemnity of the swordsman.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but the ending's thematic weight could be sharper to linger more powerfully with the reader.</comment>
