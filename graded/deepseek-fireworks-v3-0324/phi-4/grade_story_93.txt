<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The architect's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his personality. His actions align with his quest, but his "voice" feels somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between the elevator farewell and the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (radio static, card edges) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cards, geometry) and thematic depth, but the emotional impact is occasionally undermined by telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (labyrinth, hidden knowledge). Some phrases feel overly ornate without adding substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story’s brevity limits thematic resonance. The ending hints at depth but doesn’t fully deliver.</comment>
