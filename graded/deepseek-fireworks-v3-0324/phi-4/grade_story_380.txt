<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is intriguing but somewhat vague; his "quiet mania" and dream-thieving past are compelling but underdeveloped. His mathematical challenges feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the connection between Eli's past and present feels tenuous. Pacing is strong, though the sport motif abruptly surfaces and fades.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The treehouse library is vividly rendered, but the post-human timeframe is underutilized. Atmosphere excels with sensory details (creaking floorboards, yellowed pages).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (thunder, fragmented self) is potent but occasionally heavy-handed. The ending resonates, though the sport subplot dilutes thematic focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in Eli's concept, but execution leans on clich√©s (lonely outcast, forgotten past). Some phrases feel AI-polished rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the sport and math attributes distract. The length feels deliberate, though the climax lacks punch.</comment>
