<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliot's phobias and stunt double background are intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" feels poetic but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphor. The net unraveling as a parallel to facing fears is clear, though the garage sales timeframe feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library and pyramid setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the "echoes in the dark" concept isn't fully integrated into the sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional payoff is muted by the numb tone. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (labyrinth as metaphor, "facing fears"). Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the garage sales and stunt double details feel superfluous. The brevity works, though the theme is somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>
