<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alex's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. The fishing lure as a key to his trauma is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent, but the raindrop method feels underdeveloped. The loop's repetition is effective, though the resolution is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the bell's echo and raindrop are immersive, but the "excited boredom" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lure, raindrop) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but the prose occasionally slips into flowery clich√©s. The trauma theme is nuanced but could avoid some AI-like logical leaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the quantum tunnel's logic could be tighter.</comment>
