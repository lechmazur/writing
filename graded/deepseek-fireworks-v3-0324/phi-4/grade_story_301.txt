<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; the gloves and codes add depth, but his "ethically questionable" nature feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action; the knitting motif is unique but slows momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jazz age setting is vivid and immersive, though the "time capsule" aspect feels underutilized. Sensory details (gloves, mug, saxophone) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, codes) is effective, but the theme of "breaking expectations" lacks tension. Ending is poetic but unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally verbose; metaphors (gloves as metaphor) are fresh, though some phrasing leans flowery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels more atmospheric than driven. Length suits the meditative tone, but thematic depth is uneven.</comment>
