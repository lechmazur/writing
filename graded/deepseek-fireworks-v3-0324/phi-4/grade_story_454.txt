<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but his "reckless smuggler" trait feels underutilized. The clover and his emotional paradox are well-integrated, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the watch alarm method feels contrived. The arc is complete, though pacing suffers slightly from abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted funhouse setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the tone. Sensory details are strong, but the "map tear" concept is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (clover, alarms) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middling—the "jubilant despair" tone feels forced, and some phrases verge on cliché. Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story leans too heavily on assigned prompts. The length feels deliberate, though creativity is uneven.</comment>
