<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear but his "factually imaginative" attribute feels underdeveloped. The handkerchief adds depth, but his actions lack deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the hopscotch board method feels contrived. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the archive setting isn't fully utilized. The pine scent and mournful elation tone stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (handkerchief, seeds) and lyrical prose, but the theme of preservation lacks deeper exploration. Ending is poignant but slight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on wistful tropes. Some phrases ("mournful elation") feel overused. Emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the hopscotch board feels forced. The length suits the story, though it lacks lasting impact.</comment>
