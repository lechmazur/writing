<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "bitterly optimistic" outlook is consistent, but her backstory feels underexplored for such a high-concept premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but leans heavily on contrivance (e.g., the detour leading to revelation). Pacing is rushed in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The xenobiology setting and cloud migration create a vivid atmosphere, though the station's integration with nature could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (parking stub, clouds) is effective, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. Ending feels neat but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (lost heiress, fragmented reality). Some phrases verge on purple prose ("reckless precision").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels like a sketch for a longer work. The detour method weakens momentum.</comment>
