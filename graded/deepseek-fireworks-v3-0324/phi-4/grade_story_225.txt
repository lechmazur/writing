<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and poetic, though her "unjustly fair" heart could be more deeply explored. Thorne feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract symbolism; the Morse code device feels underexplored as a driving action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine and "battered marvel" tone are vividly rendered, though the "broken treaties" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "dry highlighter pen" risks gimmickry. Avoids AI tropes but could push further into subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette with lingering impact, though some elements feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>
