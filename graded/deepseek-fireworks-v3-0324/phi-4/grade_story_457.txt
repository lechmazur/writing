<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'urban hermit' trait feels slightly underdeveloped. The broken zipper pull effectively reveals his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between folklore analysis and Eli's liberation could be tighter. The ending resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck and urban setting create a vivid contrast. Sensory details (cold metal, swirling galaxies) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (zipper pull, stars) and subtext. The theme of storytelling as liberation is compelling, though the ending leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("skyscrapers like needles"). Avoids clich√©s, but "absurd solemnity" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about societal narratives.</comment>
