<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's reincarnated past and guilt are compelling, but her "tentatively fierce" attribute feels underdeveloped. The toy soldier connection is strong, but her motivation to disrupt tradition could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The weather-driven encounter works, but the "doctor’s chart" reference feels abrupt and underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The timeframe clash (doctor’s chart) slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (toy soldier, library transformation) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of guilt could be deeper. Dialogue is natural but minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on tropes (reincarnation, broken objects as symbols). Some phrasing feels formulaic ("haunting echo"). Emotional nuance is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, but a few elements (doctor’s chart) disrupt flow. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
