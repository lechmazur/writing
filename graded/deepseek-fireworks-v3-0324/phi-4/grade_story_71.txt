<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thistle's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. His actions align with his oath, but deeper emotional nuance would elevate his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The virtual reality method feels slightly forced, but the connection between beginning and end is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered, with evocative sensory details. The fossilized giant and lines in the earth are compelling, but the virtual reality clashes tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrasing feels formulaic. The tone of "fervent apathy" isn't fully realized, and the virtual encounters lack freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the virtual reality element weakens immersion. The length feels deliberate, though some themes remain underdeveloped.</comment>
