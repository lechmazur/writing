<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is intriguing but somewhat abstract; his "cosmic order" justification lacks depth. His actions align, but his voice is muted by the poetic prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over concrete cause-and-effect. The lens-as-weapon twist is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight create a haunting, immersive setting. Sensory details elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with vivid metaphors (e.g., "spider's web after rain"), though the theme of cosmic balance feels slightly pretentious.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original but uneven—some phrases verge on purple prose ("cradled the dawn"). The assassin's detachment feels more stylistic than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, but the esoteric elements occasionally overshadow narrative clarity. Leaves a lingering, if ambiguous, impression.</comment>
