<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed. The connection between the whistle and the encrypted messages is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but lack depth. The brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
