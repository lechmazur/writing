<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration. His "proud humility" is stated rather than shown, and his "eloquently silent" demeanor isn't fully utilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed. The connection between the classroom and the electronic wilderness is unclear, and the pacing struggles within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, but the "hush of a classroom" feels disconnected from the electronic wilderness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is present but undermined by some generic phrasing ("heart full of hope"). The tone shifts awkwardly between poetic and mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by its elements. The brief length works, but the execution lacks polish.</comment>
