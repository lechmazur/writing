<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The monarch's motivation is clear but their "lethargically energetic" attribute feels underdeveloped. The puzzle pieces and feather method add depth, but their regal bearing lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in the resolution. The ember of choice concept drives the narrative but could be more tightly woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The acid rain forest is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "prickly wonder" tone occasionally clashes with the corrosive setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (puzzle pieces, feather) and a memorable theme, but the emotional resonance is muted by overly abstract language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original but uneven—some metaphors feel fresh (e.g., "ember of choice"), while others ("prickly wonder") verge on cliché. The prose occasionally slips into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ending lingers, though the journey lacks full thematic payoff.</comment>
