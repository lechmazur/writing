<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending whimsy with profound purpose. Her "thoughtfully thoughtless" approach is intriguing but could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, though the goose method feels slightly underdeveloped as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (bellows, ocean whispers) enhancing atmosphere. The glass-walled observatory is a standout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the goose method feels slightly forced. Length is deliberate, leaving room for deeper exploration.</comment>
