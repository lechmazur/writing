<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "sincere rebel" trait feels underdeveloped. The braided bitterness is evocative but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The passage's twists mirror her internal struggle well, though the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage and stormy timeframe create strong atmosphere, but some sensory details are generic (e.g., "damp earth").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (sticky note, passage) is effective, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. The ending is purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (haunted passage, rebel archetype). Some phrases feel formulaic ("heart pounded in her chest").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack surprise. The length feels deliberate, though the theme of preservation is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
