<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's "romantically doomed" nature and "raucously silent" demeanor are vividly portrayed, but her motivation to preserve craft techniques could be more deeply explored to align with her paradoxical traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the celestial event feels underutilized as a driving force. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story's theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholic resonance.</comment>
