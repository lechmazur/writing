<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's selective mutism and ventriloquism are intriguing but underdeveloped. His optimism is clear, but his motivation to archive weather patterns feels tangential to the core theme.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies heavily on contrivance (overheard calls). Pacing is smooth, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is evocative but underutilized. Sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong, and the theme of found family is poignant. However, symbolism (Sylvia) is heavy-handed, and the ending leans sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some elements (parallel universe, euphoric agitation) feel forced. The voice is distinct but occasionally slips into clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the length strains believability. Leaves a lingering warmth, though depth is surface-level.</comment>
