<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her unique ability to taste memories is well-integrated into her actions and personality, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the stadium and the valley feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The yodeling valley and stadium create an intriguing contrast, but sensory details are uneven—some vivid (tasting memories), others underdeveloped (soundscapes).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (paperclip, rain trails) and emotional resonance, though the ending leans slightly toward overt resolution rather than subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors (e.g., "synthetically organic"), though a few phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thematic impact, though the stadium setting slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
