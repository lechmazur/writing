<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear but his cynicism feels underdeveloped. Liora's warmth contrasts well, but her backstory is thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the speed dating event feels contrived. Pacing is uneven, rushing the bond between characters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its word limit. Lacks lingering depth.</comment>
