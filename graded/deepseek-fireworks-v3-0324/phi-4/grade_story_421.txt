<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "ferociously polite" demeanor feels underutilized. Her actions align with her mission, but her distinct voice is muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the mariner’s wheel driving the action logically. The resolution feels earned, though the coin toss intro is slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The mariner’s wheel’s mystery is well-integrated, though the timeframe feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wheel, scroll) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful, but the "anguished joy" tone occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (chosen one, ancient wisdom). Some phrases verge on flowery, though the core idea feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the coin toss and secret mission feel forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
