<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, blending academic rigor with a touch of supernatural intuition. Her "quietly dramatic" voice adds depth, though her physician background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the coffee grounds and cutlass serving as clever catalysts. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "scramble" action could be more urgent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original—sterile tech meets mystical archaeology. The camp’s contrast with ancient relics is evocative, though the "horizon’s edge" timeframe feels abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft: symbolism (coffee as prophecy), layered themes (history vs. myth), and a haunting ending. Literary devices elevate the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh and inventive, avoiding clichés. The coffee-ground method is strikingly original, though the "dire enchantment" tone occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of mystery. Only the nomad camp feels slightly forced.</comment>
