<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and compelling, blending cynicism with resilience. Her delicate yet lethal nature is well-established, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the secret's weight, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The swamp's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with fireflies and murkiness enhancing tension. Sensory details (corroded cameo, pressed seaweed) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cameo, fireflies) and subtext (trauma transformed). Ending is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overworked. Theme of resilience shines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, avoiding clichés, but occasional phrases ("peaceful frenzy") feel forced. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though stylistic flourishes risk purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the swamp and secret serving the story’s depth. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about revolution’s cost.</comment>
