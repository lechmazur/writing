<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aleksander's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his exile, but his "unintentionally iconic" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the snowstorm and chance encounter driving momentum, though the key-turning moment could be more explicitly linked to the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "unseen forces" concept edges toward vagueness, and the prince archetype risks clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story's themes of exile and transformation, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>
