<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, though her "uncommonly typical" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her scholarly rigor and hidden passion are well-balanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elena's experiment, but the capsule hotel's role feels underutilized. Pacing is strong, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, blending scientific and mystical tones effectively. The capsule hotel's "charged stillness" is evocative, but its time-travel aspect lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wire coil, well) and emotional resonance. The theme of emotional transmission is layered, though the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "earthbound flight" feels forced. The wire coil and well are fresh metaphors, and Elena's nuance elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though some elements (time travelers) distract. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection on emotional legacy.</comment>
