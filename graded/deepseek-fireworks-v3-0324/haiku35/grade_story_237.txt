<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply personal, aligning well with her traits. Her use of the dice reveals her methodical yet intuitive approach, though her "proudly humble" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elena's investigation, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the cosmic event's connection to her lineage. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with stellar remnants and the brig's atmosphere enhancing the mood. Sensory details (e.g., dice clinking, mechanical hums) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, diary) and subtext (destiny as a tapestry). The ending is purposeful but could delve deeper into the cosmic event's implications. Theme of healing is clear but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "quantum entanglements"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "grave playfulness" tone could be more distinct. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about familial cosmic connections, though the pirate ship setting slightly detracts from focus.</comment>
