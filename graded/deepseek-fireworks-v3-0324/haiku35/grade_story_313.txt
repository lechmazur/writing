<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is nuanced and clear, blending rebellion with a desire for chaos. His "unusually normal" mediocrity and spectral interrogations reveal depth, though his voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's grift driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect logic (remorse â†’ rebellion) is compelling. Minor tension dip pre-transmission.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dystopian farm is vividly rendered, with rusted drones and barren fields amplifying desolation. The tape dispenser's symbolism ties seamlessly to the setting's decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the tape dispenser as symbol, ghostly subtext, and a rebellious theme. Ending thrums with purpose. Only lacks a gut-punch emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. Ghost interrogations are inventive, though "mild fervor" tone occasionally wavers. No AI clunkiness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Lingers on the cost of institutional control. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
