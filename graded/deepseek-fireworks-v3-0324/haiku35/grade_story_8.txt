<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lady Cordelia's motivation is clear and compelling, blending intellectual rebellion with familial legacy. Her "empirically rebellious" nature is vividly portrayed, though her noble background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her audacious mission, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending, while purposeful, could feel more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is a masterful setting, rich with sensory details that amplify the story's mood. The connection between setting and concept is seamless and evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of generational knowledge is layered. However, the ending lacks the emotional punch needed to elevate it to perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the voice feels distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the brevity slightly limits its depth. It lingers intellectually but not viscerally.</comment>
