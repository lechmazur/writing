<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, blending defiance of genetic limits with a desperate attempt to revive his park. His "sweetly fierce" demeanor adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marcus's mission, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground fairy city is vividly rendered, with crystalline caverns and bioluminescent details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply influences the plot and character, though the "cosmic hush" timeframe feels abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the fan as a conduit) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict's resolution could be more nuanced. Themes of transformation are well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The fairy realm's magic feels fresh, though some phrases ("volatile as fire") verge on overused. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the fan and fairy city standing out. The brevity works, but the walkie-talkie feels underutilized. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
