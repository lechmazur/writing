<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's overworked state and personal reckoning are well-conveyed, but his "confidently unsure" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated in his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains tension, but the resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit. The kaleidoscope's role in driving the narrative could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting and post-siren hush create a haunting atmosphere, though the connection between the kaleidoscope and the gallery could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (Jack of Hearts, kaleidoscope) and subtext, but the "molten sarcasm" tone is underutilized in dialogue or narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("psychological labyrinth") edge toward cliché. The kaleidoscope metaphor is fresh but slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story’s brevity slightly limits thematic depth. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>
