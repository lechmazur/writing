<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is poetic and distinct, though slightly abstract. Her actions align with her philosophical approach to assassination, but her "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect. The spider's web method is inventive, though the ending's metaphysical shift risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered, with prismatic reflections and metallic corridors enhancing the ethereal, predatory mood. Sensory details are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and literary devices (e.g., the camera as a witness). The ending's duality of destruction/transformation lingers. Style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases ("borrowed starlight") edge toward over-poeticism. Avoids clich√©s but could temper ornate language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance. A standout fusion of concept and execution.</comment>
