<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized, with his somber troubadour persona and inherited trauma driving his actions. His motivation to break generational curses is clear and consistent, though his "steadily unpredictable" approach could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between the launch site and Marcus's emotional journey is strong, though the pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned rocket launch site is a masterful setting, evoking desolation and ambition. Sensory details (rusted gantries, fading sunlight) deepen the atmosphere, though the "hushed euphoria" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (ring, tablecloths) and a resonant theme of healing. The ending is satisfying, though the "torpedo" metaphor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases verge on overly ornate, but the voice is distinct and avoids clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the "cryptic stanzas" method could be more integrated.</comment>
