<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's nervous yet determined demeanor is well-developed, and his motivation to promote communal gardening is clear and consistent. His actions align with his mission, though his "kingpin" title feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marcus's detour, though the landmark discovery feels convenient. Pacing is tight, but the resolution with the young woman is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The midwinter setting and xenophobic enclave are vividly rendered, enhancing tension. Sensory details (frost, seed pods) deepen immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seed pods as "silent ambassadors") and subtext (resistance through growth). The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "fragile ferocity" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s but leans on predictable outsider-vs.-isolation conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a resonant question about change, though the detour's payoff could be sharper.</comment>
