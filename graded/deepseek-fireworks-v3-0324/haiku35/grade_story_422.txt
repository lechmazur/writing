<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's selective mutism and ventriloquism are well-integrated, revealing depth through Winston. His optimism and mission feel authentic, though his sudden emotional shift at the end could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the sister's appearance feels abrupt. The weather-archive premise is inventive but underutilized in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly rendered with lavender waves and geometric clouds, enhancing the story's ethereal mood. The coffee sleeve's symbolism is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (Winston, the sleeve) and emotional resonance, though the ending's thematic punch could be sharper. Dialogue is purposeful, but the researcher's patronizing feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "lavender luminescence"). Avoids clich√©s, though the sister's reintroduction leans slightly toward trope. Nuanced handling of Marcus's silence stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the parallel universe and weather mission adding intrigue. The brevity feels deliberate, though some threads (e.g., the diner call) could be tighter.</comment>
