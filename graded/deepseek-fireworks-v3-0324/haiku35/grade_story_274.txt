<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivations are subtly conveyed through her actions and the symbolic bookmark, but the sentient plant's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, but the transition to the drive-in feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the abandoned drive-in's liminal quality. The setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, subtext) are masterfully employed. The ending is purposeful and resonant, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The prose avoids clich√©s, though the plant's sentience borders on gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, suggesting depth beyond the text.</comment>
