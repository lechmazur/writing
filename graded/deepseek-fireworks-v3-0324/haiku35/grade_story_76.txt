<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (brass magnifier as a talisman, redacted text as portals) and a layered theme of narrative transcendence make this story linger. The ending is both satisfying and open to interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that never feels forced. The brevity enhances the storyâ€™s dreamlike intensity, leaving a resonant afterimage.</comment>
