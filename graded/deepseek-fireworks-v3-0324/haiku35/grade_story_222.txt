<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "philosophically shallow" attribute feels underdeveloped. The washcloth and pendant reveal depth, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The method of energetic negotiation is inventive and logically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (e.g., the washcloth's luminescence) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (washcloth, pendant) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of subtle power resonates deeply. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "harmonic resonances"). Avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite constraints. The story lingers, suggesting depth beyond its brevity. Elements serve the narrative, not vice versa.</comment>
