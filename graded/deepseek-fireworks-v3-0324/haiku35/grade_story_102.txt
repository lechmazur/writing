<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from a mercenary to a determined protector is compelling, though his "spineless" trait could be more consistently shown before his resolve crystallizes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the prophecy and key serving as strong drivers. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "forgotten trails" method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly atmospheric, and the "luminous doubt" tone enhances the eerie, scholarly mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the key as cipher) and layered themes (silencing knowledge) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue leans slightly expositional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "grandly trivial" feels forced. The prose is lush but controlled, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "crucible of potential energy").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of silencing truth.</comment>
