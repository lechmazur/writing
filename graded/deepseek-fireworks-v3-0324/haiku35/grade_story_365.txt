<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The deflated oracle's paradoxical nature and meticulous actions reveal depth, though her "independently dependent" attribute could be more explicitly woven into her motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with the rope-rebraiding action driving a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the carnival's decay and dreamlike details amplify the oracle's ritual, though the ring toss booth's relevance could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though some phrases verge on over-poetic ("melancholic glee"). The rope ritual is brilliantly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered vignette that lingers, though the subconscious realm could be more fully integrated.</comment>
