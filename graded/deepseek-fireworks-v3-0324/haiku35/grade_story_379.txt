<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, blending legal evasion with linguistic preservation. His "impatiently patient" nature is well-explored, though his trickster lawyer background could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elena's cryptic dares, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing its contrast between technological precision and organic chaos. The atmosphere supports Marcus's mission and the story's themes beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the gift tag as symbolism) are effective, and the theme of cultural resistance is layered. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of linguistic preservation and futuristic intrigue. The prose avoids clich√©s, though some metaphors (e.g., "living organisms") verge on predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering question about legacy, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
