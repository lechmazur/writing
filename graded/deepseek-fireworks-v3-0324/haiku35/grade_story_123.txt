<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, blending his brewing background with a melancholic mission. His "gleefully morose" demeanor adds nuance, though his eagerness could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with sweeping as both literal and symbolic action. The arc from exploration to potential resurrection feels complete, though the political context could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—dust, starlight, and tactile details immerse the reader. The abandoned facility and "crisp nostalgia" tone amplify the theme of rediscovery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: metaphors (e.g., "spectral threads"), layered subtext about cultural preservation, and a hauntingly purposeful ending. Minor overuse of "dust" imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("tomb of lost knowledge"), though "gleefully morose" risks cliché. Avoids AI pitfalls but could push further in emotional subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Elements serve the story’s depth, leaving a lingering question about intellectual legacy. Minor pacing lags in middle.</comment>
