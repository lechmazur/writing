<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Helena's confusion and diplomatic background are well-integrated, but her "joyfully tragic" attribute feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bird imagery and salt mine setting elegantly driving the philosophical arc. Minor pacing hiccups in the bus scene.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt mine's eerie ambiance is vividly rendered, though the bus ride's sensory details could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette that transcends its constraints. Leaves a lingering metaphysical weight.</comment>
