<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "bitterly optimistic" nature driving her actions. Her distinct voice and reaction to the parking stub reveal depth, though her heiress backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the parking stub's quantum role driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The research station and migrating clouds create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the stub's glow) enhance the mood, though the xenobiology setting could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stub as quantum key) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly memorable, and the theme of interconnected realities is explored with literary finesse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The "reckless precision" tone is unique, though the heiress trope leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
