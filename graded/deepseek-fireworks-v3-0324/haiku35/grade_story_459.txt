<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his ghost-seeing ability and repair skills blending seamlessly into his investigative approach. His "elegantly clumsy" demeanor adds depth, though his dialogue could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's methodical investigation and the ghost's revelations driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the sand castle lab's relevance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lab's eerie atmosphere is vivid, but the sand castle setting feels underutilized. The flower crown and elevator whispers enhance mood, though sensory details could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flower crown, elevator) and subtext about suppressed history. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of liberation through witnessing is poignant. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (elevator as narrative mechanism). Avoids clich√©s, though "complex simplicity" tone wobbles. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers due to its thematic depth.</comment>
