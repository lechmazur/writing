<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his sister's disappearance driving his actions. His tense demeanor and calculated rebellion align well with his backstory, though his "voice" could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from tension to strategic defiance. The lunar greenhouse setting enhances the rebellion metaphor, though the transition from Earth to moon could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered, with Earth's distant silhouette and biological rhythms amplifying the story's themes. Sensory details (e.g., the worn photograph) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (plants as rebellion) and subtext (corporate control vs. autonomy). The ending is purposeful, though the "serene anger" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., plant cells as rebirth). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing ("serine anger") feels slightly forced. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with its themes of resistance and transformation, though the lunar setting's uniqueness slightly overshadows other elements.</comment>
