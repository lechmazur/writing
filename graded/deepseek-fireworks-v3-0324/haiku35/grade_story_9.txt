<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and compelling, blending scientific and mystical elements. Her "mild panic" adds depth, though her sarcasm could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each lock symbolizing an ecosystem, creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The billboard maze and neon-lit desert are vividly rendered, enhancing the dystopian tone. Sensory details (flickering lights, dust) immerse the reader brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (water rings, puzzle box) and layered themes (environmental collapse vs. hope) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fusion of prophecy and ecology feels inventive, though some metaphors verge on overworked ("dying circuit boards").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story’s core. Leaves a haunting impression, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
