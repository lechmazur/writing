<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's off-grid survivalist background and enigmatic demeanor are compelling, but his aristocratic title feels slightly incongruous. Elena's role is well-integrated but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is excellent, though the raft moment feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered, with grotesque beauty and immersive sensory details. Atmosphere perfectly supports the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the "luminous doubt" motif could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("organic archive") slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional.</comment>
