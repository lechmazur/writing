<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Captain Aria's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her background as a desert wanderer and archivist. Her obsession with translating love is compelling, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her research, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the revelation. Cause-and-effect is logical, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crow's nest setting and atmospheric details (stasis-preserved apple, brass ruler's vibrations) are evocative and enhance the story's mood. Sensory immersion is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ruler as conduit, apple as memory) and layered themes elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional resonance is nuanced, though a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about love's measurability, showcasing depth.</comment>
