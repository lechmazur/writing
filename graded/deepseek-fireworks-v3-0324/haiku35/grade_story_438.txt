<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's mystic-scientist duality is compelling, but her "hollow recklessness" feels underdeveloped. The compass interaction reveals depth, but her motivation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's scientific-mystical fusion is intriguing, but the transition from polaroids to genetic experiments feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, but coherence wavers near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's sterile contrast with the compass's mysticism is masterful. Sensory details (glowing compass, humming lab) elevate atmosphere, though timeframe integration is subtle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (compass as genetic map) and layered themes (memory vs. science) stand out. Ending is poetic but slightly opaque. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, though "hollow recklessness" feels forced. Metaphors (compass as "synthetic womb") are fresh. Style balances lyricism and precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole, but the star map timeframe feels underutilized. Leaves a lingering question about ancestral memory's limits.</comment>
