<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "awe" as an astronomer feels underdeveloped compared to her emotional and philosophical depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically rich, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of her moral dilemma.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the story's mood and themes, though the "orchard" feels slightly underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("rationally organic") verge on over-formal abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette that transcends its constraints, though the snowflake method could feel more urgent.</comment>
