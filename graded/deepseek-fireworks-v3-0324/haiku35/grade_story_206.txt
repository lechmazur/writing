<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, blending artistry with vengeance. Her "precisely creative" approach to revenge is unique and well-developed, though her emotional depth could be further nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from personal vendetta to broader historical restoration. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the rebellion's context could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details that enhance the story's mood. The setting and timeframe work seamlessly to support Elena's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sugar as resistance) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of memory as rebellion is powerfully conveyed. Minor room for deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The sugar-as-weapon concept is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Some descriptors could be more vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
