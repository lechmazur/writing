<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thomas's conscientious objection and mapping mission are well-integrated, but his "valiantly bored" state feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the migration mapping arc could be more dynamically woven into immediate action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard and storm-battered ravine are vividly rendered, though the "coy malevolence" tone occasionally clashes with the story's quieter themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rusty nail, migration maps) and subtext, but the ending lacks a definitive emotional or thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise and nuanced handling of war/peace duality, though some phrases ("coy malevolence") verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity slightly undermines its thematic weight; feels like a vignette rather than a complete arc.</comment>
