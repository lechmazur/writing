<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jack's motivation is clear and consistent, blending gambling intellect with historical obsession. His actions align well, though his "amiable" nature could be more vividly shown through dialogue or interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the charity drives as a method for intelligence gathering feels underexplored. Pacing is deliberate but risks stagnation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and humid twilight are evocatively rendered, enhancing the mood. However, the setting's connection to the ledger could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly with fireflies as coded messages. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply with a sharper emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The "art of unbecoming" is fresh, though the "peaceful anger" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some thematic depth is sacrificed for stylistic elegance.</comment>
