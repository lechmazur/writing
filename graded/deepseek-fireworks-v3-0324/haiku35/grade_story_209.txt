<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with the hairbrush serving as a poignant link to his sister. His woodsman-technician duality is compelling but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's quest, though the connection between the railway lines and Margaret's disappearance feels slightly underdeveloped. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "radio wave garden" is vividly rendered, with electromagnetic whispers and rusted infrastructure creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hairbrush as conduit, railways as veins) and a resonant ending. The theme of interconnected loss and discovery is layered, though the "despairing cheer" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases ("electromagnetic whispers") verge on overworked, but the emotional nuance and fresh metaphors stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on memory and invisible connections.</comment>
