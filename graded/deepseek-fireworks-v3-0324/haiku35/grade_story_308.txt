<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's dual identity as an executioner and cultural preserver is compelling, but his bashfulness feels underdeveloped. The keychain as a token of remembrance is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the urgency of the dance preservation feels slightly rushed. The floating yoga studio is an intriguing but underutilized setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the keychain, sea foam). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of cultural survival could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "movements so delicate they could dissolve like sea foam"). The executioner's passion for dance is a surprising twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though the floating yoga studio feels slightly gimmicky. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of cultural urgency.</comment>
