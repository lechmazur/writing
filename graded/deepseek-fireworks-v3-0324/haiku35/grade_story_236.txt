<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from blacksmith to bureaucrat is compelling, but his meekness feels underutilized in driving action. His motivation is clear but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection, slowing momentum. The lighthouse revelation is strong, but the hitchhiker method feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly atmospheric, though its connection to Marcus's emotional state is slightly overplayed. Sensory details are evocative but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, but the ending's thematic weight relies too much on exposition. The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though some metaphors (e.g., "forge heartbreak") verge on clich√©. The narrative avoids AI pitfalls but could risk pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the hitchhiker device weakens cohesion. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting but slightly unresolved impression.</comment>
