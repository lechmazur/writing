<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cordelia's motivation is clear and compelling, blending noble heritage with scientific ambition. Her actions align well with her traits, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her experiment, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab setting and hummingbird drone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (metallic wings, pulsing light) enhance mood and concept synergy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ticket stubs as memory) and subtext (challenging scientific dogma). Ending is purposeful, though emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The hummingbird drone and ticket-stub method feel fresh. Some phrases verge on overly ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of memory/energy lingers. A few more vivid details would elevate it further.</comment>
