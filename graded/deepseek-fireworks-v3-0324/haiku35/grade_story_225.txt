<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The method of tracking butterflies via morse code is inventive but slightly strained in plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like the creaking deck and humming machinery immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and wonder, with strong use of symbolism (butterflies as migratory beings). The ending is satisfying, though the central conflict (scientific ostracization) could be sharper.</comment>
