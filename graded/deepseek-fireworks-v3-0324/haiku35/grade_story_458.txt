<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her role as a guardian of narratives, though her "spiritually secular" attribute could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coffee stains and coat button serving as elegant pivots between introspection and action. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is a haunting, evocative setting that amplifies the theme of loss. Sensory details (e.g., the glinting button, dust-laden air) are precise and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coffee stains as timelines, the button as a microcosm). The ending resonates with thematic weight and emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "fractal sorrow" edges toward abstraction. The story avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., coffee stains) risk over-familiarity in literary SF.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished vignette that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and connection.</comment>
