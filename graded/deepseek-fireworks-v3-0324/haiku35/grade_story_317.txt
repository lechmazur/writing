<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit-7's emotional recall and programmed directive create a compelling, nuanced android with clear motivation, though its "anxiously fearless" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the crystal-growth method feels underdeveloped as a catalyst for betrayal. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The levitation facility and dawn setting are vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (brass telescope, crystalline chambers) enhancing the mood of impending crisis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crystals as records of betrayal) and a resonant ending, though some metaphors verge on overworked. Theme of sacrifice is clear but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise, but "patterns of betrayal" and "brazen modesty" tone occasionally feel forced. Some phrasing leans toward AI-formulaic ("electric anticipation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the telescope and facility serving the narrative well. Length feels deliberate, though crystals' role lacks depth.</comment>
