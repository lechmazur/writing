<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's morbid florist profession and her scientific yet poetic approach to decay are vividly portrayed, but her "neutrally passionate" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically rich, but the floating rock dojo feels slightly disconnected from the core narrative of botanical decay.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly immersive, with sensory details (wilting roses, guttering lantern) enhancing the theme of transience. The setting is evocative but slightly incongruous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (candle as life/death metaphor) and layered subtext. The ending crystallizes the theme beautifully, though the "floating rock" element slightly dilutes focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "chlorophyll and memory"), though "boldly timid" tone feels contrived. Avoids clich√©s but risks over-poeticizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thought-provoking, with elements mostly serving the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, though the dojo distracts from the botanical focus.</comment>
