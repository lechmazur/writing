<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus Holloway is vividly realized, with his military weariness and contemplative depth. His motivation—reconstructing memory—is clear and aligns with his actions, though his "rationally absurd" attribute could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc within the tight word limit, but the connection between the seaweed and photographs feels slightly underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner is an evocative, immersive setting that enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (the crumbling seaweed, dim lighting) are used effectively to deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of collective anxiety is explored with nuance. Dialogue is sparse but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés. The seaweed as a conduit for memory is fresh, though the "mischievous wisdom" tone feels slightly forced. Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite the constraints. The story lingers, suggesting depth beyond the narrative. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
