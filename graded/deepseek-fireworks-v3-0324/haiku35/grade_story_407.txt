<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and aligns with her traits, but her "unlucky" aspect feels underdeveloped. The sextant as a talisman is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the "shortcut" element feels abrupt. The elder's arrival resolves tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground city is vividly rendered, and the bioluminescent fungi add depth. The "bitter honey" tone is slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sextant, murals) and subtext, but the ending's stakes could be sharper. Dialogue is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, though "systematically chaotic" feels forced. The lizard elder’s voice is distinct and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements (e.g., "shortcut") weaken momentum. Leaves a lingering question about ecological balance.</comment>
