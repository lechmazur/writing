<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's late-bloomer identity and gentle swordsman persona are well-integrated, though his "faithfully unfaithful" relationship with truth could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the sundial's cosmic revelation feels slightly abrupt. The orchard dog's barks are a subtle but effective temporal anchor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly atmospheric, with skeletal shadows and creaking bones enhancing Marcus's contemplative mood. The sundial's placement feels organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (matchbox, bones) and subtext (patience, discovery), though the cosmic secret's profundity risks overshadowing the character's arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("faithfully unfaithful," "cradle the universe"), though "brusque affection" tone isn't fully realized in the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the matchbox and sundial serving the theme of latent potential. Only the cosmic scale feels slightly dissonant.</comment>
