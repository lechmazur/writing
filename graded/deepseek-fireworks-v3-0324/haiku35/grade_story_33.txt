<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's fractured yet reconstructed persona is vividly portrayed, with her mask symbolizing her internal state. Her motivation—asserting cosmic chaos—is clear but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on philosophical musings over action. The cosmic blink ties the narrative together, though pacing feels contemplative rather than dynamic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The leaf classification office and ghostlike reflections create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (porcelain mask, marble floor) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mask, sparrow) and layered themes (chaos, nonviolence) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the philosophical density may alienate some readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clichés. The mask metaphor and cosmic chaos theme feel fresh, though the prose occasionally verges on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about chaos and control, though the brevity limits full exploration.</comment>
