<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her grandmother's cryptic legacy, but her "overzealous" nature as a park ranger feels underdeveloped compared to her role as a witness to the orchard's transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's surreal coherence is masterful, with the orchard's fluctuations driving the narrative toward a resonant, if ambiguous, resolution. Pacing is tight yet immersive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is breathtakingly vivid, merging decay and divinity with sensory precision. Atmosphere elevates every thematic and character beat.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pomegranate, notebook) and layered subtext. The ending’s paradox—irrelevant yet essential—lingers with haunting brilliance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, visionary vignette. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for the reader’s awe. Elements serve the story’s transcendent ambition.</comment>
