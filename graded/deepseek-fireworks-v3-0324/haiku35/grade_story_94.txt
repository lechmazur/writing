<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation and profession are compelling, but her "femme fatale" aspect feels underdeveloped. Her restlessly curious nature is well-integrated, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the physicist's backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sky reflection pool and time-travel setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (light, ripples) are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (earrings, cloud trails) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "gravity of desires" borders on abstraction. Nuanced emotional handling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering philosophical weight. Feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
