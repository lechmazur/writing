<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving her actions consistently. Her "eagerly jaded" demeanor and dance background enrich her investigative method, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cryptic clues and auditions serving dual purposes. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the voice-note method slightly strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" and "graceless beauty" of the audition hall are vividly rendered, enhancing tension. Sensory details (e.g., the glove's texture) deepen immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the glove as talisman), layered themes (grief into resilience), and a defiantly poetic ending elevate this. Literary devices are wielded masterfully, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "fearless laugh at mortality" motif feels slightly forced. Nuanced emotion shines, but a few phrases ("electric potential of revelation") edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Only the voice-note mechanic slightly disrupts the otherwise seamless execution.</comment>
