<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "grim sentinel" persona feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his goal of escape, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from confinement to impending liberation. The coin-toss method is inventive and drives the narrative forward logically, though the "between shows" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is vividly rendered, with shadows and light used masterfully to enhance the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Marcus's isolation and the tension of his escape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (the pamphlet, the coins) and a haunting, melodic prose style. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of algorithmic disruption via coin melodies is ingenious, though some phrases verge on overly ornate ("intimate separation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of liberation lingers powerfully.</comment>
