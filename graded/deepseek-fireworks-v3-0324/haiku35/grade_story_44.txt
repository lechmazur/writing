<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lamp's discovery driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes the thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The space debris studio and the lamp's cosmic origins are meaningfully connected, enriching the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the lamp as an archive) and subtext (redemption through preservation). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>
