<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin's calmness and precision as an assassin are well-integrated with her botanical press and decoding method, but her motivation could be more explicitly tied to personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prophecy's transformation serving as a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "humorous unease" tone slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace setting is vividly atmospheric, and the botanical specimens enrich the world. Sensory details are evocative, but the "humorous unease" clashes with the otherwise solemn tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext, with the butterfly wing motif and prophecy weaving. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the "humorous unease" detracts slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The botanical press and decoding method stand out, but the "figuratively literal" phrasing feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, though the "humorous unease" weakens impact.</comment>
