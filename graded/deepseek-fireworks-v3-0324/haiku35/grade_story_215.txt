<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's background as a rattled exorcist and her motivation to bridge science and the supernatural are compelling, but her "inwardly social" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through interactions or internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the postcard and puzzle method driving the narrative logically toward the hidden room reveal. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s core theme. Leaves the reader pondering the permeable boundaries of knowledge.</comment>
