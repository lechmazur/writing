<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with her flighty nature transformed into a strength. Her "serene anger" and desire for legacy are compelling, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with linearizing chaos as a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the initiation hall's mundanity slightly undercuts tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is functional but lacks deeper immersion. The "strangely normal" initiation hall contrasts well with the extraordinary task, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (overalls patch, paintings) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of hidden connections is elegantly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "flicker of unity" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of emotion and fresh metaphors elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of revelation.</comment>
