<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's insomnia and artistic obsession are vividly portrayed, driving his actions with a clear, haunting motivation. His distinct voice and psychological depth stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's scrying and final brushstroke forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the mushroom setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop and predawn hush create a mesmerizing, liminal atmosphere. Sensory details (moonlight in puddles, creaking wood) deepen the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bullet-holed hat, painted smiles) and subtext. The ending lingers, revealing trauma beneath performance with masterful subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "frolicsome regret" tone and mushroom workshop feel fresh, though "peacefully chaotic" slightly strains the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the theme brilliantly, and the brevity amplifies its impact. Leaves the reader unsettled in the best way.</comment>
