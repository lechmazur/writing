<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and poetic, but her "underground poet" identity feels underdeveloped beyond surface-level traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the map's tear serving as a compelling narrative anchor, though the crocheting feels slightly forced as a parallel action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The basement's eerie atmosphere is masterfully rendered, but the "witch's familiar menagerie" lacks deeper integration beyond aesthetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext, with the map's tear as a metaphor for narrative fragmentation. The ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though "disinterested passion" as a tone occasionally clashes with the prose's lyrical intensity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, though some elements (crocheting, menagerie) feel more decorative than essential to the core theme.</comment>
