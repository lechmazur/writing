<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with her jaded locksmith background subtly informing her strategic actions. Her 'voice' is distinct, though more dialogue could deepen her portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pottery class serving as a clever fulcrum for political intrigue. Pacing is excellent, though the throne's significance could be earlier emphasized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard and colonial town are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details (gloves, clay) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (gloves as rebellion, pottery as coded messages) elevates the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of generational quest could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The gloves and pottery class are inventive tools for political maneuvering. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of Elena's calculated ambition.</comment>
