<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Karim's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his lineage, but his "weary undertaker" role feels slightly underutilized in favor of his tribal identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the astronomical clock and sun paths driving the action logically. The resolution is subtle yet satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace and its decayed grandeur are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (brass gears, marble floors) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (clock as map, light as prison) and subtext. The ending lingers, prompting reflection on power and perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
