<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with clear motivation, but his "timidly loud" presence could be more consistently demonstrated in dialogue and action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the storm metaphor is compelling but could be more tightly woven into the linguistic decoding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-chasing HQ and ancient languages create a rich, contrasting atmosphere, though the "forgotten dance" tone feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks a definitive punch. The theme of universal connections is evocative but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though the "timidly loud" attribute occasionally feels forced. No AI clich√©s detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the storm HQ setting slightly distracts from the linguistic focus. Leaves a lingering question about cultural transmission.</comment>
