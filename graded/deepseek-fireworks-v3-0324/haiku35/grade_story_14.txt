<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the energy transfer protocol driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, and the ending delivers a satisfying, if abrupt, resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (salt-laden air, humming generators) enhancing atmosphere. The candle mold's symbolic presence is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext and literary devices (e.g., the candle mold as metaphor) elevate the story. The ending's emotional resonance lingers, though Harriet's laughter borders on melodrama.</comment>
