<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his outlaw status feels underutilized. His methodical nature shines, but the "outlaw" aspect lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the paint-smudge method, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Roman marketplace is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Marcus's quest effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the pouch) are used well, but the ending's impact could be sharper. Theme of discovery is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, though the "shimmer of possibility" leans slightly generic. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers but lacks a knockout thematic punch.</comment>
