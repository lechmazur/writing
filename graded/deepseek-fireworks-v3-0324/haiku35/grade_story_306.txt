<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's background as a former child star and her current scientific obsession are well-integrated, but her "authentically odd" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the map's revelation driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber and cathedral window create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "shimmering" map, "humming machines") enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., the map as both physical object and metaphor). The theme of ambition blurring reality and science is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "wild magic of madness" phrasing edges toward clich√©. The voice is distinct, but some descriptions feel overly precise rather than vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive; elements serve the story rather than feeling forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and unresolved potential.</comment>
