<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation is clear and compelling, blending whimsy with steely resolve. Her role as a fortune cookie writer is distinct and deeply tied to her actions, though her "reliably unreliable" trait could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The "kink" in the plan adds tension, though the oracle's role feels slightly underdeveloped for such a pivotal element.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope studio and curfew-bound timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The chipped tile is a brilliant symbolic anchor, though the studio's shifting geometric patterns could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and subtext, with language itself as resistance. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Only minor tightening of the oracle's role would make it flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The fortune-cookie-as-resistance concept is fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Minor quibble: "earnest whimsy" could be more consistently embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about cultural reclamation. Near-perfect execution.</comment>
