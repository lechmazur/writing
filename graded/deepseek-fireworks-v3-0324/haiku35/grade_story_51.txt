<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and nuanced, with his past and present actions aligning well. His "rationally subjective" approach adds depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the museum meetings feel slightly contrived as a method for reinvention.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, though its connection to the wooden slat could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a satisfying ending. The dialogue is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s, though a few phrases verge on overly formal. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering thought, though the museum method slightly weakens the whole.</comment>
