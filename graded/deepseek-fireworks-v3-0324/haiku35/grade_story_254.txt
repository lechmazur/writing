<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on overworked ("time’s unraveling tapestry"). Avoids clichés impressively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, stylistically bold whole, though the star-breath conceit slightly overshadows the character's comedic paradox.</comment>
