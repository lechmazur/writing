<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her lineage, but her "peculiar collector" trait feels slightly underdeveloped. Her calmness and brilliance are well-conveyed, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to revelation. The quantum probability concept drives the narrative effectively, though the piano bench decoding feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile, humming atmosphere of the probability center contrasts beautifully with Elena's quiet intensity. Sensory details (pencil warmth, electromagnetic pulse) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (pencil as generational knowledge) and layered themes (human potential, nonlinear consciousness) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is precise yet evocative, though "fractured grace" slightly overstates Elena's demeanor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
