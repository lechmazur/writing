<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and obsessive, aligning well with his chaotic methods. His distinct voice and reactions to cosmic events reveal depth, though his "unluckiness" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Cassian's actions, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective, though the "colliding interests" could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground lizard city is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and tone ("bitter honey") complement each other beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sextant, glowing ferns) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the thematic depth could be sharper. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "spoken truths" element feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
