<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is poetic and clear, but her "naturally peculiar" attribute could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the tight word limit strains some transitions. Still, a haunting, cohesive whole.</comment>
