<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's attribute of earnest deception is well-integrated, shaping her actions and masking her fierce will. Her motivation to renew Mars is clear and consistent, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Aria's stitching and the lantern's symbolism. Pacing is effective, but some transitions feel abrupt due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Martian biodome setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The lantern and bookshop are meaningfully connected to the tone and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lantern, stitches) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope and resilience.</comment>
