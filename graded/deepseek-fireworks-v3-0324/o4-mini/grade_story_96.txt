<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's quiet fervor and restless curiosity are well-developed, but his "disinterested passion" could be more consistently shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the map's tear and the brimming cup driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The menagerie and moonlit clearing are vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (static hum, mossy stump) enhancing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (map as poetry, chalice as fate) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open to interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "liquid moonlight"), though "disinterested passion" borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
