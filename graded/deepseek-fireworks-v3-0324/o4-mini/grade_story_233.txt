<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner's naivety and motivation are clear, but her transformation lacks deeper exploration. Her "daring kindness" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the "between commercials" device disrupts momentum without clear payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The vault's gilded chains and shimmering walls enhance the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (filigree patterns, prismatic dust) and a resonant ending, but some metaphors verge on overworked ("captive moth wings").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (hidden societies, chosen ones). The "whispered legend" framing feels slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "commercials" motif feels underbaked. The lullaby motif lingers effectively.</comment>
