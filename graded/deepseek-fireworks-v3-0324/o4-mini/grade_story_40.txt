<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Azara's reincarnated goldfish caretaker identity and her guilt are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "tentatively fierce" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the storm's role in the chance encounter feels slightly contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten recipe library is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances both character and theme. Sensory details (spilled ink, flour-dusted scrolls) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (toy soldier, spilled ink) and subtext about tradition vs. chaos. The ending is satisfying, though the playful cynicism occasionally undercuts emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("guilt's haunting echo") verge on repetitive. The goldfish reincarnation premise is fresh and well-executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering reflection on tradition and reinvention.</comment>
