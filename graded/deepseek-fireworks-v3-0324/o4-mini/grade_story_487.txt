<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gideon's docile bruiser persona and disturbingly calm demeanor are well-integrated, revealing depth through his interactions with the environment and baton. His motivation to mold a myth is clear but could be more explicitly tied to his backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the shredded map and baton driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humid glass, whispering vines) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting and man-eating plants are flawlessly intertwined with the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (baton as bridge between life/death, vines as language barriers) elevates the story. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("brash tenderness," "ghostly hands") edge toward cliché. The baton's mythos and Gideon's calmness feel fresh, however.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brief length serves the story’s mythic tone, though deeper exploration of language barriers would strengthen it further.</comment>
