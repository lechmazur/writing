<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archer's disappointment and anxious calm are well-integrated, but his motivation to chronicle social movements feels slightly detached from his personal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric weight over clear cause-and-effect progression. The bridge of regret and inverted waterfall are evocative but underutilized as plot drivers.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial timeframe create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (upward raindrops, rusted rails) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, arrow) and subtext, though the ending's resolution feels muted. The theme of reconciliation with failure is poignant but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The "passionate disinterest" tone is fresh, though the comb's backstory verges on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story's brevity limits thematic depth. The archer's final act lingers, though the detour premise feels contrived.</comment>
