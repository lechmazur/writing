<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The duelist's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his flaws, but his "cheerless" nature feels slightly underdeveloped in contrast to his emotional transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the spaceport setting feels underutilized in driving the narrative forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed, but the abandoned spaceport's connection to the chest and recipes is tenuous, diluting its impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext; the ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "elasticize" action borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("elasticize grief") risk over-stylization. The emotional core feels genuine, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the spaceport setting slightly detracts from the story's emotional focus.</comment>
