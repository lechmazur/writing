<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn's sharp-wittedness and dancer's precision are well-integrated into her actions and decisions, though her linguistic ineptitude feels slightly underutilized in driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prophecy and family photo tradition creating a clear arc. Pacing is effective, though the bubble bath setting occasionally distracts from the central tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thought experiment chamber and holographic lights create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, but the bubble bath element feels incongruent with the cosmic and familial stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (patch, photos, glyphs) and layered themes of denial and legacy elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the "soap film ripples" imagery slightly undercuts its gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its blending of cosmic and domestic tragedy. The prose avoids clichés, though a few phrases ("static echoes of cosmic failure") verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story’s depth. The length feels deliberate, though the bubble bath motif slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
