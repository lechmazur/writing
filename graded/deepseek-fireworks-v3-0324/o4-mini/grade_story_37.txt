<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's duality as a reformed con artist is compelling, but his motivation to become a guardian feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his past, though the transition could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolic revelations. The detour feels tangential, and the pacing wavers between meditative and rushed in the waiting room.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, but its contrast with the sterile clinic isn't fully exploited. Sensory details are lush but occasionally overwhelm the present setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the "dishonestly honest" theme sometimes muddles clarity. The ending is satisfying but risks melodrama with the flame metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, but the "earnest whimsy" tone clashes at times. Avoids clich√©s, though the con artist trope is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce creatively, but the construction detour and waiting room feel like forced juxtapositions. The brevity works, but some themes need more room to breathe.</comment>
