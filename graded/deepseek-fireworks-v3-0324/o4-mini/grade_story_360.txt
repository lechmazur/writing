<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's quiet yearning and fractured destiny are compelling, but his "peculiarly sincere" devotion could be more deeply explored to align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc, but the dew-drop method feels slightly contrived, and the goblin playground's role is underutilized for tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (moonlight, moss, laughter), though the goblin city's uniqueness could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the ending's renewal of faith feels abrupt. The "tangled tapestry" imagery is memorable but over-relied upon.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though some phrases ("argent luminescence") edge toward purple prose. Emotional resonance is nuanced but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the dew-drop method and playground sounds feel slightly tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
