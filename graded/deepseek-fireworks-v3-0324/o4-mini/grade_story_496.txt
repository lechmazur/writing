<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's repression and terror are vividly portrayed, but their motivation to pen a cosmic verse feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the ambush of memories and spontaneous decision driving momentum, though the pin-drop moment's significance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the overgrown street and perfume bottle create a haunting, immersive world. Sensory details (scent of stars, ivy-clad facades) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: cosmic void metaphors, starlight tattoos, and fragile-verses symbolism elevate the story. Ending balances triumph and vulnerability beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "perfume as constellation guide"), though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés but risks slight pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. Leaves a lingering question about art's fragility—more depth than the word limit suggests.</comment>
