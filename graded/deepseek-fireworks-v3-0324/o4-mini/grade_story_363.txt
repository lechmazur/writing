<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The miner's grief and clinical admiration create a compelling duality, though his "passionate indifference" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence but feels slightly rushed in bridging grief and technological chronicling. Pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (flagstones, brass fixtures) and the hall's eerie hum immerse the reader. Setting and object symbiosis is flawless.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (silent bell, automaton) and subtext about mourning and progress, but the council scene lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s, though "poignant levity" teeters on contrivance. Nuanced grief elevates it beyond AI tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the parade float timeframe feels underutilized. Lingers memorably on remembrance.</comment>
