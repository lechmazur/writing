<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ori's selective mutism and ventriloquism are vividly integrated into her character, revealing depth through her interactions with Vera and her obsessive weather archiving. Her motivation is clear but slightly overshadowed by the story's atmospheric focus.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is more atmospheric than action-driven, with a loose but coherent arc. Pacing is deliberate, though the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is richly evoked with sensory details, enhancing the story's dreamlike tone. The setting and object (coffee sleeve) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are used masterfully, and the ending is purposeful. The theme of redefining family is subtly layered but could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The emotional resonance is nuanced, and the style is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. It leaves a lingering impression, though the tight length slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
