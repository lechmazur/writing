<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brewer's detachment and feral elegance are compelling, but his motivation to escape dystopia feels slightly underdeveloped. The photo frame as a talisman works well, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the cassette's discovery, but the coded lullabies method feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned circus tent and analog-to-digital decay are vividly atmospheric. Hauntingly bright beams and sawdust dust enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (photo frame, cassette) and subtext (memory vs. dystopia) are rich. Ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of dystopia and circus surrealism. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the analog/digital conflict feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the lullabies method slightly disrupts momentum. Style is deliberate and evocative.</comment>
