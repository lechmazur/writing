<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rion's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "sadly joyful" grin and pocket knife reflecting his resilience. His bond with Mara adds depth, though his "underestimated" nature could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the transition from the haunted house to the courtyard feels slightly abrupt. The call-to-action device is effective but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (cracked mirrors, flickering lanterns). The ephemeral gloom tone enhances the atmosphere, though the wildflowers' sudden appearance slightly disrupts the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the knife, ramen as shared resistance) are well-used, and the ending is satisfying. However, some emotional beats ("hopeful despair") feel slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but phrases like "sadly joyful" verge on contrived. The pocket knife and ramen motifs are fresh, though the haunted house trope is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The theme of reclaiming wonder is compelling, though the resolution could linger more.</comment>
