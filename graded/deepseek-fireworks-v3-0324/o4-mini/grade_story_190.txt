<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlo's cautious yet impulsive nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to master empathy through stolen confessions is compelling. His actions align well with his traits, though his "enthusiastic apathy" could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Arlo's predictions, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships slightly underdeveloped. The ending feels purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center and its sterile, surreal atmosphere are richly evoked. Sensory details (the butterfly's shimmer, the painter's murmurs) deepen immersion, though the timeframe could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the butterfly, metaphors of drought) are masterfully employed. The story's emotional resonance and subtext about collective hope are striking, though the climax could linger longer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The tone avoids clich√©s, though "enthusiastic apathy" occasionally feels forced. The narrative avoids predictability and AI-like phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with haunting imagery. A few more thematic echoes could elevate it further.</comment>
