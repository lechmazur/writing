<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guarded minstrel's skepticism and credulous hope are well-balanced, driving his actions and growth. His transformation from doubt to belief is compelling, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the minstrel's mission, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions. The arc from skepticism to leadership is clear but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest is vividly rendered with luminous moss and microscopic trees, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details like "pollen-silk webs" immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in the bookmark, metaphor in the "angry peace") are strong, but the ending feels slightly abrupt. The theme of communal revival is resonant and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The nano-forest and decrypting vows are inventive, though some phrases ("angry peace") border on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope for cultural revival.</comment>
