<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is vividly portrayed, blending radical intent with fragile vulnerability. His actions align well with his guilt and desire for forgiveness, though his "distracted" nature could be more consistently woven into his behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hourglass and ribbon serving as potent symbols driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply layered story where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
