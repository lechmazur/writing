<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's unique perspective and the junior agent's raw confession reveal deep, nuanced character motivations, though the therapist's "many voices" could be more distinctly articulated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with the candle wax coding and charger plug symbolism driving a clear arc, though the "sound of hindsight" feels slightly underutilized as a structural device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (dripping wax, drone hum) and the austere setting amplify tension, though the facility's "glass atrium" feels abruptly introduced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful craft: layered symbolism (wax seals, charger plug), evocative subtext, and a resonant ending. Only minor nit: the "rueful triumph" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors (wax as coded fears), and nuanced emotion. Slight over-reliance on "merry bitterness" as a tonal refrain.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate; elements serve the story’s depth. Lingers on the transformative power of shared vulnerability, though the "bold discovery" tease feels slightly unresolved.</comment>
