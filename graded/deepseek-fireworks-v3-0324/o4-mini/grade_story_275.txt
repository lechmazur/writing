<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear and consistent, with his theoretically rebellious nature subtly revealed through his actions. His distinct voice and methodical approach to revival are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from barrenness to renewal. The comet's presence and the weathervane's role create logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crimson light, brittle petals) deepen the mood, and the setting perfectly supports the hermit's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (petals as glyphs, weathervane as compass) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of mindful resilience resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The hermit's nuanced rebellion and the orchard's revival feel uniquely crafted, though a few phrases border on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering hope that lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
