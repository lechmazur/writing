<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's "lukewarm" magic and peculiar loyalty are well-integrated, but his motivation to "paint a future free from fear" feels slightly abstract for such a short piece.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds to a clear climax, but the resolution feels rushed—the fog-formed silhouettes bowing is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar base and "charred serenity" create a haunting atmosphere, though the stage fog feels incongruously theatrical for the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doormat fragment, silhouettes) and evocative prose, but some metaphors verge on overworked ("ghostly heralds of hope and dread").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (lonely mage, cosmic battle). The "lukewarm" magic is a fresh twist, though.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity limits thematic depth. The ending lingers but doesn’t fully resonate.</comment>
