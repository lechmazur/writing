<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aloof inventor's transformation from detachment to defiant connection is compelling, though his initial halfheartedness could be more sharply contrasted with his later resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc from melancholy to defiance is coherent, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the transition from hesitation to resolve.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystalline library is vividly rendered, with luminescent orbs and fog-like nostalgia creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
