<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coin toss and secret mission driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with evocative sensory details (sunbaked petals, damp paper) enhancing the atmosphere. The workshop and mariner’s wheel are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (pressed flowers, compass rose) and emotional resonance elevate the storytelling. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "harmony with nature" borders on didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
