<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lucien's submissive yet perceptive nature is well-integrated, and his motivation to protect the creature is clear and consistent. His actions reveal depth, though his "earnest flippancy" could be more distinctly voiced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lucien's eavesdropping and countermeasure, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (chemical residue, echo chambers). The setting enhances the espionage-horticulture blend, though the "yard work" timeframe could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dull opener as precision tool) and subtext (empathy vs. bureaucracy). The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The hedge-witch-spy fusion is inventive, though some phrases verge on overly ornate ("molten ruin"). Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering impression of quiet defiance, though the "earnest flippancy" tone slightly clashes with the gravity of the stakes.</comment>
