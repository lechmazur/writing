<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is poetic but slightly abstract; his actions align well with his enigmatic purpose, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows with dreamlike coherence, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the transition from mission to rebirth. Cause and effect are subtly implied rather than explicit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details and baroque grandeur merge seamlessly with the assassin’s journey. The asteroid setting elevates the story’s surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose create profound subtext. The ending resonates, though the central conflict (assassin vs. purpose) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but a few phrases verge on over-poetic ("borrowed starlight" repeats). Nuanced emotion avoids cliché, though the spiderweb metaphor feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on fragility and renewal.</comment>
