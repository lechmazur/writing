<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Toren's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his lumberjack identity with healing pursuits. His "gracefully awkward" nature adds depth, though his "spirited" aspect could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the coded letter, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the latter half. The arc from discovery to resolution is satisfying but could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ossuary-restaurant setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's eerie, mystical tone. Sensory details (e.g., candlelight, repainted femurs) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bone marrow essences, nightmares) and subtext (exploitation vs. healing). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("harsh tenderness") feel slightly forced. The blending of healing and dystopian elements is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively combines elements. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection, though the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
