<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ambivalent prophet's duality is compelling, but his motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his traits, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts ("defragmenting the cosmos"). Pacing is strong, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's melancholic yet ambitious tone. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary devices elevate the narrative, but the emotional impact is muted by the protagonist's ambivalence. The ending is satisfying but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "bashful arrogance" occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, but the cosmic stakes overshadow the human scale. Leaves a lingering, if slightly opaque, impression.</comment>
