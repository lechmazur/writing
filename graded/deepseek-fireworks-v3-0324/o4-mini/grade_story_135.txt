<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rion's motivation is clear and compelling, blending academic and devotional drives. His actions consistently reflect his loyalty to preserving dialects, though his "peculiar faith" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Rion's quest, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The carnival poster twist is inventive but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are vividly rendered, with sensory details (steaming elixir, groaning wheels) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the straw, carnival as a "secret school") enrich the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The metal straw and carnival poster feel fresh, though the "peculiar faith" tone occasionally veers into vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy and resilience.</comment>
