<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The puppeteer's motivation is intriguing but his "irritatingly perfect" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with uncovering truth, but his distinct voice is muted by the dense prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the stamp album and gown, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the word limit strains the arc's completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's standout strengthâ€”sensory details (lantern flicker, mossy friezes) immerse the reader. The temple setting enhances the mystery but slightly overshadows the puppeteer's role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as "vanishing truths") and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the emotional payoff is muted by overwrought language. Theme of historical revelation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional purple prose ("symphonies of truth") and predictable mystery tropes. The puppeteer's nuance saves it from feeling entirely formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The ending lingers, though some imagery (e.g., "trembling temple") borders on excessive.</comment>
