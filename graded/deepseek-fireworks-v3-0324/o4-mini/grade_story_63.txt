<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's reserved yet purposeful nature is vividly portrayed, with her motivation to preserve art techniques clearly driving her actions. Her 'humbly proud' demeanor adds depth, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in connecting the ripple effect to the choir's crescendo. Cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The laboratory and choir practice meld beautifully, with sensory details (sound, touch) enriching the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the character's mission and the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolism (e.g., "frayed thread in a tapestry of sound") elevate the prose. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of preservation could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its approach, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It lingers in the mind, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
