<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The warrior's zealous nature and materially spiritual connection are compelling, but his internal conflict ("confusing certainty") could be more deeply explored to fully justify his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent and purposeful, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the revolution's culmination. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—stellar and corroded details merge seamlessly. The deck and nebulae enhance the revolution's ethereal yet grounded tension. Sensory immersion is vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (rust, ink, starlight) and subtext elevate the story. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overworked. Theme of silent rebellion is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal clichés. "Materially spiritual" and the nail's decay feel fresh. Some phrases border on ornate, but the core concept avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the warrior's vanishing could be more textured. A standout with minor refinements needed.</comment>
