<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with her porcelain fingers and expectantly resigned grace revealing depth. However, her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her mission, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending feels purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with golden beams and hollow gloom enhancing the ethereal tone. Sensory details like "light dripped" are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cane as conduit) and subtext (covenant of light/ruin). The ending lingers, though the conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("warped luminescence") edge toward purple prose. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Leaves a haunting, lingering question.</comment>
