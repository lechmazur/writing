<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is vividly clear, blending myth and machine seamlessly. His "patiently frantic" demeanor and defiance of chaos reveal depth, though his internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with lightning refraction as a brilliant metaphor for transformation. Pacing is masterful, though the storm's resolution borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionalâ€”quartz glyphs, carrion birds, and cobalt sky merge into a visceral, haunting atmosphere. The sky burial site elevates the action with grim majesty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bridle as talisman, prism as alchemy) and electric prose create lasting impact. The ending's thematic punch ("defiance transmutes fear") lingers powerfully.</comment>
