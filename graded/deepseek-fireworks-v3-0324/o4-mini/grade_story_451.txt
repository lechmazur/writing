<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but somewhat archetypal; the twins' desperation and the actors' longing for self-discovery add depth, though some reactions feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and propulsive, with a clear arc, but the tight word limit forces abrupt transitions (e.g., rogue actor's sudden betrayal).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—crystalline shadows, obsidian overhangs—but the farmers market feels underutilized as a contrast to the mountain's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baseball as temporal artifact) and thematic depth, though some metaphors verge on overworked ("heartbeat out of time").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on prophecy tropes, but occasional AI-like phrasing ("inscrutable inscription whispered hints") detracts slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the market's inclusion feels tangential. The ending lingers with poetic weight.</comment>
