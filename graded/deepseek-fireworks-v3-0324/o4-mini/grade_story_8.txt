<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noble's motivation is clear and consistent, blending empirical rebellion with a poetic mission to unite logic and madness. Their actions and 'voice' are distinct, though their dazed nature could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the chalked messages driving a coherent arc from curiosity to communal rebellion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dew-kissed stone, quivering chimes) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe harmonize perfectly with the noble's actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (e.g., "measure your madness in metronomes"), the story evokes wonder and reflection. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of logic/madness occasionally overshadows subtler layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("chalklike constellations"), but the rebellion's authenticity and nuanced emotion elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, lyrical whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the boundaries of creativity and tradition.</comment>
