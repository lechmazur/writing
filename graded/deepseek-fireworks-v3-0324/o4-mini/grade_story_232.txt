<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The physician's motivation is clear but her backstory feels underexplored; her "bleary-eyed" state and connection to the cutlass hint at depth, but more nuance would elevate her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and paced well, with a clear arc from discovery to portal, though the digital nomad camp feels underutilized as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, blending sensory details (seaweed, coffee grounds) with mood ("dire enchantment"), though the camp's modernity clashes slightly with the mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coffee as maps, cutlass as key) and evocative prose, but the ending's thematic weight ("doorways") slightly overreaches its setup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending tech and myth, but some phrases ("sunken hope," "fevered dreams") edge toward clich√©; the cutlass's enchantment feels fresher.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tight word count, though the nomad camp feels tacked on; the story lingers with thematic resonance but lacks polish in integration.</comment>
