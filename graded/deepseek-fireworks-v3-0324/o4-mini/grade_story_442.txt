<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tradesman's edgy, pessimistic nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to reclaim memory is clear and compelling. His actions align well with his traits, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the windmill's rotation and synchronized watches driving the narrative. The arc feels complete, though the transition into the void could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mushroom house and phosphorescent spores create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (damp shadow, creaking windmill) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (candle, watches) and subtext about memory. The ending is purposeful, and the prose is lyrical without being overwrought. A standout in craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "vectorize" metaphor is fresh, and the tone is consistent. Minor quibble: "comfortingly pessimistic" feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
