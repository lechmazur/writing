<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent, with his feisty nature and pride driving his actions. His use of the grimoire and reaction to youthify reveal depth, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the bridge collapse feels abrupt. The youthify charm ties the arc together neatly, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Amazonian treehouse city is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the misty dusk enhances the magical tone. The setting amplifies the stakes but could integrate more with the specter's arrival.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and subtext (youth vs. responsibility), though the ending’s emotional impact is slightly diluted by Arlo’s rapid shift back to pride. The theme is clear but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The grimoire and youthify twist stand out, though the "playful cynicism" tone occasionally feels forced. Nuanced handling of emotion elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about Arlo’s growth. A few tighter transitions would perfect it.</comment>
