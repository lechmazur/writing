<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clandestine watchman's motivation to defy finality is compelling, but his "analytically free" attribute could be more deeply explored to justify his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the briefcase's braille-like bumps and goggles driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s theme of defiance. Leaves a lingering sense of boundless possibility.</comment>
