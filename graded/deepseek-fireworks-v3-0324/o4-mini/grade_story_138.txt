<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noble's motivations and actions are vividly portrayed, with his struggle against illusions and his use of the drone revealing depth. However, his "hollow recklessness" could be more consistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the noble's actions, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending resolves well, though the middle feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details like "ozone and regret" enhancing mood. The setting and object (drone) are meaningfully connected, though the timeframe ("between text messages") feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ticket stubs, drone) and subtext (mortality, lineage). The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overworked. Emotional resonance is achieved, though not consistently.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors ("occult mosaic"). The style is distinctive, though a few phrases ("hollow recklessness") feel forced. Nuanced handling of emotion elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about truth and memory. Minor stylistic hiccups prevent perfection.</comment>
