<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's "eagerly unwilling" attribute is well-integrated, revealing a nuanced internal conflict. His motivation to restore the carousel is clear but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the tapestry discovery, but the transition from storm chaser to carousel restorer feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and desert storm contrasts are evocative, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (wind, stitching) are used effectively to immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tongs, tapestry) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of inner strength could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("nostalgic innovation") feel slightly overworked. The emotional nuance is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the storm chaser element feels slightly detached from the carousel focus. The length feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
