<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's obsession is vividly portrayed, driving his actions with a clear, singular motivation. His distinct 'voice' emerges through his meticulous, almost ritualistic rewriting of diaries.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from obsession to resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect relationships (key ring, rewriting, liberation) are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (flickering lanterns, hushed whispers) enhancing the eerie setting. The whisper collection point feels integral to the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (brass key ring, fading ink) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is deeply satisfying, with a resonant theme of reconciliation and liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply imaginative story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and thematic depth.</comment>
