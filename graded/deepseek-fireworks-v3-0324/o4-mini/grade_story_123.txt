<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and her paradoxical nature ("gleefully morose") adds depth, though her "eager brewer" role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the brevity slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with vivid sensory details (oil, mildew, ozone) and a hauntingly evocative setting that enhances the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open to interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
