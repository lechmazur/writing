<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vallis is a compelling paradox—her scholarly calm contrasts sharply with her assassin’s heart, and her motivation to reshape the world is clear yet haunted by regret. The rubber key cover serves as a subtle but powerful symbol of her dual role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the cyclical nightmares driving both character and narrative forward. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly truncates the sense of a full arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The station’s humming consoles and fractured harmonics create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (incense smoke, rubber sheath) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies Vallis’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices—mournful elation as a motif, the rubber key cover as symbolism—the story lingers in the mind. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of using horror as a guide is hauntingly original.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (smoke like spectral tendrils) and nuanced emotion elevate this beyond cliché. The voice is distinct, though some phrases edge toward over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story leaves a resonant question: Can pain forge peace?</comment>
