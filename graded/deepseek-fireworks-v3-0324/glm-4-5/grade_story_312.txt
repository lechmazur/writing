<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's agoraphobia and inherited burdens are deeply woven into his actions and decisions, lending authenticity and emotional weight to his transformation. His "voice" is distinct, though some internal logic could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the rain-rhythm method feels slightly contrived. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the snuffbox's magic lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and desert rain create a rich, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's themes. Sensory details (sound, touch) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (snuffbox, dunes) and subtext (inheritance vs. self-determination). The ending is satisfying, though the "rewriting destiny" concept could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original handling of agoraphobia and inherited trauma avoids clich√©s. The prose is polished but occasionally leans toward over-poetic abstraction. Emotion is nuanced, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically resonant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. A few contrivances hold it back from perfection.</comment>
