<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and evolves naturally. Her use of the coathanger as an antenna and her reactions to debris patterns reveal a distinct, nuanced character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds toward a satisfying arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of her transformation from unease to determination.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orbital station setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (liquid spill, postcard rustle) deepen immersion and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (coathanger as connection) and subtext (redemption through patterns). The ending resonates, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. Elara's methods and the cosmic debris theme feel fresh, though "universal whispers" edges toward poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. The brief length works, but deeper exploration of the brother's disappearance would heighten impact.</comment>
