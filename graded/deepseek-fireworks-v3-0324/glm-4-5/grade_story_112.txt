<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'aimless' trait feels slightly underdeveloped in contrast to their sudden purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with the hopscotch discovery providing a clever pivot, though the transition to "grill the curator" is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (snowflake, handkerchief) enhancing the archiveâ€™s mystique. The hush/snowflake motif is slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and subtext, though the "mournful elation" repetition borders on telling. Ending is satisfying but leans sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but the "seeds of vigilance" metaphor feels strained. Some phrases ("factually imaginative") verge on overly precious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The hopscotch twist elevates it beyond a mere preservation parable.</comment>
