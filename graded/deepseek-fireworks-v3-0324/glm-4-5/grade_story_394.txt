<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is compelling, though her "aimlessly passionate" nature could be more deeply explored. Her use of the bent fork is original, but her transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the leaf-pattern method feels underdeveloped. Pacing is tight yet effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with strong sensory details. The colosseum and amusement park contrast beautifully, though the paper airplane connection is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance, but the theme of "dangerous knowledge" could be more nuanced. Ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and stylistically fresh, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Avoids clich√©s but could delve deeper into the archer's emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The bent fork and legacy of compassion stand out as particularly compelling.</comment>
