<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, though her "sly" nature could be more pronounced in her actions. The tarnished fork as a key to her discovery adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the resolution. The connection between folklore and disappearances is intriguing but could be more sharply revealed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like the rusted bumper cars and broken roof grounding the story in place.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (fork as key) and a thematic exploration of cultural preservation. The ending feels purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original blending of folklore and mystery, though "desperate optimism" as a tone feels slightly forced. The prose avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the family volunteering tradition feels underutilized. The length suits the story, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
