<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and compelling, blending rebellion with intellectual curiosity. His actions align well with his empirically rebellious nature, though his nobility feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Alistair's defiance to his confrontation. However, the resolution with authorities feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and themes. Sensory details (chimes, chalk strokes) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chalk as rebellion) and subtext (challenging dogma). The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue (absent here) could deepen character interaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of knowledge.</comment>
