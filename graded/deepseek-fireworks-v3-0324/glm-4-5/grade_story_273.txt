<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Elric's motivations are clear and deeply intertwined with his "strangely honest" disposition. His defiance against cosmic authorities is consistent with his role as a chronicler of the forgotten.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with every action (subjugation, preservation through wine bottles) driving toward a cohesive resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense narrative that wears its constraints lightly. Leaves a lasting impression of quiet rebellion.</comment>
