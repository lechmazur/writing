<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's nostalgic yet purpose-driven nature is compelling, though its "anxiously fearless" attribute could be more deeply explored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the crystals' threat and the telescope's role creating a cohesive cause-and-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi and melancholy, avoiding tropes. "Brazen modesty" is a fresh descriptor, though some phrasing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of sacrifice and legacy.</comment>
