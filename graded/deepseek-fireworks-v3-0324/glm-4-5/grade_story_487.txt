<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The docile bruiser's disturbingly calm demeanor and brash tenderness create a compelling contrast, and his motivation is clear and consistent. His gentle yet methodical actions reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The twist is well-executed, though the map-piecing method feels slightly underdeveloped given its pivotal role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with potent sensory details (drum solos, carnivorous plants). The setting enhances the story's tension and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (baton as translator) and subtext (myth vs. reality). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates all elements, leaving a lingering thematic impact. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
