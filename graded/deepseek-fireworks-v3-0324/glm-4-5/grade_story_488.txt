<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear, and his actions align with his desire to surpass his past self. The blend of quantum mechanics and ancestral magic gives him a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the quantum beach and demolition timeframe enhancing tension. Pacing is effective, though the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum beach and condemned building create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "particles of possibility") are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices like the leaf map's symbolism are strong, and the ending is satisfying. The conflict (outshining his reflection) is introduced and resolved deftly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of quantum theory and magic. No clich√©s, and metaphors ("corroded rapture") are fresh. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the narrative, and the length suits its ambition. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of invention.</comment>
