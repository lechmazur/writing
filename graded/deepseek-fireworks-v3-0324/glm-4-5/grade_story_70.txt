<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bartholomew's transformation from rigid to empathetic is compelling and well-executed, but his "certainly uncertain" attribute could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, though the adhesive analysis feels like a forced inclusion. The arc from curiosity to revelation is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The greenhouse and gravestones create a haunting yet fertile contrast, enhancing the theme of transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (Tesla bulb as empathy, gravestones as past rigidity) elevates the story. The ending is resonant, though the adhesive method slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, but some phrases verge on overly poetic. The Tesla bulb concept is fresh, though the scribe trope is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the short length feeling deliberate. The story lingers due to its thematic depth and evocative prose.</comment>
