<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's trickster lawyer background is compelling, but his motivation could be sharper. The gift tag adds depth, but his "impatiently patient" trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tense, with clear cause-and-effect, though the pacing near the end feels rushed. The cryptic dares drive tension but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The biodome's contrast with the wasteland elevates the atmosphere, though the stretching timeframe feels minor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gift tag, algae pond) and subtext (linguistic genocide). Ending is purposeful but could linger more. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on clich√© ("corporate overlords"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements mesh well, and the length feels deliberate. The story leaves a haunting question about resistance, though the "chosen paths" theme could be richer.</comment>
