<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The baker's motivation is vividly clear, and his cynically gentle nature adds depth. His actions align well with his revolutionary intent, though some nuance could sharpen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the baker's mission, but the time machine element feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution slightly rushes the revolution's climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered with sensory details (flour, flowers) and mystical undertones. The garage clashes tonally but the town's oppression is palpable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (flowers, moon) is potent, and the theme of quiet resistance resonates. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending revolution with baking, but "shadows speaking" leans tropey. Language avoids purple prose, and emotional depth feels genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite the garage's oddity. The brevity serves the story, leaving a lingering hope. Creative fusion of mundane and magical.</comment>
