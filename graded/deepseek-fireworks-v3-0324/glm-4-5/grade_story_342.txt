<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The careless pilot’s transformation into a determined liberator is compelling, though his initial carelessness could be more vividly established to contrast his growth.

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to emancipation.

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (shifting doodles, glowing glove) enrich the narrative, and the theme of liberation resonates.
