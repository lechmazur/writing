<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The herbalist's motivation and traits are vividly portrayed, with her exhaustion and obsession creating a compelling arc. Her "thoughtfully thoughtless" nature is well-integrated, though her sudden shift toward openness feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the goose's flight path serving as an elegant catalyst for resolution. The tight word limit is expertly navigated, though the climax's rapid insight could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting is immersive and thematically resonant, with sensory details (ocean tides, golden light) deepening atmosphere. The glass walls metaphorically mirror the herbalist's isolation and eventual clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (goose, bellows) and subtext (perfection vs. openness). The ending is poignant and thematically rich, though the herbalist's epiphany could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (goose as teacher) and nuanced emotion elevate the story. Minimal clich√©s, though "price of perfection" borders on familiar. The prose avoids floridity while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on balance. Only minor tightening of the herbalist's arc would improve it further.</comment>
