<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wanderer's stoicism and motivation are well-integrated, though his "brash tenderness" could be more deeply explored to avoid slight tonal inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect, though the urgency of "imposing" could be sharper to heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and symbiotic with the ritual's stakes; the "mesmerizingly bland" floorboard is a standout detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in premise and execution, though "necessary lies" leans toward familiar tropes without full subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Lingers but lacks a final punch.</comment>
