<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and compelling, blending duty with personal quest. His "overzealous" nature is subtly shown through meticulous note-taking and patrolling, but deeper layers of inherited purpose could be explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each encounter escalating stakes logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly original and atmospheric, with sensory details (petals, artificial moonlight) enhancing the dreamlike tone. The overpass-orchard dichotomy is brilliantly exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (notebook, symbols) and subtext (dreams as lost divinity) are masterfully layered. The ending resonates thematically, though the goddess's echo could be more viscerally felt earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original premise and fresh metaphors (e.g., "constellations that once guided dreamers"). Minor over-reliance on "fluctuate" and "echo" slightly dampens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale where elements serve the story elegantly. The brevity amplifies its mythic quality, leaving a lingering question about dreams' return.</comment>
