<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blunt heretic nature and motivation are clear, but her emotional depth could be richer. The teddy bear ties in well but feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the stock ticker's role could be more organically integrated. The resolution is satisfying.</comment>
