<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation and analytical freedom are well-integrated, though deeper exploration of his past or 'voice' would elevate the character further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful pacing with a clear arc. The briefcase's decoding drives the plot elegantly, though the 'final bow' connection feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—rust, shadows, and forgotten machinery reinforce themes of continuance. Sensory details (e.g., braille-like bumps) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (goggles, briefcase) and layered subtext about cyclicality. Ending resonates, though the 'prickly wonder' tone occasionally overrides nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("braille-like bumps" repeated), but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative interplay between wilderness wisdom and defiance of finality. Leaves a lingering thematic impression.</comment>
