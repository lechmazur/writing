<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and consistent, and his eccentric persona shines through, though his "reliably unreliable" attribute could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically but the tight word limit makes the resolution feel slightly abrupt. Pacing is otherwise well-managed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story leans slightly too hard on its premise rather than organic narrative momentum.</comment>
