<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zephyr's boredom and shapeshifting abilities are well-integrated, but the "intelligently foolish" trait could be more deeply explored to fully justify their bold actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clever, unexpected method driving the overthrow. The brevity works in its favor, though the taxi ride’s execution could feel slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and post-imperial decay create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., rain, figurine's hum) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (figurine, storm) and subtext (stagnation vs. change) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "measured wildness" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Some phrases edge toward over-formality, but the voice is distinct and the concept inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story thrives within its constraints, weaving elements cohesively. Leaves a lingering question about power and disruption.</comment>
