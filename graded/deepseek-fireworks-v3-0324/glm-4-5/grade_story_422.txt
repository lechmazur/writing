<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ventriloquist's selective mutism and optimism are compellingly integrated, and his communication through Charlie reveals deep emotional layers. His motivations and actions are consistent and poignant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from weather obsession to human connections, though the parallel universe beach feels underutilized. Pacing is tight yet satisfying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "patterns of light that defied physics"). Avoids clich√©s, though euphoric agitation feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with minor quibbles about parallel universe execution. Leaves a lingering warmth about found family.</comment>
