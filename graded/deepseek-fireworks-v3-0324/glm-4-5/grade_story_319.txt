<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his transformation, though his "frail" nature could be more vividly shown through actions earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the rapid resolution of transformation slightly undermines tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (salt-tinged air, iridescent phial) amplifying the mood. The tidal island feels alive and oppressive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (faded allegiances, phial's glow) and emotional depth, but the ending's hopeful melancholy could be more subtly woven into earlier passages.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and evocative; avoids clich√©s. The alchemy phial and tree-bark messages feel fresh, though "resolutely wavering" borders on contradictory phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the tidal island and phial driving the narrative. Brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
