<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "random" nature feels slightly underdeveloped. His ethical ambiguity and cosmic ambition are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The knitting-as-magic method is inventive, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jazz age time capsule and sensory details (amber light, gin scent) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The mug and gloves are integrated seamlessly into the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's impact could be sharper. The theme of perceptual manipulation is thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("cosmic wonder") verge on overused. The tone balances numbness and fascination well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax. Leaves a lingering unease about perception.</comment>
