<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thomas's grief and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his notebooks and silent bell reinforcing his character. His "passionately indifferent" attitude adds depth, though the latter could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Thomas's mission to uncover the truth driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the cave-in backstory provides clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The secret society hall and fading parade float create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (coal dust, faulty wiring) immerse the reader, enhancing the mood of progress shadowed by loss.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the bell, nightmares as clues) and a layered theme of progress's human cost elevate the story. The ending is poignant and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("progress without compassion was merely a different kind of cave-in"). Minor stiffness in "passionately indifferent" slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, questioning the ethics of technological advancement.</comment>
