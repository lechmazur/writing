<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his existential discontent, but his "scrappy tavern-hand" persona feels underutilized in the context of his transcendent transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the shells' mystery driving the narrative forward. The resolution feels earned, though the riverbed method's logic stretches coherence slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden and backward-flowing sands create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., shells glowing like sunsets) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shells as fragmented memory, the garden as programmed reality) elevates the story. The ending delivers emotional and thematic resonance with minimal exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise, though "predictably unpredictable" leans slightly tropey. The prose avoids purple flourishes, but "flippant solemnity" isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively into a meditation on rebellion against artificial order. The length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with lingering wonder.</comment>
