<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The serene fisher's motivation and backstory are subtly woven into the narrative, revealing depth through actions rather than exposition. His transformation from magician's apprentice to fisher adds nuance, though his "serene" nature could be more dynamically challenged.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s progression—from the lullaby’s hush to the quilt’s unraveling—is tightly structured, with each action logically leading to the next. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (butterflies) risks feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse for extinct plants is a masterstroke, blending atmosphere with thematic resonance. Sensory details (humidity, glowing wristband) immerse the reader, and the setting actively shapes the quest’s stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (quilt as knowledge, illusion as truth) elevates the narrative. The ending’s ambiguity—butterflies carrying fragments—invites reflection. Only minor flaw: the wristband’s restoration feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the quilt’s unraveling as method and the greenhouse’s role. Some phrases ("logically absurd tradition") verge on overwrought, but the voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the greenhouse and quilt serving the theme of hidden truths. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions about the fisher’s future.</comment>
