<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's bluffing swindler persona and energetically lethargic demeanor are well-integrated into his actions and motivation. His hidden investigation aligns with his deceptive exterior, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the resolution. The dropped book meet-cute feels contrived, though the pacing otherwise manages the word limit well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed skyscraper orchard is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details (wind, rustling leaves) deepen immersion, though the computer restart feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (blank price tag) and thematic depth (corporate exploitation). The ending satisfies, but "gentle harshness" tone isn't fully realized in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and premise, but some phrases ("invisible allies") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the meet-cute lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative use of constraints. Leaves a lingering impact, though the climax feels slightly compressed.</comment>
