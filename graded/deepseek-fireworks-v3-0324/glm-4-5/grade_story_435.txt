<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear, but her background as a professional dream interpreter feels underutilized. Her actions align with her motivation, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the vapor facility and the Stone Archives feels tenuous. The ending is satisfying but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory details, but the vapor facility's role in the broader world isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (calcified hands, stone laws) is effective, but the story leans too heavily on telling rather than showing Elena's faith. The theme is thought-provoking but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("quiet pulse," "peculiar faith"). The premise avoids clich√©s, but execution could be fresher.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its length. The ending lingers, but deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
