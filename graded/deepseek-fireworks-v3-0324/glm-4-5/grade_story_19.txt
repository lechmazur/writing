<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vividly clear and deeply integrated with the balance scale ritual; her "feral" nature could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s tight arc—from the newborn’s cry to the ranger’s epiphany—is flawlessly paced and resolved, though the code words feel underdeveloped as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dandelion field and fading light create a transcendent atmosphere; sensory details (seeds, wind) are exquisite and thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal clichés, though "embrace the unknown" borders on familiarity. Metaphors (seed/stone) feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements; only the code words slightly disrupt the story’s otherwise organic flow.</comment>
