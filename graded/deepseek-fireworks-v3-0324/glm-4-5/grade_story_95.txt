<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brother Thomas is vividly portrayed with a clear, consistent motivation, but his "timidly loud" attribute could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by his linguistic quest, though the storm chasing setting feels underutilized for narrative propulsion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm headquarters and ancient artifacts create a rich, evocative atmosphere, but the "eons of silent wonder" timeframe is more poetic than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the endingâ€™s emotional payoff could be sharper. The "forgotten dance" motif is compelling but slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Authentic and original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Minor reliance on poetic abstraction ("tempest in his mind") detracts slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, though the storm chasing element feels secondary. The brevity works in its favor, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
