<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the sheriff's 'voice' could be more distinct. The playing card as a symbol is effectively used to reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The chance encounter drives the plot well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, though the lava lamp meditation room feels slightly jarring in contrast to the rest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the dialogue (if present) is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the sheriff's introspection, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("world-weary"). Emotional nuance is handled well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering reflection on freedom and acceptance.</comment>
