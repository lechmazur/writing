<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The nomadic dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "ferociously polite" demeanor feels somewhat underdeveloped. The mariner's wheel and her mission add depth, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The intervention and coin toss drive the narrative, though the secret mission element feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flower pressing workshop and its atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. The setting and objects (mariner’s wheel, pressed flowers) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors ("anguished joy") feel forced. Themes of harmony and fate are well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows originality, but some phrasing ("ferociously polite") leans toward artificiality. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. The length suits the tale, leaving a lingering sense of harmony and completion.</comment>
