<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jasper’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'unusually normal' demeanor could be more explicitly tied to his actions. The empty tape dispenser is a strong, tangible symbol of his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The ghostly interrogations drive the narrative well, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (rusted equipment, withered crops) enhancing atmosphere. The gray sky and ghosts deepen the desolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tape dispenser) and subtext (guilt, redemption). The ending is purposeful, though the spectral dialogue occasionally feels overly expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("taunt the jaws of defeat"). Avoids clichés, but the ghostly interrogations could feel contrived if not for Jasper’s layered remorse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, with the tape dispenser and ghosts adding depth. The length feels deliberate, but the resolution could linger more.</comment>
