<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her cosmic powers add depth, but her "academically wild" trait feels underdeveloped in the tight narrative. Her actions align well with her hidden identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, with the ritual serving as a strong climax. Pacing is effective, though the transition from factory to terrace could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse. The brooch's connection to the setting is compelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brooch, abyss) and a resonant theme of self-acceptance. The ending is satisfying, though the cosmic elements occasionally verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "ordered disarray" of thoughts). Avoids AI tropes, but the cosmic power trope is familiar. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are well-integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of transformation, though the factory setting could be more vivid.</comment>
