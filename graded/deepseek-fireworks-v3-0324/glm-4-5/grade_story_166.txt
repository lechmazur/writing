<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "solemnly silly" determination adding a unique charm. His use of the straw reveals ingenuity, though his spectral nature could be explored more deeply.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the perforation ritual driving the story effectively. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the forbidden logs could be more integral to the tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, paradoxical atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "morning mist on warm waters") immerse the reader, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (straw as a key) and subtext (bridging worlds). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of communication could be more layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the "last wish" backdrop feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
