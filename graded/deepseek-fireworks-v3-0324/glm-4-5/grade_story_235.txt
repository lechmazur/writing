<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but verges on romantic clich√©; the herbalist's distinct voice and actions are compelling, though her tragic love backstory could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically with a satisfying arc, though the meteor shower revelation's timing feels slightly contrived. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "long-lost love" trope lacks subversion. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's poetic core. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic connection.</comment>
