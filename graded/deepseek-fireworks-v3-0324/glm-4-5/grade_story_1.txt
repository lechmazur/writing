<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'stunt double' profession feels slightly forced in the context of the story's spiritual undertones.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the garage sale framing feels tangential. The pyramid discovery and knot-unraveling resolution are well-structured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The pyramid setting and spiritual tone harmonize effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending leans slightly toward clich√©. Emotional resonance is achieved but not deeply lingering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept, though some phrasing feels slightly robotic. The net metaphor is fresh, but the stunt double premise lacks full authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, but the garage sales element detracts slightly from the pyramid's mystique. Creative integration of most assigned elements.</comment>
