<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's grumpy but noble demeanor is consistent and drives his actions; motivation is clear but could delve deeper into his reluctance-to-purpose transition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause-effect, but the overheard conversation feels slightly contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent, with sensory details enhancing the polluted yet mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (beetle, water wisdom) and emotional resonance, though the theme of reluctant leadership could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on "grumpy redeemer" trope. Some phrases verge on generic (e.g., "heart heavy with responsibility").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the carnival feels underutilized. Length suits the arc, though deeper thematic exploration is possible.</comment>
