<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and internal conflict are clear and well-developed. The amber brooch effectively symbolizes her connection to tradition, and her "rationally rebellious" nature adds depth to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit. The workshop scene resolves the tension while leaving room for future stakes. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details ("coastal fog," "sunset paint the chalk cliffs") reinforcing the mood. The colony's creative energy contrasts effectively with the "cheerful gloom."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance—tradition vs. modernity—supported by symbolism (brooch, pigments). Ending is purposeful, though some emotional beats could be less explicit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on predictable "tradition-preserver" tropes. Language avoids purple prose, though some descriptors ("cheerful gloom") risk overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though deeper subtext could elevate it further.</comment>
