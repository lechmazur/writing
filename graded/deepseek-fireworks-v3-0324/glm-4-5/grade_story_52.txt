<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and character arc are well-realized, with her transition from pickpocket to resistance symbol feeling organic and compelling. The brother's imprisonment adds emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but slightly rushed; the karaoke duet feels abrupt, though it serves the thematic payoff. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hourglass marketplace is vividly rendered, and the fading chalk lines subtly reinforce the theme of cyclical oppression. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pencil sharpener, hourglass) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the karaoke device slightly strains believability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on resistance and time.</comment>
