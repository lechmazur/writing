<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apothecary's guarded yet whimsical nature is well-developed, and her motivation to preserve ancient wisdom is clear and consistent. Her use of the seashell and amulet reveals depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the apothecary's goal, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The power plant setting enhances the eerie, abandoned atmosphere, and sensory details (rusted turbines, humming amulet) are evocative. The seashell and setting connection is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used well, and the theme of rediscovering lost wisdom resonates. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional impact is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "hum of humility" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of emotion, though some descriptions verge on overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and creatively combined. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about wisdom and progress.</comment>
