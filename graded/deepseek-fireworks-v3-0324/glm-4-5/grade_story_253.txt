<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bandit's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, but his "polite" nature feels underdeveloped. His transformation is compelling but could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the harp's role feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though some cause-and-effect relationships lack depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid and immersive, but the "electronic wilderness" and harp clash tonally. Sensory details enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the ending is satisfying. However, the theme of redemption could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases feel overly ornate. The story avoids clich√©s but occasionally slips into predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but some elements feel slightly forced. The length works, though a few ideas need tighter integration.</comment>
