<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending past trauma with present mission. However, the 'carefree gambler' aspect feels slightly underdeveloped in contrast to his deeper layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the connection between the blueprint and island memories could be tighter. Pacing is strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (salt scent, sun-baked sand) enhancing the workshop's contrast. Setting and mood are expertly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (blueprint as fragmented past) and subtext. Ending is purposeful, though the emotional payoff could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on formulaic ("hammered repose"). Emotion is shown well, though a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Length feels intentional, leaving room for lingering questions.</comment>
