<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into her actions, though her hive-mind therapist role could use more exploration to fully distinguish her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the wax-dripping method is inventive but feels underdeveloped in its connection to the broader narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, introspective mood. The facility's blend of tech and artifacts is particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wax as collective regret) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be deepened.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but some phrasing leans toward the overly poetic. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels stylistically uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the word limit constrains fuller exploration. Leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly transformative.</comment>
