<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The smiling saboteur's motivation is clear and consistently tied to her cosmic fury, but her "smile" feels slightly overused, detracting from deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect logic is strong, and the ritual's progression feels organic, though the mannequins' sudden sentience could be better foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—rusted towers, the gorge's depth, and flickering light create a vivid, immersive world that amplifies the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext (imperfection as power), though the climax's "whispered incantations" verge on cliché. The ending resonates deeply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where elements serve the story’s theme, though the mannequins' role borders on whimsical for the tone.</comment>
