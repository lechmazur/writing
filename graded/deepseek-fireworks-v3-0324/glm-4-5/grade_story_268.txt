<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, but subtlety in "subdued" nature could be deepened. The wooden bead and mirror tracking reveal intriguing layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight arc with logical cause-effect, but virtual calls slightly disrupt pacing. Resolution feels earned though abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (bead's pulse, mirror distortions) excel. "Screaming silence" and abandoned setting amplify atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well; brevity feels intentional. Lingering question about "futures he might not change" elevates it.</comment>
