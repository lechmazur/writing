<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but the "hesitant raider" archetype feels slightly underdeveloped. The mug's symbolic role is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from speakeasy to talent show feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering impression of healing and unity.</comment>
