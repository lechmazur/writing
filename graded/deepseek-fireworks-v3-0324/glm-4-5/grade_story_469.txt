<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to his daughter's memory. His logically emotional nature adds nuance but could be more consistently explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the climax. Overreach as an action is well-utilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and garden scent create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are exceptional, though the timeframe could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (necklace) and subtext, but the ending's "grandiose modesty" slightly undercuts emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors, but the "blameless smuggler" label feels underexplored. Avoids clich√©s but could lean further into uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are well-integrated, but the tight word limit strains thematic depth. Leaves a lingering question about the tunnels' significance.</comment>
