<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending moral ambiguity with a distinct personal code. The "innocently guilty" attribute adds depth, though her "code of instinct" could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with clues driving momentum. The scavenger hunt structure elevates tension, though the skateboarding motif occasionally feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with "dusty starlight" and museum details enhancing the dreamlike tension. The contrast between silence and skateboarding noise is especially effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (serpent symbol, poisoned rapier) enrich subtext. Ending is satisfying but slightly rushed; the moral ambiguity lingers compellingly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s, though "code of instinct" leans abstract. Sensory details (cool hilt, music box melody) feel fresh and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the rapier and poisoner's morality as standout anchors. Length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
