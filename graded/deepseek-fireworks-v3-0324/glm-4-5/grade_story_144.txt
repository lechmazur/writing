<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and well-integrated, but his backstory feels slightly rushed. His 'voice' as a chef-diplomat is distinct, though more introspection could deepen his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The music box's tuning as climax is elegant, though the street fair setup could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—haunted flume and muted lullabies merge seamlessly with the interdimensional tension. Sensory details (water-soaked tunnels, shimmering Zephyrians) are vivid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clichés, but "cradle of hope" leans slightly generic. Style is purposeful, though some descriptors ("calm frenzy") feel overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite constraints. Lingers with thematic weight—how small acts bridge divides.</comment>
