<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is intriguing but somewhat vague; her "indifferent enthusiasm" feels inconsistently portrayed. Her actions align with her role, but her voice lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; the ritual's mechanics are underexplored. Pacing struggles within the word limit, though coherence holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest assetâ€”evocative sensory details and setting enhance the eerie mood. The abandoned mess hall and music hall echo effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memorable premise with solid symbolism (receipt as a temporal artifact). Ending is satisfying, but some devices (e.g., "quietly loud") feel overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality suffers from AI-ish phrasing (e.g., "indifferent enthusiasm" repeated). Some tropes (rituals, digital ghosts) lack fresh subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under thematic ambition. Length feels limiting; creativity shines in blending digital/physical realms.</comment>
