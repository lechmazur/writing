<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The boastful warrior's arc from delusion to self-awareness is compelling and well-executed, though his transition could benefit from slightly more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic and cause-effect relationships hold together tightly, but the word limit slightly truncates the climax's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasp nest's bioluminescent, pulsating atmosphere is vividly immersive and perfectly mirrors the warrior's psychological imprisonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("lint-filled pocket" as a map of authenticity), though the "precise madness" tone occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich microcosm where every element serves the narrativeâ€™s existential core. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
