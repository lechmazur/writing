<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dr. Reed's motivation is clear but her "pleasant meddler" trait feels underdeveloped. Her manipulative nature is hinted at but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and intriguing, though the connection between the skates and symbols could be tighter. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward create a striking contrast with the beach wanderer mystery. Atmosphere is immersive and supports the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skates as tools for carving symbols) and a memorable ending. The theme of tracing backward for answers is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The ice skates as a key to the mystery are inventive. No overt AI tells in prose or structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The elements cohere well, and the story feels deliberate rather than constrained. Leaves a lingering sense of unsettling discovery.</comment>
