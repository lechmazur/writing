<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's cynically hopeful nature is well-integrated, and his motivation is clear, but his modern background feels underexplored in shaping his actions beyond surface-level rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the speed dating event as a rebellion cover feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details ("charred serenity," "wind howling through the broken dome").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (herbs as hope) and a resonant theme, though the ending leans slightly toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise but some phrases ("cynically hopeful") feel overused. Avoids clich√©s but could lean further into nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels intentional, though the speed dating method slightly undermines gravity.</comment>
