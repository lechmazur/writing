<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His 'frantic peace' is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the temporal mechanics could be sharper. The diary discovery feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch’s garage and half-lit corridor create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., shimmering seashell) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seashell, carpet) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, though the academic redemption feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clichés, but the scholar’s exile could be more nuanced. The seashell’s role is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the witch’s garage could be more integral.</comment>
