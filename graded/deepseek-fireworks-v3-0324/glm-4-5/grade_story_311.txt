<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with strong alignment between actions and established traits. The faded photograph effectively reveals depth, though "serendipitously stubborn" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause-and-effect, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The lunar greenhouse setting ties well to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is evocative and enhances mood, though the "park visits" timeframe feels underutilized. Sensory details (low-gravity photograph tear) are standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the "timely rebirth" concept isn't fully earned. Ending is purposeful, though the theme of liberation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s, but "serene anger" and "serendipitously stubborn" verge on overwriting. Originality shines in the hybrid-lunar metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the word limit strains thematic depth. The lunar setting elevates what could otherwise feel like a familiar liberation arc.</comment>
