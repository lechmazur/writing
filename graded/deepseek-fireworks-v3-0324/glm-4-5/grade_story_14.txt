<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is vividly clear, and his transformation through the candle mold and lectures adds depth. His "voice" is distinct, though some reactions could feel more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively, but the midnight lectures slightly disrupt pacing. The arc from despair to realization is well-executed within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Superb atmosphere—the station and candlelit dinners amplify the theme. Sensory details (waves, flickering light) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (candle mold, tides) and emotional resonance, though the ending leans slightly didactic. Subtext about cosmic debts is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but the professors' dialogue borders on theatrical. Nuanced handling of "laughing tears" elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate well, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the gamble of life, though some concepts could be sharper.</comment>
