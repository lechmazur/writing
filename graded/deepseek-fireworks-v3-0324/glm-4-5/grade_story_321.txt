<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with the object and setting. His "almost radical" plan and internal conflict are compelling. However, his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly structured, with a clear arc. The hourglass method is inventive but slightly rushed in execution. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Infernal kitchen is vividly rendered with sensory details that amplify the atmosphere. The setting and object (ribbon) are meaningfully connected, enhancing thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ribbon, hourglass) and emotional depth. Ending is satisfying, though the climax could linger slightly longer. Theme of forgiveness is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clich√©s. The "abrasive calm" tone is distinctive, though slightly uneven. Nuanced handling of silence and unspoken regret.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Creative fusion of concepts. Lingers in the mind, though the "cosmic silence" motif feels slightly overambitious.</comment>
