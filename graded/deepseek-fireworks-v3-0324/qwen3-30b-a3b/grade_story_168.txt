<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena's ruthlessness and spontaneity are well-integrated, but her motivations could be more deeply explored. The comb serves as a strong symbol, but her backstory feels somewhat glossed over.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced effectively, but the "road trip of words" feels abrupt. The revelation about the rock art as a warning is compelling but could be more smoothly transitioned into.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stone circle setting is evocative and well-utilized, enhancing the mystery. The singer’s verses and wind add atmospheric depth, though the timeframe could be more vividly tied to the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, rock art) and subtext ("polite anarchy"). The ending is satisfying, but some dialogue feels slightly contrived ("Call me a question").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("sound that felt like breaking glass"). However, the "watcher’s burden" concept leans slightly toward abstraction without enough grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of observation and memory.</comment>
