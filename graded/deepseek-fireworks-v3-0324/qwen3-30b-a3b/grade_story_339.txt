<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but slightly obscured by poetic abstraction. Her actions align well with her past, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but feels elliptical; the seesaw's echo drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is exquisiteâ€”prismatic lake and construction contrast brilliantly, enhancing the melancholic atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate. Lingering melancholy works well.</comment>
