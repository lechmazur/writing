<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The illusionist's sweetly fierce nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to defy genetic limitations is clear and consistent. Her reactions to the folding fan and the memory of fire reveal depth, though her dialogue could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the illusionist's mediation, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between the park's decay and the fairies' revival is compelling but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground city and cosmic hush create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the fairies' brittle wings and the fan's lacquered surface are evocative and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the fan, fire) and evokes emotion, but the rival illusionist's intrusion feels abrupt. The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper into the theme of rebirth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality in its blend of magic and decay. The language is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering impression but could further explore the cosmic hush's implications.</comment>
