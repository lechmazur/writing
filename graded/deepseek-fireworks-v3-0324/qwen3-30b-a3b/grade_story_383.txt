<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The general's weary resolve and the contrast between his battlefield command and diner introspection are sharply drawn, though his "rationally absurd" mutterings could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The photo's arc revelation is a elegant pivot, but the transition from seaweed to arc feels slightly abrupt. Otherwise, pacing and coherence are masterful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The diner's neon-and-void atmosphere is a haunting backdrop; seaweed’s storm-like texture and photos folding the universe are standout sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (arcs as unspoken truths) and the ending’s lingering question about fear elevate this beyond mere vignette. Only the "mischievous wisdom" tone wobbles.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dark matter diner conceit, though "shared anxieties" leans generic. Metaphors (seaweed as memory) are fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with the quiet hum of the diner’s neon.</comment>
