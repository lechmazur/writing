<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s fragmented self and dream-thief conviction are compelling but slightly underdeveloped. Her "mathematically challenged" attribute feels underutilized in shaping her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is tight and resonant, though the sport’s late reveal slightly disrupts pacing. The plunge action is masterfully executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss, scent of rain, and treehouse setting create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. The library’s isolation magnifies Lira’s struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (album as fragmented self) and sensory detail. The ending’s emotional payoff is profound and unexpected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The dream-thief premise and post-human world feel fresh, though "quiet mania" tone wobbles.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity serves the story’s poetic intensity. Leaves a lingering question about memory’s power.</comment>
