<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's "wholeheartedly broken" state and hardheadedness are established but lack deeper exploration. Her motivation (finding solace) is clear, but her internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the prophecy's resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit, but the labyrinth's role could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gallery and snow create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (old paper, burning parchment) are evocative, though the "shifting walls" could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror, snowflakes) and subtext (power vs. grief) are effective. The ending is purposeful, but the theme could resonate more deeply with sharper prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is marred by tropes (prophecy, powerful relic). Some phrases ("hushed cathedral") verge on clich√©, though the tone avoids excessive floridity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its length. The refusal of power is a strong, lingering choice.</comment>
