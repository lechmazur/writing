<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clown's bleakness and motivation are vividly portrayed, with their actions and private poetry revealing depth. However, their 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the clown's action, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock studio and dawn timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like incense and the clock's glint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors, but some phrases ("jagged generosity") feel slightly forced. Tone is consistent and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question about time's tyranny.</comment>
