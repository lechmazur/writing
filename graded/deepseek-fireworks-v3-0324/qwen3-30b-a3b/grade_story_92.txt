<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; his "carefully careless" nature is hinted at but not deeply explored, leaving his actions feeling slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tense, but the blood-drive encounter feels abrupt, disrupting the otherwise smooth pacing and thematic build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout—vivid sensory details (jasmine, decay, blood) create an immersive, haunting mood that elevates the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext (botanical collection as control vs. decay), though the ending’s ambiguity slightly undermines its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The mansion’s eerie uniqueness and Elias’ nuanced curiosity lend freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly coalesce well, but the blood-drive detour feels tangential. The brevity works, though deeper exploration would strengthen cohesion.</comment>
