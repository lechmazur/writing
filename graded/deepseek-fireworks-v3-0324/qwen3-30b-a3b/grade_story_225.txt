<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The apothecary's motivation is clear and their actions align with their traits, but their "unjustly fair" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the Morse code twist feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and a rich steampunk atmosphere elevate the setting, but the "battered marvel" tone wavers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and emotional resonance, though the theme of "unconventional love" is overshadowed by the virus conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original but leans on tropes (healer-turned-outcast). Some metaphors are fresh, others generic ("ghost of their notes").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice, but the steampunk setting feels slightly forced.</comment>
