<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear—power, however corrupt—and his gambler's nature aligns well with his actions. His "typically never" rule adds depth, though his voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the bottle confessions feel slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect is logical, though pacing wobbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and "unremembered future" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (creaking, laughter) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (diary, bottle) and subtext about power's cost. Ending is purposeful, though the theme could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Metaphors ("roots like fingers") are vivid. Emotion is shown, not stated, with nuanced despair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering question about power’s corruption, suggesting depth.</comment>
