<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noble's empirically rebellious nature and his use of chalk as a tool of defiance are compelling, though his "dazed" state could be more deeply explored to enhance his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is tightly woven, with the sidewalk exchanges and garden’s influence creating a satisfying coherence. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound garden and dawn setting are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (resonant stones, crushed lapis) deepening the atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (spiral time, alchemical metaphors) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the "benign ferocity" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of logic/madness, but the noble's "daze" borders on cliché. Metaphors (e.g., "twin stars") are fresh but occasionally overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical meditation on impermanence. The short length feels intentional, and the interplay of elements is inventive.</comment>
