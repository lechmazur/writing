<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The warlock's arrogance and desperation are vividly portrayed, with his thin-lipped smirk and trembling voice revealing layers of flawed certainty. His distinct voice and clear, albeit reckless, motivation drive his actions convincingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the warlock's ritual unfolding logically from discovery to consequence. Pacing is sharp, and the ending—though unresolved—feels purposeful, achieving a complete arc despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with the abandoned mine's dust-choked air and eerie glow of the fragment heightening tension. Sensory details (parchment scent, brittle pages) deepen the setting's decay and foreboding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fragment as burden, library as labyrinth) and the warlock's tragic epiphany elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, probing the cost of knowledge without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original turns of phrase ("time had forgotten to breathe," "a burden as heavy as the world") avoid cliché. The warlock's paradoxical confidence and fear feel authentically human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's theme of dangerous obsession. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for ambiguity. A haunting, cohesive work.</comment>
