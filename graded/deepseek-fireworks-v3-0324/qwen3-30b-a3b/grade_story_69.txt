<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The druid's motivation is clear and their relationship with the tin adds depth, but their 'uncertain' trait could be more vividly shown through actions rather than narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot moves logically, but the hologram shop's purpose feels underdeveloped. The ending resolves neatly, though the transition to the audition is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a rich atmosphere, and the hologram shop's mood amplifies the druid's internal struggle effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though minor clich√©s ("forge beauty from anarchy") slip in. Emotional nuance is well-handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, but the hologram shop feels slightly tacked on. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
