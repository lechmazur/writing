<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's "unyielding compassion" is well-integrated into their actions, but the "secret astral projector" aspect feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the core narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by "fleeing," but the "tracking sun shadows" method feels contrived and disrupts pacing slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing atmosphere and tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the key as a tether) and a resonant ending, though the "sometimes always" mantra feels forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (haunted carnival, mystical key). Some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. The brevity works, but the astral projector concept feels superfluous.</comment>
