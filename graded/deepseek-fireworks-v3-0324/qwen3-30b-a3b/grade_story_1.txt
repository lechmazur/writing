<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's phobias and stunt double background create a layered, compelling character. Their motivation—dancing on madness's edge—is clear and drives the narrative, though the stunt double role feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc—finding the envelope, unraveling the net, and confronting fears—is tight and purposeful. Pacing is excellent, with no wasted words, though the pyramid's sudden intro feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and eerie, with rust, dust, and whispers amplifying the spiritual mundanity. The pyramid library is hauntingly vivid, though its connection to the net could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft: the net's symbolism, the library's echoes, and Kael's trembling hands all deepen the theme of fear and surrender. The ending is resonant and leaves a lingering weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("dust motes danced like echoes"). Minimal clichés, though "edge of madness" leans familiar. Nuanced emotion shines in Kael's quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story perfectly. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving the reader with a haunting question: What lies beyond surrender?</comment>
