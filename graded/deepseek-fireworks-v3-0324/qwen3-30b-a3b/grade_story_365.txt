<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's deflated state and yearning to rewrite history are compelling, but their sudden hesitation at the end feels slightly abrupt for such a decisive character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is tight and purposeful, though the ritual’s mechanics could be clearer. The ending’s thematic pivot is strong but risks feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—carnival decay and subconscious haze meld perfectly. Sensory details (empty perfume bottle, rusted poles) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (rope, bottle) and layered subtext. The ending’s bittersweet resonance lingers, though the prose occasionally verges on ornate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story elegantly, though the rope’s role could feel esoteric to some readers.</comment>
