<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wanderer's motivation is clear, but their backstory and deeper psyche could be more fleshed out. Their reactions reveal some nuance, but the dialogue with the captain feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the apple's fall as a signal could be more explicitly tied to the wanderer's research earlier for smoother cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The crow’s nest’s contradictions and the apple’s translucency are standout elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a memorable ending. The dialogue is sharp but sparse. The theme of love as a universal cipher is compelling but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and a distinct style. Avoids clichés, though the "love as equations" concept edges toward abstraction without enough grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative interplay of elements. Leaves a lingering question—about the nature of "remember"—but the brevity suits it.</comment>
