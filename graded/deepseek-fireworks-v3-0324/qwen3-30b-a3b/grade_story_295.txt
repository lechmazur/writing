<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's jovial nature and sellsword background create a compelling contrast with his deeper, reluctant resolve. His motivation to "dethrone doubt" is clear but could benefit from slightly more explicit internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The spiral from decay to redemption is tightly paced, though the time capsule's sudden introduction feels slightly abrupt. Cause and effect are otherwise masterfully interwoven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The garden's transformation is evoked with vivid sensory detail, and the telescope's celestial imagery elegantly mirrors the thematic arc. Atmosphere is near-perfect.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spirals, starlight) elevates the prose, and the ending's emotional payoff is potent. Minor quibble: the "treasure is himself" revelation borders on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the garden's magical decay and Kael's arc, though "liquid starlight" verges on whimsical clich√©. Nuanced handling of reluctance saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense microcosm. The length feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story's elegance rather than constrain it.</comment>
