<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with the broken zipper serving as a potent symbol of his rebellion. His actions align well with his "impersonally personal" mission, but deeper personal stakes could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent, with a clear arc from isolation to defiance, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Pacing manages the constraints well, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with the observation deck and nebulae creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon glow, pulsing nebulae) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (zipper, nebulae) and layered themes elevate the storytelling. The ending lingers, though a sharper central conflict could intensify impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("ghost in the machine," "crucible of contradictions") avoid clich√©. Original voice, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the zipper and folklore dissection serving the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant questions.</comment>
