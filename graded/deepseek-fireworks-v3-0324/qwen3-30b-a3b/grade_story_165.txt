<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear and consistent, with their gentle nature and reverence for restoration shining through. However, their distinct "voice" is somewhat muted due to limited dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "reversed messages" method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, moss-scented air) enhancing the subterranean atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the butterfly, the garden) and lyrical prose elevate the storytelling. The ending is satisfying, though the "joyful terror" tone isnâ€™t fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases ("inscrutably obvious") border on contrived, but the overall style is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
