<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sculptor's brooding nature and motivation to escape servitude are compelling, though his "theoretically spontaneous" decision feels slightly underdeveloped. His relationship with the glasses adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's mystical resolution is original and cohesive, though the transition from carving marble to vanishing into dust could be smoother. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the crater base and dust motes create a haunting, immersive mood. The setting enhances the theme of entrapment and liberation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (glasses, dust) and subtext. The ending lingers with poetic resonance, and the prose elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The dust-as-escape method is inventive, though the "webs of intrigue" metaphor leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a haunting, thematically rich narrative. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
