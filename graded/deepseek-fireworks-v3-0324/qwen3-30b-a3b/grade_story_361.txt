<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The trapper’s motivation is clear and compelling, but his "mild-mannered" trait feels underexplored. His mechanical intuition and guardianship role are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pacing is tight, and the plot coheres around the dice and equations. The ending is purposeful, though the schoolhouse’s "pulse" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic diner and "brink of change" era mesh evocatively, but the diner could be more vividly rendered. Neon and chalk details immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong subtext about cultural preservation. Literary devices (e.g., neon as "dying heartbeat") elevate the prose. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of indigenous knowledge and retro-futurism. No clichés, though "guardian of the hearth" borders on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. Short length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the "old math’s" fate.</comment>
