<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with the puzzle ring, revealing resilience and transformation. However, his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed, with the implosion of the ring as a satisfying climax. Pacing is excellent, but the connection between light's boundaries and the bark texture could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten museum and fossilized bones create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (sound of the note, touch of bark) are masterfully used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ring as failure/sphere as rebirth) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the theme of light's boundaries slightly overshadows other layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "excited boredom" feels underdeveloped. The obsidian ring and bark method are fresh, though the dinosaur bones are underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and polished, with elements serving the narrative. Leaves a lingering question about perception and transformation.</comment>
