<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is compelling and consistent, but its "voice" lacks distinctiveness. The paradox of patience and frenzy is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the action, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The word limit is managed well, but the climax could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details and atmosphere are vivid and immersive. The sky burial site reinforces the theme brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and literary devices, with a thought-provoking ending. However, the thematic depth slightly overshadows emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, though some phrases border on overly ornate. The handling of "euphoric agitation" is fresh but occasionally forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question, though the brevity slightly limits its impact.</comment>
