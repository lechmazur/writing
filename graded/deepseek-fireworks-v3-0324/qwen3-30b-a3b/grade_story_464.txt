<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's sass and academic mischief are vividly portrayed, driving her actions with clear motivation. Her distinct voice and rebellious nature stand out, though her role as a cook feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the polaroid camera and treasure chests driving the narrative coherently. Pacing is effective, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of destabilized reality.</comment>
