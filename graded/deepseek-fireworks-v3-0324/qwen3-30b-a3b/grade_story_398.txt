<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conjurer's sincerity and resilience are well-portrayed, though their backstory feels slightly underexplored. Their motivation aligns with their actions, but deeper introspection could strengthen their voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the shared dream method feels abrupt. The calendar's role as a map is clever, though the transition to the cellar could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with rich sensory details. The "ashes" concept and setting intertwine beautifully, though "between waves" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, particularly with the calendar and fire motif. The ending resonates, but the dream sequence's resolution leans slightly tell-heavy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "dysfunctionally functional" theme is fresh, though the conjurer's reasoning borders on overly logical at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story with creative element integration. The length feels deliberate, though the dream mechanic could be more fleshed out.</comment>
