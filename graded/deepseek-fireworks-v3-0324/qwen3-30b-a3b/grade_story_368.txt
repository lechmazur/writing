<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's streetwise nature and orphan background inform his cautious yet curious actions. His motivation to "harvest hope" is clear, and his reaction to the brooch reveals his internal conflict. His voice is distinct, though slightly more introspection could deepen his character.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard temple's surreal atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (glowing fruit, humming air). The setting enhances the theme of timelessness, and the brooch's connection to the temple's motifs is seamless.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (brooch as mirror, fruit as hope) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, leaving room for reflection. Literary devices are wielded skillfully, and the conflict—internal and external—is compelling.</comment>
