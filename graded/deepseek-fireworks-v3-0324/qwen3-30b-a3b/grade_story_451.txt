<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but some actions (e.g., hiring actors) feel slightly contrived. Her distinct voice and reaction to the baseball reveal depth, though her resolve could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly paced, with a strong arc. The baseball’s transformation and mirror shattering are effective, but the actors’ role feels underdeveloped given their significance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("crystal shadows," "fractured glass across the snow") immerse the reader. The mountain peak and market bustle contrast brilliantly, enhancing tension and mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, baseball) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying and thematic, though the dialogue ("You’re not her") could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The time-traveler twist and fractured identity theme stand out. Minor over-reliance on "crystal shadows" as a motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story’s depth, leaving a lingering question about identity. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
