<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and his actions align with his frenetic, defiant nature. The lunchbox as a relic adds depth, though his "formally imperfect" attire feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, with a clear arc, but the power outage trigger feels tangential. The labyrinth’s sudden emergence could benefit from smoother cause-and-effect scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and a haunting atmosphere elevate the setting. The reading room and ancient echoes meld seamlessly, though the tree ring connection is faint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the power outage feels forced. The brevity suits the hallucinatory tone, leaving a lingering mystique.</comment>
