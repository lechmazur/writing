<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The midwife's critical nature and secretive demeanor are well-integrated, but her motivation to recover stolen memories could be more explicitly tied to her personal history earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the diaries and herbs driving the narrative. The pacing is excellent, though the resolution could linger slightly more on the midwife's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom are vividly rendered, with sensory details (herbs, ashes) deepening the atmosphere. The dissonant calm is masterfully sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herbs as bridges, ashes as prayers) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the theme of wisdom could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors ("wisdom grew in the spaces between what was lost"). Minimal clich√©, though "fractured heartbeat" verges on familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that lingers. The elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional.</comment>
