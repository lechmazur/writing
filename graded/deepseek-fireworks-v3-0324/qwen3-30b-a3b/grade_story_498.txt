<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nervous kingpin's motivation is clear, but his shift from distrust to scattering seeds feels slightly abrupt. His 'voice' is distinct but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the detour's payoff (the child's appearance) could be more earned. The arc is complete but leans on familiar tropes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details (brittle pods, damp greenhouse). The enclave and midwinter setting enhance tension but occasionally overshadow character nuance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (seed pods as control/offerings) and subtext, but some metaphors ("fragile ferocity") are overused. Ending resonates but verges on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on predictable contrasts (hoarding vs. sharing). Language is purposeful but some phrases ("tyranny of indifference") feel pretentious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thoughtful, though the child's role feels contrived. Leaves a lingering question about the enclave's future, suggesting depth.</comment>
