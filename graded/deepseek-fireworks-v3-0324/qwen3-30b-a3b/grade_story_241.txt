<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's soft-voiced guidance and her connection to the embroidered vest create a distinct, memorable character. Her motivation to "harness the scream of silent plains" is poetic and consistent, though slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit, but the "different train" detail feels underutilized. The blackout's paradox ("宁静 and torment") drives the story effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating cloud cafe and blackout setting are vividly rendered, with immersive sensory details (steaming cups, churning clouds). The atmosphere amplifies the story's themes of silence and revelation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vest as a "promise to listen") and lyrical prose elevate the storytelling. The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue occasionally leans toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clichés. The "scream of silent plains" metaphor is fresh, though the term "blissful agony" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The brevity feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story’s themes of silence and connection.</comment>
