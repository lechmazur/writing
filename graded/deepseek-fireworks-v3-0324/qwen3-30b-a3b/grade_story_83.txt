<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, but her "suspiciously trusting" nature feels underexplored. Her voice is distinct, though more nuance in her reactions would elevate it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, but the climax's mirror-revelation feels slightly rushed. Pacing is otherwise strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; mirrors and candlelight create vivid, haunting immersion. Setting and object intertwine seamlessly to heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (mirrors as self-confrontation). Ending is purposeful, though the "mischievous wisdom" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases border on overly ornate. Avoids clichés, though the cryptid premise feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering thematic weight—clever use of constraints.</comment>
