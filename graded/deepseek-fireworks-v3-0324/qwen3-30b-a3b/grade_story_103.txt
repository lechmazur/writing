<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's internal conflict and gradual realization of his imprisonment as a test are compelling, though his backstory remains vaguely hinted at rather than fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's cyclical structure—beginning and ending with the door knocker—is elegant, and the pacing balances introspection with momentum. Minor gaps in the "how" of the prison's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere: the lighthouse prison’s corrosive isolation and the serpent’s eerie agency immerse the reader. Sensory details (storm, rusted compass) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, serpent) and layered themes of guilt and forgiveness elevate the narrative. The ending’s ambiguity is purposeful, though the "joyful agony" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "grudgingly sweet" feels overused. The knight’s arc avoids cliché, though the prison-as-test twist leans slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story’s emotional core, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
