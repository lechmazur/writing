<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and motivation to reconcile with Kael are compelling, though her impulsiveness could be more deeply explored to add nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s metaphysical twist on a mechanical object is inventive, and the resolution ties neatly back to the conflict. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city is vividly rendered, its micro-mechanics enhancing the mask’s mystique and Elara’s isolation. Atmosphere is immersive.</comment>
