<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's reserved nature and humbly proud heart are well-integrated, but her transition from composer to oracle could be more explicitly fleshed out for stronger motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s circular structure—beginning and ending with the choir—creates satisfying coherence, though the "ripple effect" concept could be more tightly woven into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly rendered, with sensory details (whispering scrawls, glass jars) deepening the atmosphere. Only minor tightening of choir-setting integration needed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cuffs as maps, mending as prayer) and poignant subtext elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the thematic "ripple" could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of melodies") avoid cliché, but slight overuse of "humbly proud" and "ripple effect" risks repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that justifies its brevity. The elements serve the story, though the choir’s role could be more nuanced.</comment>
