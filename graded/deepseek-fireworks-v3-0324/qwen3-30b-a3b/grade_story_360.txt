<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's characterization is richly developed, with clear motivation (decoding the riddle) and consistent reactions to his surroundings. His attachment to the broken pen and his introspective nature shine through.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from struggle to revelation. The dew-drop moment is slightly abrupt but serves as a logical pivot. Pacing is well-managed within the limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with the underground goblin city and playground sounds creating a striking contrast. Sensory details (ink pooling, dew drop) enhance the mystic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly evocative storytelling, with potent symbolism (the tapestry, broken pen) and a resonant theme. The ending is satisfying and lingers. Literary devices are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The meek necromancer trope is subverted, and the dew-drop insight feels fresh. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thoughtful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression. Creative and layered.</comment>
