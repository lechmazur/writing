<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, her vendetta deeply personal, and her actions align with her creative precision. The marzipan locket adds a poignant layer to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from the market to the cave. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the rebellion's timeframe could be more explicitly woven in.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The market's decay and the scent of burnt caramel create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (sugar spires, faded ink) immerse the reader and reinforce the theme of memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (edible art as rebellion) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the transition to rebuilding feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The candy sculptor premise is inventive, and the scornful tone avoids purple prose. Minor quibble: "Aetheris" could feel slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the locket and photographs driving the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Aetheris.</comment>
