<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The philosopher's barefoot wandering and stamp-collecting reveal a seeker's soul, but their motivation—composing a lullaby—feels slightly abstract. Their voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flash mob encounter propels the plot elegantly, but the accelerator's role is underutilized. The arc is coherent but could tighten.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sterile accelerator corridors and hum of machinery create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cold floors, wet stamp ink) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—stamps as silent pleas, collisions as lullabies. The ending lingers, though the dancer's vanishing feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and hauntingly poetic. Avoids clichés, though "language of heartbreak" toes the line. Nuanced handling of entropy as love.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, but the accelerator could be more integral. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant, unresolved ache.</comment>
