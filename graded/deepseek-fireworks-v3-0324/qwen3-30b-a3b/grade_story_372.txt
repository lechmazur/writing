<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The spy's motivation is clear, but his actions sometimes feel disjointed. The "curiously indifferent" attribute adds nuance but isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the "unstoppable avalanche" metaphor feels overused. The ending resolves cleanly, though the cipher reveal is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Futuristic slums are vividly rendered with sensory detail, but the holograms/scaffolding clash slightly with the "rambling destiny" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (label, reflections), but the emotional impact wavers. Ending lingers, though the "recklessness" theme feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original but leans on noir tropes. The "fermented paste" sensory detail is fresh, but some metaphors (avalanche) lack originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the "shared interest in urban exploration" feels tacked on. Short length suits the introspective tone.</comment>
