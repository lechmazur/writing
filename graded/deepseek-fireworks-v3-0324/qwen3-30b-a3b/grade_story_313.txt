<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and consistent, with his defiant grin and taunting of the system revealing depth. His interactions with ghosts add layers to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the ghostly intervention feels slightly abrupt, disrupting the otherwise logical cause-and-effect flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dystopian farm's atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, enhancing the story's grit and Jax's defiance. The setting and tone align perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tape dispensers, ghosts) and a memorable ending, though the ghostly resolution borders on deus ex machina.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Jax's voice and the ghosts' whispers lend authenticity, though the "unusually normal" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering defiance but could delve deeper into theme.</comment>
