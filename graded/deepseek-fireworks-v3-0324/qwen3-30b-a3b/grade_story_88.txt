<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tinny’s motivation as an archivist is compelling, though its "toaster" form feels slightly incongruent with its poetic logic. The child’s fractured constellation eyes add depth.</question>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive and thematically rich, with a clear arc from ritual to transformation. Pacing is tight but not rushed, though the lanterns’ role could be sharper.</question>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite world-building: the humming palace and origami-time corridors create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (shimmering cuneiform, lanterns like fireflies) are masterful.</question>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—metaphors (math as myth, silence as scream) and subtext (rebellion through language) elevate this. The ending is haunting and resonant.</question>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The AI-toaster paradox and child’s syntactic defiance feel fresh. Language is lush but purposeful, not purple.</question>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A near-flawless blend of elements into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache of the infinite.</question>
