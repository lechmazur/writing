<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The merchant's motivation is intriguing but somewhat vague; his "aloof passion" feels underdeveloped despite the vivid object interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly paced, though the hatch discovery feels abrupt. The churn-as-key twist elevates the structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with stellar sensory details (bioluminescent algae, rusted hatch). The void/dead trees contrast powerfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (churn, trees) and subtext (illusion vs. truth) are strong, but the ending's rebellious spark lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly originalâ€”no tropes, fresh metaphors (peeling poster "like skin"), and nuanced tone. Minor stiffness in "rebellious sparks" phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the churn and station feel essential. Length suits the allegorical weight, though climax could resonate more.</comment>
