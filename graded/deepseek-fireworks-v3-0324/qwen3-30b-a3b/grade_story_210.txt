<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, blending intellectual curiosity with a spiritual quest, though his 'amiability' could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the crossword and lighthouse secrets driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—salty, rusted, and humming with ghostly energy. Sensory details (brine, flickering light) immerse the reader deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (crossword as cipher, lighthouse as bridge) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The "doubly singular" motif and shadow navigation feel fresh, though some phrasing borders on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's theme of reconciliation. Leaves a haunting, reflective aftertaste.</comment>
