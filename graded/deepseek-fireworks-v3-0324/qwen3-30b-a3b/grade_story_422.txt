<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's selectively mute ventriloquism is a compelling trait, but her motivation to archive weather patterns feels slightly disconnected from her emotional arc. Her shift to redefining family is powerful but could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the climax. The overheard phone call is a strong catalyst, but the transition to Lila performing without her puppet could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly rendered, blending surrealism with emotional weight. The diner and neon glow add grounding contrast. Sensory details (waves, cardboard sleeve) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the sleeve, weather as metaphor) are sharp, and the emotional payoff is resonant. However, the euphoric agitation tone feels overstated in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "pact with the void"). Minor AI-like phrasing ("euphoric agitation" stands out unnaturally), but overall, the prose avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well for such a short piece. The theme of voicelessness and connection lingers, though the parallel universe beach could be more integral.</comment>
