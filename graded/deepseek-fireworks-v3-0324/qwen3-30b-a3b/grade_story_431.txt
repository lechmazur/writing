<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's introversion and past as a dancer are well-integrated, but her motivation to escape feels slightly underdeveloped beyond survival.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly paced and coherent, with knitting and decoding weaving together logically. The ending delivers a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (static, aged paper) enhancing the desolate, cerebral tone. The office setting is vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (knitting as code-breaking) and subtext. Ending thrills but could delve deeper into emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("stars bleeding into edges of vision"). Minimal clich√©, though "wasteland" leans trope-adjacent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; length feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic weight (chaos vs. control, survival as art).</comment>
