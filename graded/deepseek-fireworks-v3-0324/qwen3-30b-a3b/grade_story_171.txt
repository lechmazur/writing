<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias' obsession is vividly portrayed, but his transition from stamps to the garnet feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his "ravenously gentle" nature could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphor, sacrificing some logical cause-and-effect. The ending resolves thematically but leaves narrative threads slightly loose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carnival's atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details elevating the mood. The faded orchard sign and bicycle-powered setting are standout touches.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the central conflict (garnet vs. search) blurs slightly. The ending lingers beautifully, but dialogue feels sparse and functional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but "ravenously gentle" and "bold vulnerability" verge on overwrought. Some metaphors (e.g., "heartbeat" for tape) feel recycled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storyâ€™s cohesion is impressive given its density, though a few elements (like the garnet) feel underdeveloped. The brevity serves its themes well.</comment>
