<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and consistent with his traits as a woodsman. His attachment to the hairbrush and the railway quest reveal layers of grief and purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's urgent task, though the connection between the hospital monitor and the water tower could be more organic. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and water tower create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (static hum, rusted metal) immerse the reader and amplify Elias's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (hairbrush, echoes) and literary devices are effective, though the ending’s emotional payoff slightly overshadows the journey's tension. Style enhances the story’s melancholy beauty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original in its blending of surreal and mundane, but the "freed by honesty" theme feels underdeveloped. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("cathedral of decay").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the hairbrush and railways grounding the surreal setting. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant, lingering question.</comment>
