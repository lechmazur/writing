<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's politeness and scholarly curiosity are well-defined and drive her actions consistently. Her "obnoxiously polite" attribute adds depth, though her transition to assertiveness could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well within the word limit, but the laundry cycles feel slightly forced as a hindrance. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and oak grove create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming, flickering lights) enhance the eerie yet scholarly tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (salt as a filter) and subtext (dialogue across time). The ending resonates, though some metaphors (moonlit dew) feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "tangled root system"). Avoids clich√©s, but the politeness motif edges toward gimmickry in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the box and salt crystals serving the theme elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
