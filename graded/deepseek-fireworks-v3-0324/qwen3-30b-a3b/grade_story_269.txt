<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tailor's nostalgia and desperation are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "ascend" feels slightly underdeveloped given the weight of his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from despair to choice, though the "last code" concept could be more explicitly tied to the mirror's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the steampunk deck and storm are immersive, and the mirror’s fracturing reflections amplify the theme of parallel lives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the "older voice" revelation borders on cliché. The ending lingers with haunting possibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "ascension" trope risks predictability. The prose avoids purple excess, though some metaphors (e.g., "failing engine") are overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The length feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story’s themes without crowding them.</comment>
