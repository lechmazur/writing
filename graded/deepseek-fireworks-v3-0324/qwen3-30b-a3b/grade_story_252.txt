<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending penitence with paradoxical self-loathing. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The method of recalibration via petals is inventive, and pacing is strong for the word limit. Minor coherence hiccup with the abrupt shift from vault to swing set.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered—sensory details (frostbitten soil, scent of peaches) elevate the eerie tone. Setting and object are meaningfully intertwined, though the vault’s purpose could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with potent symbolism (toy block, crack) and emotional resonance. Ending is hauntingly satisfying. Themes of redemption and memory are woven seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("icy warmth"). Avoids clichés and AI pitfalls. Nuanced emotion and style elevate it above generic speculative fiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate despite constraints. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Lingers with existential weight, though the swing set feels slightly tacked on.</comment>
