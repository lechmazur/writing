<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; graceful swordsman archetype is well-utilized, though deeper internal conflict could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the climax's execution feels slightly rushed. The connection between scavenging and awakening the force could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionalâ€”sensory details and atmosphere are vivid and immersive. The underwater garden is a standout, though "bird songs" feels slightly incongruent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's thematic resolution borders on didactic. Literary craft is polished, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but a few phrases ("fluid as the currents") feel repetitive. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper in the swordsman's realization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the story feels purposeful despite constraints. Leaves a lingering question about freedom vs. responsibility, though the garden's trap metaphor is slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
