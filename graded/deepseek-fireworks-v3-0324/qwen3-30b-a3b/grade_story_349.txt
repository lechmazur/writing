<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drone pilot's "cynically hopeful" mantra is compelling, but his transition from desperation to acceptance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive but the speed dating detour disrupts momentum. The observatory climax ties things together well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”crumbling stone, whispering winds, and the observatory's "charred serenity" are vividly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herb bundle, drone's voice) and a haunting ending, though the dialogue occasionally veers into pretension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("branches like skeletal fingers") and a surprising genre blend. Minor overuse of "hush" weakens originality slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole, but the speed dating feels contrived. The length suits the mood.</comment>
