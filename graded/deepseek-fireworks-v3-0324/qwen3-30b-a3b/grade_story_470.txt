<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's practicality and tinkering background align well with her motivation to guard wisdom. Her shift from performer to guardian is clear but could benefit from deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the screw and diary driving the arc. Pacing is strong, though the clockwork octopus encounter feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine library is vividly rendered, with sensory details (brass, bioluminescence) enhancing atmosphere. The street fairs' contrast adds depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (screw as talisman, "to preserve is to risk") and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the cipher logic could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of bardic and mechanical tropes. The "peculiar talents" angle feels fresh, though the guardian motif leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the submarine library feels purposeful. The length suits the epic-in-miniature scope, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
