<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her unlucky trait feels underdeveloped. Her "systematically chaotic" nature is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. The sextant’s role as a key feels organic, though the "sparring" resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional—bioluminescent fungi and pulsing walls create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The setting enhances every element of the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storytelling is strong with effective symbolism (sextant as key, plants as truth). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of balance is compelling.</comment>
