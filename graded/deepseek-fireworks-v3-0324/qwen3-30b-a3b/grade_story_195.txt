<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong portrayal of internal conflict and transformation; motivation is clear but "analytically unpredictable" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent but the sprint feels abrupt; pacing is otherwise well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative desert atmosphere, though the caravan setting is underutilized. Sensory details (sand, moon, thread) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spool as key) and emotional resonance, but the ending verges on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original voice, but some phrases ("heart hardened into a fortress") edge toward cliché. Nuanced handling of sorrow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively; the child’s toy revelation is a standout moment of creative thinking.</comment>
