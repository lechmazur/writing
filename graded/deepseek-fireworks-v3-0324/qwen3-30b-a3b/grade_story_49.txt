<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's "lukewarm" magic and his internal conflict are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "paint a future free from fear" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from hesitation to resolution, though the lunar base's role could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar base and "charred serenity" tone create a haunting atmosphere, but the "swirling stage fog" feels incongruent with the sci-fi setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (magic vs. void, facing echoes). The "lukewarm mage" label feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant narrative with a lingering sense of renewal. The brevity enhances its impact.</comment>
