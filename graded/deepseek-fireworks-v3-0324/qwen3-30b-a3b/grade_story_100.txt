<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vivid dreamer's actions and introspection are rich, but his ultimate motivation ("cosmic deception") feels slightly abstract compared to the grounded symbolism of the pennies.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's dreamlike structure coheres beautifully, with the moon path and statues guiding the arc, though the "threshold of an apology" could be more explicitly resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s sensory details (humming trees, rusted iron taste) and statues create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that elevates every action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lush prose and layered symbolism (pennies as regret, statues as silent judges) create lasting impact, though the ending’s thematic revelation borders on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("branches bending like the necks of ancient beasts"), though "dour amusement" slightly strains tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of assigned elements, with the orchard’s magic lingering beyond the page—only the apology’s pivot to self-forgiveness feels abrupt.</comment>
