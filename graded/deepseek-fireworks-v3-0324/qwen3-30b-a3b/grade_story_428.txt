<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arjun's transformation is compelling, but his shift from planner to prepper feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the ritual's introduction could be smoother. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is richly evoked, and sensory details (ink blotter's scent, stone weight) enhance immersion. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (ink blotter as doubt/chains) and subtext. The ending resonates deeply, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, but "rarely authentic" feels slightly forced. Avoids tropes and shows stylistic flair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question.</comment>
