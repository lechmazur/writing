<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archer's apprehension and motivation are clear, though their "usually exceptional" trait feels underdeveloped. The child's laughter memory adds emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The candle's role as a cipher ties the beginning and end together, though the hot air balloon festival feels slightly forced.</comment>
