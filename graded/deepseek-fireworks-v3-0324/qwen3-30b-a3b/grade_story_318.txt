<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, his aloofness and halfhearted commitment subtly shaping his interactions with the spoon and lullabies. Motivation is raw but clear, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is taut and cohesive, with the spoon and lullabies driving the arc elegantly. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library's atmospheric blend of gloom and cheerfulness is masterful, with sensory details (humming walls, flickering crystals) deepening immersion. Spoon and setting are deeply intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: lullabies as symbolism, the spoon's tactile imagery, and a theme of resilience resonate powerfully. Subtext enriches every line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés. Nuanced emotion (e.g., "quiet, unyielding fire") and fresh metaphors elevate it. Style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the spoon and library feel indispensable. Leaves a haunting, hopeful aftertaste. Brief length enhances impact.</comment>
