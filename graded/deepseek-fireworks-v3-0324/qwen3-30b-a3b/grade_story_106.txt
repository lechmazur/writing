<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's sullenness and motivation are clear, but his transition to defiance feels slightly rushed. The quilt and stamps reveal depth, though his "objective bias" could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent but compressed; the underwater setting's connection to his epiphany could be stronger. Pacing is effective but leans on exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details. The power station contrasts well with Elias's rural life, though its role in his transformation isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (quilt, stamps) and emotional resonance, but the ending's hope feels slightly unearned. Themes of liberation are poignant but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The quilt's symbolism is fresh, but "borrowed valor" tone feels underdeveloped. Nuanced handling of emotion elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the underwater setting's purpose is vague. Leaves a lingering question about Elias's future, suggesting depth.</comment>
