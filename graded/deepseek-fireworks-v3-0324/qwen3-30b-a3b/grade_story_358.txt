<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thaddeus's motivation is clear and his actions align with his traits, though his 'purposefully aimless' attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc. The mirror encounters and tomb reveal are effective, though the playground time feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse and desert tomb are vividly contrasted, enhancing the story's atmosphere. Sensory details like "frost clung to glass" are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism and subtext (e.g., the mirrors as reflections of the soul). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The handling of emotion and theme is nuanced, though a few phrases ("sanctified dread") edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
