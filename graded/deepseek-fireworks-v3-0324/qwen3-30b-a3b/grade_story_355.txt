<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dancer's aloofness and internal conflict are well-portrayed, though her "harshly compassionate" attribute could be more explicitly explored in her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a clear arc; the compass and letters home drive the narrative logically, though the "mapping scattered dreams" method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Psychedelic installation is vividly rendered, amplifying the dancer's emotional unraveling. Sensory details (e.g., pulsing colors, cracked tiles) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (compass as fractured self) and symbolism. The ending is resonant, though the "forgotten revelry" tone could be more consistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases verge on overwrought ("hush of forgotten revelry"). Emotional nuance is strong, but a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful; the elements serve the storyâ€™s depth. The brevity enhances its impact, leaving a lingering sense of catharsis.</comment>
