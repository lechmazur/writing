<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias' insecurity is palpable and drives his actions, but his motivation to find the brain feels slightly underdeveloped. His "voice" is distinct, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds tension well, but the resolution feels abrupt. The 'jab' action is effective, though the twist of multiple jars could be foreshadowed more elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully evoked—dust, rust, and eerie echoes immerse the reader. The setting enhances the story's existential dread, though "simmering future" is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the brain as identity) and subtext (echoes as doubt). The ending lingers, but the theme of duplication could be deeper. Literary craft is polished.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases verge on cliché ("groaning like a dying man"). Emotional nuance is strong, though the 'fractured idyll' tone feels inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole, but the word limit strains the exploration of duality. The story’s brevity works, yet richer thematic payoff would elevate it.</comment>
