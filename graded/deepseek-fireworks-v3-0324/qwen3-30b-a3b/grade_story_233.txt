<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's naivety and persistence are clear, but deeper psychological layers could elevate her further. Her motivation is consistent but somewhat surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The concept of "seeds of understanding" ties neatly to the resolution, though the "between commercials" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, blending dust, light, and static evocatively. The vault's eerie, mythic quality enhances the story's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (statue, lullaby) and subtext about belief. The ending resonates, though the dialogue with the guardian is slightly stiff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("time bent between commercials"). Minor AI-ish quirks: "peculiarly virtual" feels over-explained, and some phrasing leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the lullaby theme particularly unifying. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
