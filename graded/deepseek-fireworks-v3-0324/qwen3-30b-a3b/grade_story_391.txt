<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's roguish minstrel persona is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His past as a blacksmith adds depth, though his minstrel side could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-structured, with a clear arc. The driftwood carvings drive the narrative, though the climax (galvanizing the city) feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (apron, piano) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "quiet revolution" theme could be more sharply defined.</comment>
