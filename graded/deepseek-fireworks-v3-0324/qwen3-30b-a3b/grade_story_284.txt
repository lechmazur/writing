<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rourke’s stoic exterior and emotional depth are compelling, but his "pirate radio operator" backstory feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but slightly forced in the context of the story.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the transition from bar to beekeeper’s sanctuary is abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but leans on clichéd emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, particularly the beekeeper’s sanctuary. The bar and sanctuary contrast effectively, though the bar’s role feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (paper plane, key) and emotional subtext, but some dialogue feels overwritten ("You navigate uncharted emotional depths"). The ending is poignant but slightly heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements (pirate, beekeeper, sincerity), but the "pompous humility" tone occasionally clashes. The prose avoids clichés but verges on self-conscious literariness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, though some elements (pirate radio operator) feel superfluous. The brevity works in its favor, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
