<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's late-blooming heroism and calloused hands hint at depth, but motivations could be sharper. His transformation from passive to active feels organic, though his "slow mind" is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the spyglass as a deus ex machina. Pacing is tight, though the leap from attic to cosmic reckoning feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (rusted pipes, tarnished brass) immerse the reader. The rooftop farm and fractured sky merge seamlessly with the theme of loss.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spyglass as bridge) and poetic prose elevate the narrative. The ending's hopeful pulse resonates, though the survivors' roles lack depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("seed cracking open," "cosmos learning to weep") avoid clich√©. The tone balances awe and grit without slipping into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite density. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on grief and agency.</comment>
