<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—uncovering the town's secrets—and her actions align with her conspiracy theorist reputation. However, her "discreetly flagrant" defiance could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc. The ritual's steps are logical, and the pacing balances urgency with mystery. The ending is purposeful but slightly ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with strong sensory details (static, old wood, metallic scent). The anomaly and setting enhance the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative use of symbolism (handkerchief as tether) and subtext (silence as both relief and doom). The ending lingers, prompting reflection on sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original handling of generational curses with fresh metaphors (e.g., "static crackled louder"). Avoids tropes and maintains a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated. The word limit feels deliberate, and the story leaves a haunting, unresolved tension.</comment>
