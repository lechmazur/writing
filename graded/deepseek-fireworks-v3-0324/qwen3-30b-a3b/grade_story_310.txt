<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with their methodically chaotic nature and connection to silence strongly shaping their actions. Their defiance through hijacking bulletin boards reveals depth, though some nuance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Kael's resistance driving the narrative logically. The climax and resolution feel earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the Tidekeepers' confrontation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater city is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent details and coral labyrinths enhancing the atmosphere. The hammer's connection to the drowned past enriches the setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story deftly uses symbolism (hammer, silence) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending lingers, though the thematic weight of "choosing silence" could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Kael's defiance feels authentically human, and the underwater setting is inventive. Minor over-reliance on "silence" as a motif slightly dulls its impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story excels in cohesion and creative use of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression, though the Tidekeepers could be more fleshed out.</comment>
