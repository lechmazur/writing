<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized, his motivations (rejecting conformity, selling contradictions) are consistent and deeply woven into his actions and rituals. His voice is distinct, especially in his absurd solemnity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc from Marcus’s daily ritual to his reflections on his own contradictions. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, never rushed or dragging.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck is richly evoked, with sensory details (purple-green phosphorescence) enhancing the atmosphere. Setting and character are perfectly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (the zipper as metaphor), layered subtext, and a hauntingly purposeful ending. The story lingers in the mind, prompting reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><remark>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("a sound like grinding gears") and nuanced emotional subtext. No AI-generic phrasing or abrupt shifts.</remark>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant thematic impact. A standout piece.</comment>
