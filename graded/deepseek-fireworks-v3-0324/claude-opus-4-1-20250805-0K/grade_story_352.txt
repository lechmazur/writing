<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nomad's feral yet purposeful nature is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her voice is distinct, blending wildness and melancholy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from arrival to departure. Pacing is excellent despite brevity, and cause/effect (star deaths → conservation) is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is sublime—factory and vanishing stars merge seamlessly. Sensory details (liquid starlight, humming) immerse the reader in a haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext (ink as memory, dancing as defiance). The ending lingers, and the conflict (preservation vs. oblivion) is poignant and unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. No clichés; fresh metaphors ("breathing underwater or loving someone already gone"). Nuanced emotion and style defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The length feels intentional, and the story resonates beyond its words—a meditation on ephemeral beauty.</comment>
