<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's duality (lumberjack-healer) is compelling, but her transition from suspicion to acceptance feels slightly rushed. The "gracefully awkward" attribute is vivid but could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the future-war premise strains logic. Pacing is strong, though the wine cellar confrontation could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ossuary-restaurant is brilliantly eerie; sensory details (flour-dusted tears, bone bottle racks) elevate atmosphere. Bike rides as nightmare triggers are hauntingly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (bones as vessels for healing) and thematic depth, but the ending's resolution leans slightly didactic. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, but the "healer-warrior" trope is familiar. Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought ("harsh tenderness").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the future-war twist feels grafted. The story lingers but could risk more ambiguity.</comment>
