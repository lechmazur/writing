<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cornelius and Lady Pemberton are vividly drawn, with clear, nuanced motivations and distinct voices. Their dynamic and reactions to the bottle cap reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from obsession to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending’s resolution could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The jungle parlor setting is immersive and brilliantly contrasts with Victorian propriety. Sensory details (vines, humidity, howler monkeys) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext, potent symbolism (bottle cap as divine currency), and evocative prose. The ending’s thematic payoff is strong but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors and no clichés. The earnest absurdity feels wholly human, not algorithmic. Language is precise yet lyrical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thoughtful story where all elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering question about faith and absurdity.</comment>
