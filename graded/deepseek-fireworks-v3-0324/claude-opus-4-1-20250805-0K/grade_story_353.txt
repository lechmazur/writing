<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martha's "cynically gentle" nature is skillfully woven into her rebellion, making her motivation clear and unique. Her baker's patience and lunar tracking align perfectly with her quiet revolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pressed flowers as temporal viruses driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels both inevitable and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garage and lunar-time fusion creates a richly atmospheric world. Sensory details (flour-dusted hands, whispering shadows) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the story layers symbolism (bread as rebellion, flowers as time-bombs) and delivers a profound theme about subtle resistance. The prose is vivid but never overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—subverts tropes (the baker as revolutionary) and avoids clichés. Nuanced emotions and fresh metaphors ("kneading revolution into tomorrow's bread") stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where all elements serve the story. Leaves a haunting question: Can small acts unravel grand oppression?</comment>
