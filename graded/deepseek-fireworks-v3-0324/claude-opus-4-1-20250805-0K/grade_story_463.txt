<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with dry wit and clear motivation—his knowledge of the Mariner’s Waltz and his grandmother’s history lend depth. His actions align perfectly with his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured; the dance ritual drives the narrative cohesively, and the cause-effect logic (keeper’s death → Marcus’s intervention) is airtight. Pacing is superb for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse bedroom’s salt-stained, haunted atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (reek of salt, groaning floorboards) deepen the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (rope as eroding oaths) and subtext (promises meant to dissolve). The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the dialogue crackles with purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original—avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("tongue turned to salt") and nuanced emotion. The dance ritual is ingeniously conceived, not templated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story flawlessly. The brief length feels deliberate, and the theme lingers powerfully. A standout piece.</comment>
