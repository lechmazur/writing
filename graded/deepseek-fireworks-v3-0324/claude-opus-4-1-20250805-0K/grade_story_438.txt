<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her abandonment of astrophysics for genetic engineering, revealing a complex, layered personality. Her actions align with her hollow recklessness, though her 'vague mystic' trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the override action driving momentum and a clear arc from discovery to defiance. Pacing is excellent, though the ethics protocol conflict could be more emphasized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lab's sterile fluorescence contrasts brilliantly with Marina's mystical pursuit. Sensory details (compass needle spinning, bioluminescent proteins) immerse the reader, enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (star charts in DNA, compass pointing inward) and a haunting ending elevate the story. The theme of hereditary horizons is explored with rare depth and originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("constellations in DNA strands") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©. The prose is purposeful, though "discreetly flamboyant" slightly strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about biological frontiers. Only the mystic trait feels underutilized.</comment>
