<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Madame Vesper's cranky yet calculated persona is sharply defined, with motivations clear and actions aligned. Her deception reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is taut and purposeful, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing excels within constraints, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (dust motes, golden light) elevating tension. Setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of sand/bones) and layered subtext. Ending is satisfying but could linger more thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "candid deceit" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with brevity serving the story's intensity. Leaves a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
