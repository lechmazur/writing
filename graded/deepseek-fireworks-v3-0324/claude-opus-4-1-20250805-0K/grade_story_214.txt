<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and poignant, with the sea glass and microfilm reinforcing her existential hunt. Her actions align with her established traits, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the microfilm discovery driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming steel, cosmic shadows) enhancing the atmosphere. The observatory and sea glass are meaningfully connected to the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is masterful, blending symbolism (sea glass as hope) with emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of loss-to-redemption is layered and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors ("electromagnetic ghosts") are fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
