<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldrich's layered desperation and performative nobility are compelling, though his final transformation feels slightly abrupt given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight, cause-and-effect-driven progression; the climax’s inevitability is masterfully seeded early. Minor pacing hiccups near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab’s eerie, unstable atmosphere is visceral and thematically resonant. Sensory details (curling ticket stubs, white flames) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional symbolism (stubs as performed happiness, combustion as truth’s cost). Ending’s emotional weight lingers. Only flaw: a single clunky metaphor ("like swallowing glass").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("a sound like breaking champagne flutes"), no tropes. Nuanced handling of self-deception’s literal/metaphoric heat.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. Length feels deliberate; every detail serves the theme of combustion-as-confession.</comment>
