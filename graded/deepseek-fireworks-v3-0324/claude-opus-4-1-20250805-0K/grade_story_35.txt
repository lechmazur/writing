<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly from discovery to revelation, with tight cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is masterful—quiet urgency lingers without rushing the delicate emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exquisite; the Translation Center and rooftop garden fuse into a liminal space where silence and language collide. Sensory details (birds, silk, earth) are transcendent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Layered symbolism (ravens, seeds, constellations) and restrained prose evoke profound yearning. Ending is open yet satisfying, leaving the reader haunted by the 'language of emotions'.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Deeply original—avoids clichés despite mystical elements. Nuanced handling of silence and longing feels human, not algorithmic. No purple prose; every adjective serves the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion; elements feel inevitable, not imposed. Brief length amplifies the story’s meditative power. Lingers like a half-remembered dream.</comment>
