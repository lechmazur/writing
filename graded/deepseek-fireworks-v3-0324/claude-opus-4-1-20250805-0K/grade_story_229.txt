<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity evolves convincingly into obsession, and her motivation to honor Elena’s request is deeply rooted in their relationship, lending emotional weight to her actions. Her distinct voice emerges through introspective moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect links between Elena’s dying wish, Mara’s research, and the climactic revelation. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, avoiding rush or drag.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ship graveyard and rain-soaked atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story’s themes of loss and cyclical time. Sensory details (humming devices, warm ring box) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (rain as memory) and symbolism (the ring box as a conduit for time). The ending’s emotional resonance and thematic depth linger beyond the final line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-clichéd handling of grief and time. The concept of emotional echoes in rain is strikingly original, and prose avoids purple flourish while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, hauntingly beautiful narrative where every element serves the story’s heart. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reader reflection on letting go.</comment>
