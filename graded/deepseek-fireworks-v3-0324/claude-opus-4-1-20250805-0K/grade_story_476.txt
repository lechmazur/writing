<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's duality as a gentle brawler is compelling, but his motivation to chronicle social changes through spices could be deeper. His actions align with his traits, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the flat tire detail feels tangential. The spice map as a resolution is strong, though the connection to the echo chamber could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber and spice aromas create a vivid atmosphere, but the "demolition hymn" is underutilized. Sensory details excel, especially taste and smell.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional resonance, but the ending's thematic punch could be sharper. The spice metaphor is original, though the guard interaction feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "seasoning the soul"), but "intense nonchalance" repeats awkwardly. Nuanced handling of displacement and memory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the flat tire and echo chamber elements don't fully mesh. Leaves a lingering thought about cultural evolution.</comment>
