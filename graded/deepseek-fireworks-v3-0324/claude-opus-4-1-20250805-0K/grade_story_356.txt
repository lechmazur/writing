<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven around the dial tone's silence, with a clear arc and logical cause-effect relationships, though the tight word limit slightly truncates the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold's atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (rust, chalk dust) and enhances the story's melancholic tone, grounding the cosmic themes in tangible texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (chalk spirals, phone) and subtext; the ending resonates with quiet liberation, and the prose elevates the story beyond its word count.</comment>
