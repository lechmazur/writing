<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rex's transformation from self-preservation to surrender is compelling, though his shift feels slightly rushed in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the typewriter's silence and the fever as pivotal turns. Pacing is expertly managed despite constraints.</comment>
