<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's cautious yet impulsive nature is well-drawn, and his motivation shifts believably from profit to curiosity. The painter's delirium adds depth, though his backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the butterfly's reveal and Marcus's choice serving as a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the painter's lore could use slightly more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drought center's sterile contrast with the butterfly's warmth is vivid. Sensory details (humming computers, the butterfly's vibrations) enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (butterfly as memory) and subtext (empathy vs. data). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Dialogue is spare but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, and the emotional nuance (Marcus's internal conflict) feels authentic. Language is precise without excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout piece with lingering impact.</comment>
