<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tam's skepticism and minstrel background are well-integrated into her cunning and musical method of outwitting Morvex, though her reckless generosity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with clear cause-and-effect, though the steam vent's sudden role as a mechanism feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The disappearing ink factory is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, with sensory details (hissing steam, iridescent scales) enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of subtext (e.g., "giving everything away to gain more"), literary devices, and a memorable, thematically rich ending. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("coins spilling onto cobblestones") and a subversive twist on trickster tropes. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly woven; the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thematic resonance about storytelling and cunning.</comment>
