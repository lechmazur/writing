<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with the broken pencil sharpener, revealing her internal conflict and growth. Her 'voice' is distinct, especially in dialogue with Old Magnus.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the karaoke duet as a surprising but logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the reveal about the hourglass's purpose feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The hourglass marketplace is vividly rendered, with sensory details (sand, songs, chalk lines) enhancing the eerie, melancholic atmosphere. The setting is inseparable from the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sharpener, chalk lines) and a haunting twist elevate the story. The ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant, with minimal exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The karaoke duet as a plot device is fresh, and emotional depth is shown through action and subtext, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact about sacrifice and love. No element is wasted.</comment>
