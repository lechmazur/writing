<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sebastian's motivation is clear and compelling, blending scientific rebellion with ancestral wisdom. His actions align well with his "empirically rebellious" nature, though his dazed state could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from obsession to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax with Professor Morrison feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound garden and dawn setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story’s mystical yet logical tone. Sensory details (chalk dust, wind chimes) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (equations as "flowers of possibility") and thematic depth. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overripe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story’s core theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
