<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses organically from observation to revelation, though the climax (levitation) slightly strains coherence. Pacing masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Celtic-futurist fusion is breathtakingly original. Sensor oaks and floating stone circles create a visceral, immersive atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("bones brittle from shifting realities") offset rare clich√©s ("spirit burned fiercer"). Tone walks the tightrope of poetic precision without purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a singular vision. Length feels expansive, not constrained. Lingers like myth should.</comment>
