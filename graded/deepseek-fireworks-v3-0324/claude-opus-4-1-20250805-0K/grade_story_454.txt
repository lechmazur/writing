<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marco's reckless yet calculated nature is well-developed, and his motivation to prove loyalty is clear. The "rationally emotional" attribute subtly influences his actions, though deeper exploration of his inner conflict would elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the funhouse setting and synchronized alarms driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity. Minor clarity issues around the Dusk Collective's role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and torn map create a rich, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the clown's mouth, mirrors) deepen immersion. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (clover, mirrors) and "jubilant despair" tone lend depth. The ending resonates, though the Collective's significance could be sharper. Shows far more than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "crystallized into acceptance") and an original premise avoid clichés. Some phrases verge on ornate, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. A few logistical questions linger but don’t undercut impact.</comment>
