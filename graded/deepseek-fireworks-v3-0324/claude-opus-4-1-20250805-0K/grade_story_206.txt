<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect relationships (locket discovery → trail of evidence) driving momentum. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (sugar roses, rotting floorboards) immerse the reader. The forgotten market setting enhances both atmosphere and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
