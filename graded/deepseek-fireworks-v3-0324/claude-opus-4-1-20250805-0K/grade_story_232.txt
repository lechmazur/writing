<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to her grandfather's legacy. Her transition from physician to archaeologist is compelling, though her "bleary-eyed" state could be more vividly explored to enhance her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from discovery to resolution. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climactic revelation of the cutlass could be slightly more immersive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Mediterranean setting and digital nomad camp are evocatively rendered, but the "hush of horizon’s edge" feels underutilized. Coffee divination and temple inscriptions are richly connected to the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coffee grounds, cutlass) and subtext (inheritance, obsession). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance of Marina's breakthrough could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The coffee divination method is inventive, though the "dire enchantment" tone occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
