<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Agent Morrow's sheepish yet determined personality and clear motivation to renegotiate with the Leviathan are well-developed, though his "analytically creative" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from introduction to resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the word limit slightly rushes the Leviathan's decision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Pattern Recognition Center and naptime setting create a vivid, ironic atmosphere. Sensory details (prismatic shadows, rumbling laughter) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (symbolism in the lamp, subtext about human laziness), the story evokes thought and emotion. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of bureaucratic satire and cosmic horror feels fresh, with nuanced emotion and distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, the story leverages its elements artfully. It lingers in the mind, suggesting deeper themes about creativity and obligation.</comment>
