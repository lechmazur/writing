<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste's "lukewarm mage" status is well-explored, driving her actions with understated defiance. Her motivation is clear, rooted in loss and hope, though her backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly paced, with the clash escalating naturally. The spore-driven resolution is inventive but slightly rushed; the word limit constraints show in the abrupt shift in Reeves' stance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lunar base and Earth's haunting presence are vividly rendered. Sensory details (e.g., "burnt pearl," "ghost dancers") immerse the reader, though the artificial atmosphere generator's hum feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doormat as hope, spores as rebellion) and layered subtext elevate this. The ending lingers, though Reeves' sudden alignment could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("charred serenity") and originality in blending sci-fi and magic. Minor quibble: "loyally peculiar" risks feeling contrived in repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole. The brief length serves the story’s urgency, though a tad more space for Reeves’ change of heart would strengthen cohesion.</comment>
