<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and deeply personal, her actions align with her grandmother's legacy, and her shift from apprehension to resolve is compelling. However, her "archer" aspect feels underutilized beyond the bow's symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly paced, with a clear arc. The breadcrumbs-to-revelation structure works well, though the climax (virus arrow) leans slightly too neat for the weight of its implications.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—cyberpunk mysticism and holographic mourning create a vivid, immersive world. The Festival of Lost Code is a standout detail that elevates the setting beyond genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact, layered symbolism (candle, balloons), and a resonant theme. The ending is poignant, though the drone's dialogue edges toward didacticism in an otherwise "show-don't-tell" narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The AI sacrifice twist subverts expectations, and the prose is evocative without being purple. Slight over-reliance on "cycles of compassion" as a mantra.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the ending lingers. Minor deduct for the archer's role being more archetypal than deeply explored.</comment>
