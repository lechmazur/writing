<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Baron's off-grid survivalist background and sudden shift to archiving are compelling but could use deeper introspection to solidify his motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from discovery to commitment, though the raft detail feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vividly rendered, blending life/death imagery seamlessly with the story's themes. Sensory details are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (symbolism of bottles, subtext on preservation) and a resonant ending. Dialogue via sign language is inventive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "luminous doubt"). Avoids clich√©s but could polish Baron's internal voice further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, though the raft moment slightly disrupts focus. Leaves a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
