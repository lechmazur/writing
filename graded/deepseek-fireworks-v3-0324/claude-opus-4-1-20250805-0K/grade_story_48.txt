<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The desert wanderer's motivation and personality are deeply interwoven with her past and present, revealing layers through her actions and observations. Her "authentically artificial" attribute is compellingly executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around her research, with a clear arc from loss to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the pirate subplot feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—space and desert sensibilities merge seamlessly. Sensory details (nebula-light, brass warmth) heighten the atmosphere, grounding the cosmic in the tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors (love as gravitational pull), symbolism (ruler as lineage), and subtext (loss vs. persistence) resonate. The ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original voice, no clichés. "Translated love" is a fresh lens; emotional nuance is shown, not stated. Avoids AI pitfalls like abrupt jumps or over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly—researching love via piracy and astrophysics feels organic. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving a lingering meditation on connection.</comment>
