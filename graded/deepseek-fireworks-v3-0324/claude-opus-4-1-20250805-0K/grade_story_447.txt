<question>1</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Martha’s motivation is clear, layered, and deeply integrated with her role as a gossip columnist. Her "dutifully defiant" nature and the stuffed toy ear reveal poignant emotional depth and consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The deterioration of the ear and its prophetic function create a cohesive arc that resolves satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The "amber prison" setting is evocative and thematically rich. Sensory details (steam, fraying threads) enhance the atmosphere, grounding the speculative elements in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling. The self-fulfilling prophecies and Martha’s confession elevate the narrative into a meditation on hope and agency. Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The premise avoids clichés, and the prose is precise yet lyrical. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors (e.g., amber prison as both literal and symbolic) stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, profound story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance about the power of belief and narrative.</comment>
