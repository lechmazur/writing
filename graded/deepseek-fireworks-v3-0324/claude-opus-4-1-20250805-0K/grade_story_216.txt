<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira Chen's depth as a scapegoat is compelling; her motivations align perfectly with her profession and the story's themes. Her transformation feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the washer's revelation serving as a masterful climax. Pacing is meticulous, though the final act slightly rushes the metaphysical resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stratos is vividly rendered, its floating grandeur mirroring Mira's existential weightlessness. Sensory details (e.g., "frost-like voice," "gleaming towers") are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The story’s craftsmanship is near-flawless: layered symbolism, evocative prose, and a hauntingly ambiguous ending. Only the cryptic caller's lack of backstory slightly diminishes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality shines; the washer-as-lens metaphor is fresh, and Mira’s role subverts tropes. Nuanced emotions ("robustly delicate") avoid AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for contemplation. Only the library card’s relevance could be stronger.</comment>
