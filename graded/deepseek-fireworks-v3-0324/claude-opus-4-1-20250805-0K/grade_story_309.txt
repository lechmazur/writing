<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's cynical, exhausted demeanor is vividly portrayed, and his motivation—solving Sarah's murder before retirement—is compelling. However, his "confidently unsure" trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the Queen of Hearts revelation as a powerful pivot. Pacing is excellent, though the leap to "wrong fire" could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gallery’s ruined, dreamlike atmosphere amplifies Marcus's unraveling sanity. Sensory details (ash, fractured light) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (kaleidoscope = fractured memories). The ending’s resigned sarcasm is haunting. Only minor nit: "molten sarcasm" slightly overexplains tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "morgue of modern art"). Subtle emotional beats elevate it above formulaic noir tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering unease.</comment>
