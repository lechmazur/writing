<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his artistic nature, though his "subjectively rational" task could be more sharply defined to avoid slight ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and purposeful, with the Polaroid excavation driving revelations logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's pivot to "endless day" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the sky-lounge's surreal setting amplifying the thematic tension between freedom and constraint. Sensory details (obsidian table, velvet lounge) are deftly deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (broken watch, serpentine city) and layered subtext. The ending satisfies while leaving room for contemplation. Only minor quibble: "laconic exuberance" could be more consistently embodied in the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The minstrel's voice feels distinct, and the conceit of photograph-as-map is fresh. Only a hint of over-formality in phrases like "urban mathematics."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a haunting impression of cyclical infinity. The length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
