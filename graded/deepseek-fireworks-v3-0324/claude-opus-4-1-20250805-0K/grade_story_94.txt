<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina is vividly realized, with her motivations and contradictions (heartbreak counselor yet heartbreaker) lending depth. Her voice and actions align seamlessly with her temporal femme fatale role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pool serving as a cohesive anchor for the temporal chaos. Pacing balances introspection and action, though the word limit slightly truncates the client’s resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky reflection pool is a masterstroke of atmospheric worldbuilding—evocative, thematically resonant, and richly sensory. The setting amplifies the story’s melancholy and grandeur.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (gravity of desires, cage of illusions) and symbolism (amber earrings). The ending lingers with haunting ambiguity, and the prose is precise yet lyrical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Remarkably original—subverts tropes (femme fatale as counselor) and delivers fresh imagery (cloud trails across time). No clichés; emotions are nuanced and shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader pondering desire’s paradoxes.</comment>
