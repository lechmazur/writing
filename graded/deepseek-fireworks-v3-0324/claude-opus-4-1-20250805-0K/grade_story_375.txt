<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with a clear but nuanced alignment between her "smiling" demeanor and underlying fury. The "saboteur" aspect is creatively subverted, adding depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to transformation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the cause-effect logic of the mannequins' role in "progress" is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city is rendered with immersive sensory detail, and the setting amplifies the story's themes of decay and rebirth. The gorge and rusted walkways heighten the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (e.g., cracked mannequins as vessels for stellar wrath) and a layered theme ("perfection as the enemy of truth") elevate this beyond surface narrative. The ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice. No clich√©s; the star's "creative wrath" and mannequins' static poetry feel uniquely inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about beauty in brokenness.</comment>
