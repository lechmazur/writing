<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong alignment between Kael's stubbornness and his pivotal decision to reverse the ritual. His motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped in terms of backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the gondola confrontation serving as a clever climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of mist, mountains, and the gondola to heighten tension. The flute's grotesque details deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flute, tooth marks) and a resonant theme of redemption. The ending lingers with philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh twist on parallel selves and forensic spiritualism. Minor overuse of "shadow-self" phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh seamlessly; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question about self-forgiveness.</comment>
