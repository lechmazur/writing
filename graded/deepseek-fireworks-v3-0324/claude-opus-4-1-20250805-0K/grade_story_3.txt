<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's motivations and methods are vividly portrayed, with his "serenely frantic" demeanor and knot-work divination revealing depth. His voice is distinct, though his backstory with Grimwald could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the riddle and yarn divination, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are clear, though the pacing could linger a touch longer on the crow's revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sailor's graveyard and autumnal transition are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (creaking gates, November fog) heightening the mood. The setting and object (yarn) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (knots as constellations, yarn as infinity) are masterful, and the theme of cyclical markets/death is poignant. The ending is satisfying, though the "dignified chaos" motif could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of economic and cosmic themes, but occasional phrases ("serenely frantic") verge on overwrought. The metaphors feel fresh, and the tone avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, with the yarn and graveyard serving the theme elegantly. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of cyclical fate.</comment>
