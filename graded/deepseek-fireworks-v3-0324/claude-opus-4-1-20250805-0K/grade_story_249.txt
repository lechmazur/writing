<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transition from vigilante to nostalgia collector is compelling, though his "lazily ambitious" trait could be more sharply defined. His motivation is clear, but his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly with a clear arc, though the word limit slightly rushes Samuel's revelation. The lure tactic is clever and coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., the fountain weeping "something sweeter") elevating the mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the drill, the fountain) and subtext (resilience as bending with purpose). The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The antique drill as a nostalgia tool is inventive, though the "hidden whimsy" tone occasionally verges on twee.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that feels deliberate in its brevity. Leaves the reader with a sense of melancholy wonder.</comment>
