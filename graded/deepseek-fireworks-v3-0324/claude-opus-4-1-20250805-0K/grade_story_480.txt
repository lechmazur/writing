<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus Chen’s motivation is clear and compelling, blending existential curiosity with professional detachment. His "quietly loud" approach to digital erasure adds depth, though his emotional range could be broader.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the receipt as a subtle yet powerful driver. The resolution subverts expectations elegantly, though the club infiltration feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and dying fluorescent lights create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the dumpster-hidden club immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (receipt as breadcrumb) and subtext (chosen invisibility). The ending lingers, though the dialogue could carry more weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("whispers, echoes") and nuanced handling of disappearance elevate this. Minor stumbles in avoiding tropes (e.g., "digital ghosts" risks cliché).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with brevity serving the theme. The story thrives on restraint, leaving room for reader interpretation.</comment>
