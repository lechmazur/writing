<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Enzo's motivation is clear and compelling; his swashbuckler past contrasts poignantly with his present. The hatpin and marbles reveal depth, though his "fervent apathy" could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the marbles' function feels slightly contrived. The ending resonates, though Chen's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details like "wet circuitry" and "neon-soaked" enhancing the cyberpunk grit. The storm's aftermath is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact and thematic depth ("kindness as rebellion"). The hatpin's symbolism works, but the marbles' glow leans toward gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("a tiny sword against an ocean of darkness"). Minimal clich√©s, though "broken dreams" is overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the marbles' logic could be tighter.</comment>
