<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong portrayal of the ranger's cursed gift, with clear motivation and distinct voice, though slight over-reliance on internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful structure with a resonant arc. The pause concept elevates the plot, but the scale's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—dandelions and dew are masterfully tied to theme. Only minor nit: birthing hut could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft. Symbolism (scale, seeds) and subtext ("too honest for their constructed world") are piercing. Ending lingers perfectly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, but "feral" label risks cliché. Metaphors (dew, receipts) are fresh, though "hope within truth's harsh edges" verges on purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and haunting. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Word count feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
