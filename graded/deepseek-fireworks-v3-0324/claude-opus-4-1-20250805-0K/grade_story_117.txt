<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's "wisely foolish" nature is subtly but effectively portrayed, and her motivation to discover the power of self-expression is clear. However, her backstory (e.g., her grandmother's phrase) feels slightly underexplored for deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured, with a clear arc from pursuit to revelation. The trail of notes and the piano's transformation are imaginative drivers. Pacing is tight yet unhurried, though the ending could linger slightly more for impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted cellar and shifting realities are rendered with vivid sensory detail. The atmosphere is immersive and supports the theme perfectly. Only minor nitpicks—e.g., more tactile descriptions of the moss-covered keys would heighten immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Richly layered with metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the cracked lens as a conduit for perception). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant. Some phrases verge on over-poetic, but the craft is otherwise impeccable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors (mushroom keys, mosaic realities), and a distinct voice. Only a single line ("fear was just excitement wearing a disguise") feels slightly trite.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative flawlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering wistfulness. Minor deduction for the rushed transition into the cellar's transformation.</comment>
