<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viktor Zhao's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his mentor, but his "foreign features" feel underdeveloped as a tension point. His relentless pursuit is compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. The reveal of the endless quest is well-executed, though the word limit slightly rushes Chen's reaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hydroponic farm is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., gurgling water, synthetic leaves). The atmosphere enhances the mystery and Viktor's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism (chess, roots as neural networks) and subtext (the futility of seeking). The ending lingers, though the "agonizing bliss" refrain borders on overuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "delightfully dull" feels slightly forced. The prose is stylish without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The brevity feels deliberate, though the xenophobia subplot could be more nuanced.</comment>
