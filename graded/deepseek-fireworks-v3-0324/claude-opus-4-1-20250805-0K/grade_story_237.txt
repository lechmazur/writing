<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's desperation and Kaine's enigmatic insight are sharply drawn, but Vera's shift from piracy to unlocking his cell feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent arc with a resonant resolution. Pacing balances urgency and revelation well, though the curse's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brig’s metallic ambiance and cosmic decay are vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's haunting playfulness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (love vs. time), symbolic dice, and a layered ending elevate this beyond its word count. Only minor nit: Kaine’s exposition leans slightly heavy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh twists on tropes (e.g., pirate hearts hidden "behind the treasure") and a distinctive voice. Minimal AI telltales.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless microcosm: elements serve theme, style enchants, and the ending lingers.</comment>
