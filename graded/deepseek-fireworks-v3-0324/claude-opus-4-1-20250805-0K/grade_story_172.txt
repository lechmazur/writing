<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and nuanced, but her transition from guide to hero feels slightly abrupt. Her "unsettled" nature is well-explored, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the prophecy's mechanics could be more explicitly foreshadowed. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The seashell setting is vividly atmospheric, but its connection to architectural secrets feels underdeveloped. Sensory details are strong but selective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sharp prose with effective symbolism (puzzle box, shell). Ending resonates, though the "heroic" twist risks feeling contrived. Themes are layered and memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Some phrases ("sharp gentleness") border on overly poetic, but avoid clich√©. Emotional subtext is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly; the brief length enhances urgency. Only minor quibbles with logic (e.g., shell's sudden glow). Lingers provocatively.</comment>
