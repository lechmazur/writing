<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, his actions consistent with his trauma. The prayer bead subtly reinforces his transformation from academic to operative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with Marcus's double agenda revealed organically. The funhouse mirror's role as an intelligence tool is inventive but slightly strained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned airport is hauntingly vivid. "Screaming silence" and phantom announcements amplify the war's erasure of normalcy. Sensory details (coffee cup, bead clicks) ground the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional layering: prayer beads as tech, clumsiness as strategy. Ending delivers a chilling resolution without exposition. Theme of sacred-to-tactical resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice avoids tropes. The mirror's warping as surveillance is fresh, though the "artfully clumsy" descriptor feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Every element serves the narrative's emotional and thematic weight. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
