<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's solemnity and Yuki's endearing persistence are vividly depicted, with motivations and actions aligning seamlessly. Their distinct voices and reactions to the key reveal deep character layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled around the key's discovery, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. Pacing is deftly handled, though the shed's reveal hints at slight compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk-garden contrast is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (neon, synthetic soil) enriching the atmosphere. The setting amplifies themes of authenticity and isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and layered, with potent symbolism (the key, letters). Dialogue feels organic, and the ending lingers. Subtext about human connection elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("x-out real apples") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©s. The stylistic blend of cyberpunk and pastoral feels original, with no AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate vignette where elements serve the theme. The brevity feels purposeful, leaving a poignant aftertaste about overlooked connections.</comment>
