<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his history with Tommy, but his shiftiness as a caretaker feels underexplored. The microscope as a symbol of their bond is strong, but his transition to tailing circus caravans could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but slightly rushed in the circus revelation. The parole hearing’s final word ("Supervision") ties well to the ending, but the circus's role feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in setting is evocative and enhances the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details (flapping screen, phosphorescent dust) are vivid, but the circus's surrealism risks overshadowing the primary setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact with layered symbolism (microscope, circus). The theme of flawed redemption is poignant, though the ending’s hope slightly clashes with the anguished joy tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The circus alchemists are fresh, but Marcus’s caretaker role feels generic. Nuanced emotions, though "anguished joy" could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, but the circus’s introduction needs more grounding. Lingers thematically.</comment>
