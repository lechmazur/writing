<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause/effect. The surreal twist (temporal rewinding) is handled deftly, though slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and layered themes. The ending is poignant, and the "joyful despair" tone lingers. The story thrums with emotional and philosophical weight.</comment>
