<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with clear motivation, though his "mellow" nature could be deeper explored. His use of the ruler as a conductor's baton is inspired.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from preparation to transformation. The overload conflict resolves organically.</comment>
