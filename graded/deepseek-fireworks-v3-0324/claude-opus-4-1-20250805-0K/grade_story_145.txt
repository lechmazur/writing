<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending past trauma with a philosophical mission. Her "uncertainly certain" mindset adds depth, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly wound around Mara's ritual, with logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is brisk but manages a full arc. The echo test’s mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is lush and immersive, with the library’s hidden chamber serving as both setting and symbol. Sensory details (rosebud’s cut, copper’s song) are expertly deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the rosebud’s symbolism, the theme of empathy as rebellion, and the ending’s quiet triumph resonate deeply. Subtext ("practical calculation despite fantastic circumstances") elevates it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The alchemical rosebud and "folded reality" are inventive. Nuanced emotion ("uncertainly certain") and stylistic consistency stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious microcosm. Elements serve the story’s philosophical core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about empathy’s cost.</comment>
