<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and deeply rooted in her role as a critical midwife. Her actions and revelations align perfectly with her growing wisdom and disillusionment with tradition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the diaries serving as a catalyst for Elara’s defiance. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard island and its parasitic symbiosis with stolen memories create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ash, herbs, maelstrom) deepen the eerie dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herbs as vessels, the withering orchard) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The concept of memory-stealing orchards is fresh, and the prose avoids AI telltales (purple prose, abrupt shifts).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of tradition.</comment>
