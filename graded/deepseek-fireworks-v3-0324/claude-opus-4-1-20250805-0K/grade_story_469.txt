<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a "cartographer of the abandoned" is clear and compelling, though his "blameless smuggler" label could be more explicitly explored. His logical yet emotional responses add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The countdown structure creates taut pacing, and the plot's cause-and-effect logic is impeccable. The resolution feels earned, though the tight word limit slightly truncates the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and jasmine scent are masterfully woven into the atmosphere, enhancing tension and Marcus's connection to the past. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (the key, the whispers) and subtext (survival as art) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, though the "grandiose modesty" tone occasionally verges on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "mapping darkness, breathing jasmine"). Minor AI-like phrasing ("logical understanding that emotion was...") is rare.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with haunting questions about forgotten spaces.</comment>
