<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her heritage, and her nimble locksmith skills align well with her task. Her "jaded wonder" adds nuance, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with urgency from the falling leaf and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the metaphysical locks could be more explicitly explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating orchard is a stunning, evocative setting that enhances the story's magic. Sensory details (saltwater, apple blossom tears) deepen immersion. A near-perfect blend of concept and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (colonial erasure, cultural preservation) and literary craft. The ending is purposeful, though the "storm of secrets" metaphor feels slightly overplayed. Show-don’t-tell is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("tumblers of reality"), and nuanced emotion. The physically metaphysical locks and dancing key are ingenious. Authentic voice throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the theme seamlessly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting resonance. A standout example of compressed storytelling.</comment>
