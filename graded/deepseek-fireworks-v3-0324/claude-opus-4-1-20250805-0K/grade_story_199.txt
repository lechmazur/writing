<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mika's obsessive documentation and devotion to her grandmother’s legacy are distinct and compelling, but her "overzealous" nature could be further explored to deepen her voice and emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's progression from Mika’s routines to divine revelation is cohesive and surprising, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the goddess’s introduction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s eerie, dreamless atmosphere is vividly rendered, with concrete details (apple trees growing from highway bones) elevating the surreal tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original execution with fresh metaphors (e.g., "script that looked familiarly unknown"), avoiding clichés despite the mythic premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where every element serves the central theme of finding divinity in emptiness. The brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
