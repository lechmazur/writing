<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from librarian to prophet is deeply nuanced. Her "softly militant" hands and persistence with the spyglass reveal a compelling evolution, though her late-blooming heroism could be more explicitly tied to her past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s progression is tight and purposeful, with the spyglass serving as both catalyst and metaphor. Pacing is strong, though Marcus’s subplot feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radioactive wind, whispering corn, and salt-stained lens create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. The rooftop farm is a brilliant contrast to the ruins below, grounding the cosmic theme in tangible decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spyglass as grief’s lens) and subtext (loss as dark matter). The ending resonates with philosophical weight, though Elara’s "sorrow and satisfaction" could be rendered with more subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original—grief’s physics is a fresh conceit. Language is precise yet lyrical, avoiding cliché. Only minor quibble: "quantum foam" risks leaning slightly into jargon.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity amplifies impact, and the story lingers long after reading. The rooftop farm’s symbolism might benefit from a tad more texture.</comment>
