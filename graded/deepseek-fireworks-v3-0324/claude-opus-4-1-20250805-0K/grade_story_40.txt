<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus' backstory and current role as a goldfish caretaker are well-developed, with clear motivation rooted in guilt. His "tentatively fierce" nature is consistent and revealed through actions and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly paced, with the weather-driven encounter serving as a logical catalyst. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten recipe library and aquarium create a rich, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "spines cracking like arthritic knuckles") deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (toy soldier, goldfish) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the dialogue feels natural while advancing theme and character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic voice, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced handling of guilt and redemption, though the "haunting echo" phrasing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful, with elements serving the story elegantly. Leaves a lingering reflection on second chances.</comment>
