<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, with layered rebellion and preservation tied to her grandmother's legacy. Her actions and voice are distinct, though her "even-tempered" trait could be more dynamically shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc. The exchange feels slightly rushed, but cause/effect logic holds. "Offload" action drives momentum effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and enhances mood—abandoned carnival's decay mirrors forgotten knowledge. Sensory details (moonlight, dusty prizes) deepen atmosphere and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: symbolism (scarf, constellations), subtext (preservation vs. order), and evocative prose. Ending lingers with thematic resonance. Only minor nitpicks in dialogue subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés. Fresh metaphors ("psychic white noise"), nuanced emotion, and a风格 that feels uniquely voiced. No AI-generic flaws detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce masterfully. Brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. The story’s depth and cohesion suggest publishable quality.</comment>
