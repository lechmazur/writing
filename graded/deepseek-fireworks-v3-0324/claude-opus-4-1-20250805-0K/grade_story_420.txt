<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her artistic crisis and breakthrough, though her "excited boredom" could be fleshed out more to avoid slight abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from failure to transformation. The implosion motif drives the narrative elegantly, though the light-boundary conceit feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum setting and fossil textures are vividly rendered, creating a haunting atmosphere that mirrors Marina’s internal journey. Sensory details (light, ring’s warmth, tuning fork) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ring, light, bark) and subtext (compression vs. expansion). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though the dialogue absence is notable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("galaxy collapsing") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés, though "excited boredom" skirts pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements seamlessly integrated. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on artistic density.</comment>
