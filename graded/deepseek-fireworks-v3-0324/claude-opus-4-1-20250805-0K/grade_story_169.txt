<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a soul-broker is clear and compelling, though the composer's eagerness to trade his essence could use slightly more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and cohesive, with a clear arc from introduction to resolution, though the pacing near the contract-signing feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating tea platform and recycling center create a vivid, immersive contrastâ€”weirdly static and industrial chaos are masterfully juxtaposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fermented silence"). Only minor quibble: Marcus's "rehearsed surprise" could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant vignette where every element serves the theme of artistic obsession. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
