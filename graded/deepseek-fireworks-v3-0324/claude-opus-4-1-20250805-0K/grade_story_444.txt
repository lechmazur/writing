<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambassador Vera's motivation is compelling and deeply personal, blending diplomatic duty with maternal grief. Her fierce yet fragile demeanor is vividly portrayed, though her "methodically playful" trait could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's time-loop structure is expertly woven, with clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is tight yet immersive, though the resolution of "transforming illusions" feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is hauntingly atmospheric, with ethereal sensory details (e.g., "dreams leaked like oil"). The ghost costume's symbolism elevates the setting to a psychological landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext and layered metaphors (e.g., the costume as "diplomatic banner") create lingering impact. The ending's thematic pivot—from dispelling illusions to bridging time—is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with no clichés. The fusion of surrealism and emotional depth feels genuinely human, though the "calm frenzy" tone occasionally wavers into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The brief length feels deliberate, and every element serves the story’s haunting meditation on grief and time.</comment>
