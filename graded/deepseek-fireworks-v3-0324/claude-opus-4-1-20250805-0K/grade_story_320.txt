<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's shyness and divination skills are well-integrated, but her motivation to "right a cosmic imbalance" could be more deeply explored. Her actions align, but her internal conflict feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The parallel timelines are handled deftly, though the resolution feels slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater market is vividly rendered, and the parallel timelines enhance the atmosphere. Sensory details (algae, bio-membrane phone) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (pearls, photographs) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the social media element slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, though the "cosmic imbalance" trope risks cliché. The prose avoids excess ornamentation, but a few phrases ("passionate disinterest") feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The elements coalesce brilliantly. The brevity serves the story’s urgency, leaving a haunting aftertaste of choice and regret.</comment>
