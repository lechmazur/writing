<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect logic driving toward the climactic "throb." Pacing balances backstory and present action deftly within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Steampunk dining hall is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hissing pipes, faded stickers) reinforcing atmosphere and character history. Setting feels inseparable from revenge.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: symbolism (stickers as childhood/mapping), layered themes (erasure vs. resonance), and a haunting ending that lingers. Subtext elevates every word.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Refreshingly original premise; avoids tropes. "Hyperactively serene" and "savage grace" are human contradictions, not AI-generated. Emotional nuance feels authentic.</comment>
