<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dr. Collective and Torres are vividly drawn, with motivations deeply tied to the story's themes, but Torres' hollow-eyed fatigue could be more explicitly linked to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect, though the temporal training room's rules could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The facility's eerie, cerebral atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with candle wax and charger plug details grounding the surreal in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (wax codes, charger plug) and subtext; the ending lingers with haunting ambiguity and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept, avoiding clich√©s; only minor quibble is the slightly overused "merry bitterness" motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a story that feels deliberate and expansive despite its brevity.</comment>
