<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kane's backstory and internal conflict are vividly rendered, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His reactions to the photograph reveal depth, though his transition could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The castle and seed-planting season create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (smoke, flooded fields) immerse the reader, and the setting enhances Kane’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craftsmanship—symbolism (photograph, seeds), subtext (cycles of violence), and a resonant ending. The prose elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Metaphors ("corroded rapture") are fresh, and emotion is shown, not told. Minor stiffness in Kane’s reflection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about redemption, with no sense of word-count limitation.</comment>
