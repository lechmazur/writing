<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her methodical, almost ritualistic actions. Her distinct 'voice' emerges through her quiet rebellion against the comet's devastation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hermit's actions driving a clear arc from devastation to tentative revival. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive, and cause-effect logic is flawless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet-scorched sky are rendered with haunting sensory detail. The setting is inseparable from the hermit's mission, amplifying the story's eerie, resilient mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (weathervane, pressed flowers) and subtext (destruction as instruction). The ending lingers with quiet hope, and the prose elevates the story’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The comet’s aftermath and the hermit’s scientific-poetic approach feel fresh. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, and metaphors are precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful blend of elements. The brevity feels intentional, and the story resonates long after reading. Every detail serves the narrative’s depth.</comment>
