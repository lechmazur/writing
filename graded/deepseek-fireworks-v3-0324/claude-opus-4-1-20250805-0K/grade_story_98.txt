<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's trembling sentinel role and obsession with decoding tapestries despite fear create a compelling paradox. His motivation is clear, but his voice lacks deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s tight structure leverages the morning timeframe and ruler-as-key device elegantly. Pacing is sharp, though the climax’s reveal feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dog park subterfuge and tapestry-lit chamber merge seamlessly. Sensory details (plastic ruler’s sweat, terrier’s bark) amplify the clandestine atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (ruler as boundary-measurer) and subtext (security’s illusion). Ending resonates, but some thematic depth is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original twist on secret-society tropes. Marcus’s cowardice-as-strength angle feels fresh. Minor quibble: "patient observer" phrase verges on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly, with the ruler and timeframe elevating the premise. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about hidden knowledge’s ethics.</comment>
