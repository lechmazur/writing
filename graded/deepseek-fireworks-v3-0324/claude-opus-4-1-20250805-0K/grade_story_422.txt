<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's selective mutism and ventriloquism are deeply integrated into her character, revealing her emotional barriers and optimism through Chester. Her motivation to archive weather patterns is clear and drives the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with phone calls serving as unexpected but logical catalysts. The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, though the parallel universe elements could benefit from slightly more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly rendered with sensory details (purple sand, twin moons). The setting enhances the story's surreal tone and Marina's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, using symbolism (coffee sleeves as archives) and subtext (family redefined). The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue (via Chester) is purposeful and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the writing style is distinctive. The only minor flaw is occasional over-reliance on surrealism, which risks distancing the reader.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brief length works in its favor, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
