<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's momentum is tightly driven by the amber's symbolism and the healer's revelation. Despite the brevity, the arc from hunting to letting go feels organic, though the rumor chains could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral’s ruin-turned-canvas is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling. Sensory details (hissing spray paint, gold-edged murals) deepen the themes of redemption and contrast war’s scars with art’s resilience.</comment>
