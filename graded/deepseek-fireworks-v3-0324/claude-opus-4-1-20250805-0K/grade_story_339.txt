<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's guilt and motivation are sharply defined, with her actions and internal conflict revealing depth. The drawer knob as a symbol of guilt is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from guilt to confession. The seesaw as a narrative device is clever, though the resolution via social media feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prismatic lake and construction site create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (the seesaw's squeak, the worn brass) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and literary craft. Symbolism (the knob, the seesaw) and subtext elevate it, though the ending’s lightness could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Marina’s nuanced guilt and the specificity of the drawer knob stand out. Only minor over-reliance on "gray" as a metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about redemption.</comment>
