<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji's distracted nature and "normally weird" attribute are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, but his transformation into a "reluctant catalyst" could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and effective pacing. The infiltration mission drives the narrative, though the escalator blind spot feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cyberpunk alley and data vault are vividly rendered, with sensory details that immerse the reader. The setting enhances both action and theme, though the timeframe ("standstill of a broken escalator") is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., "fractured illusions" as symbolism) and subtext about corporate control. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could resonate more sharply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of cyberpunk and artisanal rebellion, though some phrases (e.g., "neon-soaked alley") edge toward genre cliché. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, with creative integration of assigned components. The brevity feels deliberate, though the story’s depth slightly outpaces its length.</comment>
