<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s reclusive nature and creative profession are vividly drawn, with clear motivation and growth. His "shadowboxing" with isolation feels authentic, though his transformation could use slightly more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s surreal logic (carnival-as-metaphor) is coherent and compelling, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Pacing is strong, with a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the clock tower and phantom carnival merge seamlessly into a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (shimmering ticket, charcoal sketches) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craftsmanship: layered symbolism (ticket as escape/belonging), resonant theme, and a satisfying ending. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Literary devices are deftly deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("metaphysically physical," "near distance"). Avoids clichés; emotions are shown, not told. Only minor quibble: the carnival trope skirts predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant story where elements serve the narrative flawlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on vulnerability and connection.</comment>
