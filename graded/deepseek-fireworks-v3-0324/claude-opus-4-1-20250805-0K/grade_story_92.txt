<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is subtly clear—his unflinching nature and acceptance of the supernatural align with his blood-drive encounter. His 'carefully careless' demeanor adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with eerie coherence, from the blood-drive origin to the whispered flowers. Pacing is tight, and cause-effect is seamless despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mansion's gothic atmosphere is immersive and purposeful, with sensory details (amber glow, mastiffs' silence) amplifying the uncanny. Graveyard flowers deepen the dread.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of blood, glass-sealed blooms) are masterful. The ending lingers with haunting subtext. Dialogue is sparse but razor-sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the Blackwood estate's twisted elegance. No clichés—just fresh horrors (blooming specimens, whispering portraits). Language is precise, not purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's eerie cohesion. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a chilling aftertaste. Creative and unsettling.</comment>
