<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessalion's motivation is clear and his 'voice' distinct, though his cosmic role risks overshadowing his bardic traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive and paced well, with solar winds as both literal and figurative drivers. Minor abruptness in the keeper's shift to awe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—crystalline panels, starlight keeper, and comet-tail lyre merge seamlessly into a vivid, immersive cosmos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Layered symbolism (leaves as repair codes) and a resonant ending elevate this beyond mere whimsy. Dialogue occasionally over-expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors (entropy's "maiden sigh") and zero clichés. Only a hint of over-formality in Thessalion's speech.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a gemlike whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving thematic echoes about art's cosmic purpose.</comment>
