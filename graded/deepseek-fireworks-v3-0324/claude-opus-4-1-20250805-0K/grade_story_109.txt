<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from emotional detachment to artistic realization is skillfully rendered. His motivation—collecting folk remedies—ties beautifully to his backstory, giving depth to his cold exterior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly compressed, with the mitten serving as a catalyst for Marcus's internal shift. Coherence is strong, though the transition from operative to artist could be slightly more developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted—cold, clandestine, yet poetic. Sensory details (frost, dried herbs) deepen immersion, and the setting reinforces the theme of fragmented identities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft. Symbolism (altars as art, remedies as poetry) elevates the story, and the ending resonates with quiet power. Subtext about sacrifice and memory is richly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original. The fusion of espionage and folk art feels fresh, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told, and the prose avoids excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of brevity and depth. Elements serve the story organically, and the ending lingers. The constraints feel like artistic choices, not limitations.</comment>
