<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her role and history. Her "anxiously relaxed" state and the porcelain mask reveal a complex character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marina's rebellion. The "kilter" action is well-executed, though the cosmic blink feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile leaf classification office contrasts powerfully with the birds' freedom. Sensory details (porcelain shards, marble reflections) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mask, birds, chaos) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, though the cosmic blink could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing. The braided bitterness tone is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers.</comment>
