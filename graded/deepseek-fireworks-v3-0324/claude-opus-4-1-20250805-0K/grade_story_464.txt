<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's sass and academic mischief are vividly portrayed, driving her actions consistently. Her voice is distinct, though her backstory (e.g., MIT) feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (fracturing reality) could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (e.g., "impossible colors," "hummed with suppressed dreams"). The twilight timeframe enhances the malleable dimensional barriers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., chaos as a "secret ingredient"). The ending is satisfying and thematic. Subtext about order vs. chaos elevates the story beyond surface action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The culinary-meets-metaphysical premise is fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "season this bland existence") are inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of chaos. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
