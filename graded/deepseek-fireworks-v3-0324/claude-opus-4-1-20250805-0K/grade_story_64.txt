<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear, nuanced, and drive the plot. Her "technically wild" approach to alchemy is consistent and reveals her outsider status and moral growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from accusation to resolution. Pacing is effective, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the dragon reveal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating marketplace and coded scuffs create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the scale's warmth) enrich the world and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (scale, scuffs) and subtext ("mundane miracles"). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, leaving a lasting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The dragon's role and the "mundane miracles" concept feel fresh. Language is purposeful, not overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth and emotional weight.</comment>
