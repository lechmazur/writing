<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her rebellion against the Consortium. Her actions—jabbering, breeding chaos—reveal a nuanced character driven by both hope and spite.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Mara’s actions (planting, sending messages) driving toward a clear resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story’s mood. Sensory details (ghostly wheat, salt-crusted shores) immerse the reader beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and symbolism (the deck of cards, the song of boundaries), the story evokes emotional resonance and leaves a haunting impression. The ending is purposeful and memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a unique voice. Avoids clichés, and the emotional nuance (raw solace) feels authentic, not AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering theme of rebellion is potent.</comment>
