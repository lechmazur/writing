<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's motivation is vividly clear, and her rebellion against predictable miracles reveals a profound internal conflict. Her voice is distinct, but minor refinement in emotional depth could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from imprisonment to liberation. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the beach could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating library is brilliantly realized, blending myth and reality. Sensory details (e.g., the shell's coldness) deepen immersion, though the "breathing shelves" could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (miracles as prison) and symbolism (the shell). The ending is hauntingly satisfying, with layered themes of freedom vs. certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering question: Can true hope exist without risk?</comment>
