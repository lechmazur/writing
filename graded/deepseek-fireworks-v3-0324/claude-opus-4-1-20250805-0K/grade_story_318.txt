<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's aloofness and detachment are well-developed, and her motivation shifts convincingly from halfhearted to deeply committed. The wooden spoon serves as a powerful symbol of her emotional breakthrough.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the 72-hour deadline adding urgency. The resolution feels earned and organic, despite the word limit. Cause-and-effect is clear, and pacing is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Memory Crystal Library is vividly imagined, blending ethereal and technological elements. Sensory details (spoon's warmth, lullaby echoes) enhance immersion. Atmosphere supports both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spoon, lullabies) and subtext (walls needing doors). The ending is emotionally resonant and thematically rich. Prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>
