<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus and Chen are vividly drawn, with clear motivations rooted in shared trauma. Marcus's gambler persona contrasts well with his calculated redemption, though his carefree facade could be slightly more developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blueprint heist and moral reckoning driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the final reveal of the altered blueprint could be subtly foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The workshop’s decaying tech and videotapes create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (ivory dice, copper entrails) immerse the reader, though a touch more olfactory/tactile imagery would heighten the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft: symbolism (dice, tapes), subtext (justice vs. chaos), and a resonant ending. The theme of redemption through sabotage is layered and impactful. Only minor polish needed in dialogue rhythm.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Fresh metaphors ("copper entrails," "magnetic memories") and nuanced emotion. The gambler’s dichotomy and workshop setting feel uniquely executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, powerful micro-narrative. Every element serves the story’s depth. Leaves the reader haunted by its moral ambiguity and technical ingenuity.</comment>
