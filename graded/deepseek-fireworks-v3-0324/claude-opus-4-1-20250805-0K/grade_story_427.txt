<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from past trauma to present revelation is tightly woven, with deconstruction as a driving force and the sock as a resonant symbol. Pacing is excellent despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse blends seamlessly with the story’s metaphysical tone, its isolation amplifying Cyrus’s obsession. Sensory details (clicking arm, dusty equations) deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense microcosm. Every element serves the narrative, leaving the reader haunted by the interplay of dreams and reality.</comment>
