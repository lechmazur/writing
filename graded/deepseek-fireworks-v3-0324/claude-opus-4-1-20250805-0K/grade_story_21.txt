<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen’s transformation from diplomat to vengeful predator is compelling and well-developed; her motivation is starkly clear, and her actions align with her grief-driven resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is taut and coherent, with a clear arc from setup to climax. The pacing is efficient, though the resolution’s swiftness slightly undercuts its emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The decaying city hall and drum circles create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (musty scent, bloodstained tassel) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with potent symbolism (fox tail as evidence/memorial) and subtext (revenge’s corrosive cost). The ending lingers with brutal clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The organically synthetic twist and Chen’s cold methodology feel fresh, though the bandit’s dialogue edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story’s emotional core, and the brevity amplifies its impact. Leaves the reader unsettled and reflective.</comment>
