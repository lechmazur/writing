<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brother Tidewhisper's complexity is vividly portrayed, blending zealotry with introspection. His playful yet lethal nature and internal conflict are compelling, though his 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently, with the reversed echoes cleverly linking past and present. Pacing is tight, but the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The coral reef city is lushly rendered, with sensory details (backward ripples, bleached spires) enhancing atmosphere. The plush-object connection is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (octopus, echoes) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, though the sermon's impact feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors (e.g., "waterlogged with doubt") stand out. Minor overuse of "calculatedly playful."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for interpretation.</comment>
