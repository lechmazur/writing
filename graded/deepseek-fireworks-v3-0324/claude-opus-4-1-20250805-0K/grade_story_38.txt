<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from vengeful poet to advocate of non-violence is compelling and well-realized, though his initial motivations could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and effective use of flashbacks. Pacing is strong, though the subway frame feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic and botanical samples create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, but the subway setting lacks the same richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (botanical samples as mentors) and subtext. The ending is resonant and thematically satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, though the "drunken confessions" element feels slightly contrived. Metaphors are fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative rather than constrain it. Leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
