<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina's reluctance and analytical playfulness are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and revelations. Her motivation is clear, though her transition to acceptance could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined, with the orchard and futuristic hub creating a striking contrast. Sensory details (e.g., binary whispers, dissolving tooth) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (orchard as repository, trees singing) and a layered theme (preservation vs. progress) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but could linger longer emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, subverting tropes (cursed orchard as archive). Language is fresh, avoiding clichés. Only minor nitpicks: "gleeful sorrow" risks overstatement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, serving the story’s depth. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting question about legacy and sacrifice.</comment>
