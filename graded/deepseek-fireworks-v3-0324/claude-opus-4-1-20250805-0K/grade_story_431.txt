<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's introversion and dancer background are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, though her "illogically logical" trait could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with dance-as-decoding driving the narrative forward logically and with satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasteland and office settings are vividly rendered, with sensory details (burnt sugar, hum of processors) enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (dance as cipher) and symbolism (astronomical charts as survival maps). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh imagery. Avoids clich√©s, though "affectionate detachment" could be more subtly woven in.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering sense of melancholy and hope.</comment>
