<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict and transformation are compelling, though his stoicism slightly overshadows nuanced vulnerability until the climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful structure with a resonant arc. The wallet's role as a catalyst feels organic, but the bee metaphor slightly overpowers plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—hives and radio static merge into a haunting, tactile world. The bar's silence and rooftop sanctuary are masterfully contrasted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Layered symbolism (bees/static, paper plane/grocery list) and subtext about vulnerability elevate this beyond its word limit. Only the ending's clarity falters slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("veil like static on old screens"). No clichés; emotions are shown via precise details (e.g., the bee on Marcus's collar).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about honesty's cost.</comment>
