<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and poetic, though her "aimlessly passionate" nature could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a satisfying arc. The leaf pattern as a targeting system is inventive, but the arrow's payoff feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and eerie; the subterranean colosseum and carnival debris are evocatively juxtaposed. Sensory details (e.g., bioluminescent walls) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (fork, arrow, paper airplane) and subtext. The ending’s thematic resonance ("compassion creates ripples") lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "moonlight like liquid silver"). Avoids clichés, though the "dangerous knowledge" trope leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, with creative interplay between setting, object, and theme.</comment>
