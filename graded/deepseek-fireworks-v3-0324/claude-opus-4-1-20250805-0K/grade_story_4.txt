<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thalia's motivation is clear and her connection to the pencil case and gods reveals depth. Her playful yet sacred role as a DJ-stylus hybrid is distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly from setup to resolution, with the flickering vision and unraveling thread driving the arc. Pacing is tight yet immersive.</comment>
