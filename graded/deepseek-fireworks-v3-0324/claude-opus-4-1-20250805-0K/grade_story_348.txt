<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's somnambulism and humility are well-integrated into her motivations, though her "perfect recall" could be explored more deeply to strengthen her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is cohesive and purposefully paced, with the annual pilgrimage and laboratory exploration forming a clear arc. Minor tightening of cause-and-effect moments could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (bioluminescent algae, moss-covered stairs) and the sunken lab’s eerie decay create a haunting, immersive world that drives the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: the bottled lightning bugs as neural lightning, transgenic trees as ancestral records, and the interplay of science/spirituality offer profound subtext and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids tropes and clichés, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "neural patterns" in bark) and nuanced emotion. The prose is vivid but never purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative where elements serve the story’s theme of inherited wisdom. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering mystique.</comment>
