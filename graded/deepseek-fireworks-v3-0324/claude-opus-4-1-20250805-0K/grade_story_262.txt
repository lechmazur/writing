<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisa's duality as an alien and teacher is compelling, but her inner conflict ("righteously flawed") could be more deeply explored to heighten emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-effect logic is tight, and the discovery arc feels earned, though the climax leans slightly on convenience (tile activating precisely now).</comment>
