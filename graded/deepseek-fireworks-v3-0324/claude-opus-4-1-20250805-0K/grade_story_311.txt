<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus and Lucia are richly developed, with clear, consistent motivations that drive the plot. Their interactions reveal depth and nuance, particularly Marcus's transformation from calcified protector to purposeful rebel.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could benefit from slightly more elaboration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, enhancing the story's mood and conflict. Sensory details (e.g., "eternally golden leaves") immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb storytelling with layered symbolism (trees as memory/freedom), evocative prose, and a satisfying, thematically rich ending. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The narrative voice is distinct, and emotional depth is shown rather than told. Fresh metaphors ("rage crystallized into lunar ice") stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
