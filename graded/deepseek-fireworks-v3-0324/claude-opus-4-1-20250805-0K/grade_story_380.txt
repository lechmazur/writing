<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's fragmented self and dream-thieving curse are compelling, but her motivation to coax thunder feels slightly underdeveloped. Her distinct voice and actions are well-aligned with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and effective pacing. The ending delivers a satisfying resolution, though the connection to the last human birth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details and a hauntingly effective setting. The treehouse library and oppressive humidity enhance the story's mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, imagery) and a deeply thematic exploration of identity. The writing style elevates the emotional impact, making the story linger in the mind.</comment>
