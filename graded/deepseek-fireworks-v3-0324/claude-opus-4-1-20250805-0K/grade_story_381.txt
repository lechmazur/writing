<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hushed necromancer’s motivation and personality are vividly rendered, with her mentor’s influence and her quiet determination shaping her actions and voice. The baseball cap and old movies enrich her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the necromancer’s mapping mission and spectral partnership driving the narrative. Pacing is efficient, and the ending hints at future progress without feeling incomplete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave and futuristic nostalgia create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crystals humming, holographic interface) deepen the world’s paradox of death and technology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered themes (legacy, collaboration between life/death). The dialogue feels organic, and the ghostly mentor’s return is poignant. Literary devices (symbolism, subtext) are deftly employed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original blend of necromancy, speleology, and retro cinema. The voice avoids clichés, and emotions are shown through subtle gestures (touching the cap) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering melancholy. The thematic depth—mapping as a metaphor for connection—elevates it.</comment>
