<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus' cynically hopeful demeanor is clear and consistent, with his motivation ("lure possibility from despair") driving his actions. His distinct voice and reactions to the herb bundle and speed dating event reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with the speed dating framing effectively driving the dissemination of knowledge. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc (displacement → purpose) feels complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the observatory and doomed orchard enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (herb scents, pre-dawn hush) amplify the "charred serenity" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of literary devices (e.g., "horizons of mercy" as metaphor). Ending is purposeful, and the theme—technology as both destruction and salvation—resonates deeply. Dialogue is natural and revealing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("stone skull" observatory) and nuanced emotion (Marcus' near-laugh at his irony). No AI "tells"—style is distinct and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements serve the story flawlessly. Length feels deliberate, with depth beyond the word count. Leaves reader with lingering questions about hope and consequence.</comment>
