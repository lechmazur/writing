<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's streetwise survival instincts and nuanced reaction to the brooch reveal depth. Her "confident uncertainty" is compelling, though her backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tight, dreamlike pacing with a clear arc. The brooch’s discovery and the temple’s temporal distortions drive the plot seamlessly. Minor risk of abstraction overwhelming coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The temple’s paradoxes (rotting/blooming fruit, reversed murals) are masterfully evoked. Sensory details (silver juice, cold brooch) heighten the uncanny atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the brooch as time’s web) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the monk’s dialogue edges toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original handling of time and perception. The "confident uncertainty" tone avoids cliché, but the orphan trope leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of assigned elements. The brooch’s duality and the temple’s timelessness elevate the story beyond its constraints.</comment>
