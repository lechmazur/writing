<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The soothsayer's trembling hands and sarcastic wit reveal a deeply human, flawed character. Her panic and determination are clear, though her backstory could be slightly more defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle box and water rings driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, though the final reveal (seeds) feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert and flickering billboards create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (warped wood, pulsing light) immerse the reader brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (rings as prophecies, billboards as lies). The ending subverts expectations with quiet impact. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("destiny rarely advertised its methods in neon") and biting sarcasm elevate this beyond clich√©. The environmental critique feels urgent, not preachy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question: Can small acts undo colossal harm?</comment>
