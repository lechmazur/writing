<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's spinelessness is well-conveyed through his wavering voice and reliance on lies. His followers' desperate hope contrasts effectively with his hollow leadership.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows naturally, with the rain and marigolds serving as subtle catalysts. The tight word limit is used efficiently to imply a larger world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city is vividly rendered, and the toxic sky creates a menacing contrast. Sensory details (salt crystals, rain rhythms) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (owl, tears) and layered themes of deception and dependency. The ending lingers with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("statically dynamic"). Avoids clich√©s, though the cult trope is slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for unresolved tension and reader reflection.</comment>
