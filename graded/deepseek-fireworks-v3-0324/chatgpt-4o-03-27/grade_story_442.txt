<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varn's "comfortingly pessimistic" attribute is well-integrated, but his backstory as a cartographer feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the windmill's final rotation could be more explicitly tied to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with exceptional sensory details (spores, pulsing walls) that elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (memory as distortion, void as internal/external) create lasting impact. Ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "vectorize" risks feeling gimmicky. Nuanced handling of emotion avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
