<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into his telepathic nature, revealing a poignant longing for truth. His "tragically joyful" state and reactions to the girl's recognition are beautifully nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the girl's arrival serving as a perfect catalyst for resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "throughout planning" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered, with sensory details (soot, acidic rain) enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness. The setting amplifies Elian's isolation and the girl's contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "gears turned like clockwork hearts") and symbolism (ink as prayer). The ending is resonant, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery. The "tragically joyful" tone avoids cliché, and the telepathic statue concept feels inventive rather than gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich vignette. The brevity serves the story’s intimacy, and the elements (e.g., calligraphy, hair tie) feel organic, not forced.</comment>
