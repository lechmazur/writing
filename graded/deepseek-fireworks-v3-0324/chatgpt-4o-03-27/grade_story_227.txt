<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's underdog status and dream-decoding obsession are vividly portrayed, but his "drainingly invigorated" state feels slightly overused without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with the frozen countdown and sun-tracking method elegantly driving the narrative. Pacing is tight, though the uprising's subtlety risks undercutting tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”rust, ozone, and fractured light create a hauntingly vivid setting. The spaceport's dereliction mirrors Elian's stalled ambition perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (burning tree, obsidian sliver) and a resonant theme of quiet rebellion elevate the prose. The ending's perceptual shift is masterful, though the uprising's vagueness slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "drainingly invigorated" and "rebellious placidity" verge on contrived. The microscope's dream-cartographer backstory is a standout flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story's mood and theme, though the uprising's execution feels slightly abstract for its weight.</comment>
