<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corlen's fidgety nature and musical failure contrast powerfully with his forge-born magic, creating a layered, compelling character. His motivation to "remake" is clear and deeply tied to his past shame.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the chalkboard notes and seed-core logically driving the action. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution slightly rushes the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (ozone, trembling petals) immerse the reader and amplify the theme of decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (keys, star) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the theme of "persistence over power" could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "forge-born magic"). No clich√©s; emotions are shown through action (shaking hands, whispered incantations).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful blend of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope. Only minor tightening of the climax would make it flawless.</comment>
