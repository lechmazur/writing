<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juno's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with her storm-chasing past and carousel restoration goal revealing a nuanced inner conflict. Her "eagerly unwilling" nature adds complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the tapestry's decoding logically leading to the hidden chamber. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tapestry as memory, tongs as resilience) and layered themes (restoration vs. escape) elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The carousel metaphor and "nostalgic innovation" tone feel uniquely crafted, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
