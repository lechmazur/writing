<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his "rarely authentic" attribute could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ink blotter and constellations driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (torchlight, cracked mosaics) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink blotter as key, broken constellations) elevates the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with strong subtext about self-liberation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "daring caution" tone occasionally wavers. Avoids clich√©s, and the emotional nuance feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story feels complete despite its brevity. Leaves a lingering impact about self-deception and redemption.</comment>
