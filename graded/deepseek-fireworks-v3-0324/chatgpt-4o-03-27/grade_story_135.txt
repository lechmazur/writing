<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elka's ambition and loyalty are vividly portrayed, driving her actions consistently. Her motivation to preserve dialects is clear and deeply personal, reinforced by the straw's significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bruised poster and caravan tracks logically leading to the phonograph. Pacing is excellent, balancing discovery with emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (bruises as clues, fermentation as memory) and a resonant theme of cultural preservation elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically cohesive.</comment>
