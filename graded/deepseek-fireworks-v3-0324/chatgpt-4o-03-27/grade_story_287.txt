<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his traits, but his "torn visionary" aspect could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and richly detailed, with the library's decay mirroring Elian's quest. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue (phone call) could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though the "cellphone from 1920" risks gimmickiness without deeper grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>
