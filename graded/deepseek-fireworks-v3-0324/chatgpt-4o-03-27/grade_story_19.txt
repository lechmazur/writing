<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The feral ranger's wild, instinct-driven nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to learn from the child rather than protect them is refreshingly original. Her reactions to the code and the scale reveal depth and consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the ranger's arrival, the code's revelation, and the child's significance all connecting seamlessly. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dandelion field and dawn setting are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (trembling seeds, exhaling earth) enhancing the atmosphere. The tone of hopeful melancholy permeates every detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scale, seeds), layered subtext (generational echoes, unfiltered truth), and a hauntingly evocative ending elevate this beyond mere plot. The prose is lyrical yet precise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with no clich√©s or formulaic phrasing. The ranger's "precisely random" gait and the code-word method feel fresh. Emotional resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with a lingering sense of wonder and change.</comment>
