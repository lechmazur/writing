<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thespianus Vale's dramatic flair and clear motivation to outplay The Director are compelling, though his "oddly seldom" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with riddles driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent, though the word limit slightly truncates resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city and frenzied sales create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (creaking shells, fluttering cape) enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cracked case as a relic) and thematic depth (kindness vs. omnipotence) elevate the story. The ending is poignant and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "frenzied tranquility" slightly strains tone consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels deliberate and layered. Leaves a lingering question about defiance and performance.</comment>
