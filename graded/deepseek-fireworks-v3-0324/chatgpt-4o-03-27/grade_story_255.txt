<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "nondescript" nature slightly limits depth. Her actions align well with her analytical innovation and quest for justice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the relic's discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (petrichor, dust) enhancing mood. The tower and rain are meaningfully connected to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (compass, rain) and subtext. Ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (scent-based algorithms). Avoids clich√©s, but the "mythic relic" trope is slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated. The story feels deliberate and lingers, though the relic's power could be more uniquely defined.</comment>
