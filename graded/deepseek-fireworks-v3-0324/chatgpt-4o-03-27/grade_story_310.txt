<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, with his methodical chaos revealing depth. His "wide-eyed" nature contrasts intriguingly with his calculated defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Elian's resistance driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater city is vividly rendered, with sensory details (coral whispers, jellyfish lanterns) enhancing atmosphere. Setting and tone merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: symbolism (hammer, silence), layered themes (obedience vs. wisdom), and a resonant ending. Prose is lyrical yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "blade wrapped in velvet") feel fresh. Emotional resonance is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. A standout piece.</comment>
