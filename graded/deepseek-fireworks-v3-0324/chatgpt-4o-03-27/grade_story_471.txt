<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jace's reckless yet introspective nature is well-developed, and his motivation to map ghost towns is clear and compelling. His "meticulously careless" method adds depth, though his sudden recollection of his sister feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lens and musicians guiding Jace to his past. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the transition to the sister's reveal could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair and misty forest create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (groaning Ferris wheel, glowing footprints) are evocative and enhance the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and symbolism (lens as a tool for memory). The theme of confronting the past is poignant, though the musicians' role could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The vintage lens and "atomized" mist are inventive, though the sister's reappearance edges toward familiar tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
