<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions and use of the rosebud revealing depth. His "uncertainly certain" nature adds nuance, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the echo test and rosebud serving as logical keys to progression. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The castle ruin library is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, cold air, rusted pipes) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirrors, rosebud) and layered themes (empathy vs. control) elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The rosebud's transformation and the echo test are inventive. Minor overuse of "hush" slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
