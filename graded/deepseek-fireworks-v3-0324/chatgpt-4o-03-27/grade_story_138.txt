<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lord Thalen's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past nobility, with his actions (reassembling ticket stubs) revealing his defiance against erasure. His voice is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could deepen his nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the drone's intrusion and Thalen's defiance creating a clear arc. Pacing is strong, though the lab's combustion threat feels underutilized as a climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's ozone-and-burnt-paper atmosphere is vividly rendered, enhancing Thalen's isolation. The drone's hum and the stubs' tactile details immerse the reader, though the lab's "spontaneous combustion" aspect could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stubs as fragmented memory) and subtext (nobility in remembrance). The ending is poignant, and the theme of resisting erasure resonates powerfully. Only minor tightening of the drone's role could elevate further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("wall stood—fragile, absurd, and unyielding"). Avoids clichés and AI pitfalls, though the lab setting slightly strains plausibility for the character's history.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's emotional core. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about memory's power. A touch more clarity on the lab's purpose would perfect it.</comment>
