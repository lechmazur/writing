<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juno's motivation is clear and consistent, with her meekly assertive nature and oath-breaking adding depth. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "forthright peddler" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from beginning to end. The pacing is effective, and the cause-and-effect relationships are logical. The word limit is well-managed, though the sister's reveal could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (antiseptic, burnt ozone) enhancing the atmosphere. The tone complements the concept of redemption, and the setting meaningfully connects to the bouquet and oath.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, using symbolism (the bouquet, the oath) and subtext effectively. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme of redemption is explored with depth and nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "the universe hummed its secret song"). Emotion is shown rather than told, and the writing style is purposeful and distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines its elements. The brief length feels deliberate, and the narrative leaves a lingering emotional resonance. The elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
