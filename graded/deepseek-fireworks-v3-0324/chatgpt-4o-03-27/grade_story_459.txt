<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliot's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his ghost-seeing ability, revealing a nuanced emotional arc. His actions align with his desire for liberation, and his "elegantly clumsy" attribute adds charm without undermining his depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ghostly encounter serving as a natural climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned, though the sand cathedral's collapse could be more explicitly tied to Eliot's emotional shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's surreal atmosphere is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's themes of transience and memory. Sensory details (salt-stained glass, humming dehumidifiers) immerse the reader without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flower crown, sand) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with Eliot's humming subtly underscoring his transformation. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The ghost-seeing mechanic feels fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Emotion is shown through action (e.g., trembling fingers) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. The interplay of ghosts, silence, and liberation lingers after reading.</comment>
