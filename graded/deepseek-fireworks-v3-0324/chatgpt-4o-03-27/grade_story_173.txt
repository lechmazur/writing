<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calen's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions reveal depth, and his 'voice' is distinct through his quiet gravity and interaction with the spectral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent, balancing urgency and reflection within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly rendered, with sensory details (silt, barnacles, sea pressure) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the story's melancholic, exploratory tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (leaves as maps, phantom guidance) and subtext (civilization's fragility). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of reclamation resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors (leaves as "kitchen table wisdom") are fresh, and the emotional nuance is shown, not told. No AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth and evocative imagery.</comment>
