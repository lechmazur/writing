<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "uncertain" nature could be more deeply explored. His actions align well with his desire to map the trails, but his internal conflict about immortality could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from the verdict to Elian's resolution. The pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect logic is sound, though the judge's verdict feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (e.g., the scale's shimmer, the creaking stalls) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (the scale as a broken promise) and subtext (immortality's loneliness). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "a mundane miracle stitched into the sky"). Emotion is shown subtly, and the style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
