<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the concert as a clever vehicle for the signal. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bathhouse-turned-concert-hall is evocative and thematically resonant. Sensory details (marble, organ tones) immerse the reader while reinforcing the story's core ideas.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (music as memory, fear vs. truth), a haunting ending, and prose that balances lyricism with precision. The theme lingers powerfully.</comment>
