<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past actions, with a distinct arc of redemption. His "voice" is consistent and nuanced, though his transformation could be slightly more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear cause-and-effect chain, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, but the climax could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city and its atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (copper dust, mask lenses) enhancing immersion. The setting and timeframe merge seamlessly with the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (mask as conscience) and subtext (redemption through engineering). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with minimal exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The nano-city and wish-weave concepts are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown rather than stated. Language is precise without being ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative fusion of sci-fi and emotional depth elevates it.</comment>
