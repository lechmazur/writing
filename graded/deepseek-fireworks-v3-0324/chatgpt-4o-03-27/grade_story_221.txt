<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions and reactions revealing a nuanced, grief-shaped personality. His "voice" is distinct, though some emotional beats could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost's appearance could be more gradually foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details that amplify the melancholic tone. The atmosphere perfectly supports Cassian's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (amber, shadows) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue could feel less expository.</comment>
