<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his past as a dream thief, revealing a haunting, fragmented psyche. His actions and reactions are consistent with his tragic backstory and desperate longing for redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from isolation to catharsis. The photo album's plunge and the sky's response create a resonant cause-and-effect chain, though the dream war backstory feels slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The petrified oak and desolate desert amplify the story's melancholy. Sensory details (groaning treehouse, warped album) immerse the reader, and the sky's silence-turned-weeping is masterfully atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (rain as emotional release) and subtext (stolen dreams as lost identity). The ending is both surprising and inevitable, with layered themes of memory and atonement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors ("bottling dreams like fireflies"). The quiet mania feels authentic, and the prose avoids clich√© while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the narrative cohesively. The brevity enhances the story's haunting quality, leaving a lingering question: Can stolen fragments ever be reclaimed?</comment>
