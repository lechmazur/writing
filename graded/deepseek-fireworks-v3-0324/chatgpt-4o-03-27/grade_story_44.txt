<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's backstory and motivation are vividly drawn, with clear emotional resonance. Her transition from stablehand to scavenger feels organic, and her reverence for craftsmanship is compelling. However, her "feisty" nature could be more consistently demonstrated in her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to creation. The connection between the oil lamp and the carousel horse is elegant, and pacing is well-managed. The word limit is used effectively, though the resolution could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with sensory details (ozone, rust) and a richly imagined setting. The space debris art studio is both unique and thematically resonant. The atmosphere enhances Mira's mission and the story's tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The storytelling is layered and evocative, with strong symbolism (the lamp-horse as rebirth). Literary devices are used deftly, and the ending is satisfying. The theme of redemption through small acts is poignant and well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (stars like "old neon signs"). Emotion is shown subtly, and the prose is purposeful. No AI-generated tropes or inconsistencies disrupt the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brief length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. A standout piece with depth and polish.</comment>
