<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each round of the game serving as a metaphor for Elias's internal battle. The pacing is excellent, and the ending feels earned, though the party invitation slightly disrupts the focus.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is richly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and tone align perfectly with Elias's isolation and the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the black rose, the game) to deepen its themes. The ending is poignant and resonant, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
