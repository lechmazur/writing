<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calder's brashness and wild spirit are vividly portrayed, aligning well with his motivation to preserve games. His distinct voice and actions reveal depth, though his transition from smith to guardian could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the medal's pulse driving tension. The climax resolves coherently, though the figure's introduction feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The discount store setting is richly atmospheric, with dust and light enhancing the sacred tone. Sensory details (clanging register, swirling motes) immerse the reader and support the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (dust as constellations) and symbolism (medal as key to memory) elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally, and the conflict is resolved with satisfying thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The nautilus spiral motif is inventive, though Calder's defiance could use more human inconsistency. Style is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements blend seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering warmth. Creative use of assigned elements (e.g., detonation as preservation) stands out.</comment>
