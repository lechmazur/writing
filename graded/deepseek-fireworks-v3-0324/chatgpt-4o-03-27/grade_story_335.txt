<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rell's motivation is deeply rooted in personal history, and his actions align with his carefully reckless nature. His trembling hands and quest for the amber spider reveal a nuanced, haunted character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Rell's search to his emotional resolution. The pacing is deliberate, and the cause-and-effect chain (rumors → amber → reckoning) is logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral is vividly rendered, its decay and repurposing mirroring Rell's internal state. Sensory details (glowing hollow, spray-painted saints) deepen the atmosphere of longing and ruin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as trapped time, cathedral as memory) elevates the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with Rell's silent reckoning speaking louder than dialogue could.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The spider as a talisman and the cathedral's transformation feel inventive. Emotion is shown through action and subtext, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. The theme of forgiveness through remembrance is powerfully conveyed.</comment>
