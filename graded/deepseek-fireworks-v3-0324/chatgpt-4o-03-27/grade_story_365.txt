<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's deflated state and her motivation to rewrite history are compelling, but her "independently dependent" attribute could be more deeply explored to enhance her complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the ceremonial rope and perfume bottle serving as elegant mechanisms for time manipulation. Pacing is strong, though the dreamlike invitations could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival and subconscious realm merge beautifully, with sensory details (spun sugar, rusted canopy) amplifying the melancholic glee. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (perfume bottle as vanished possibilities) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lush but purposeful, with fresh metaphors ("voice cracked like old vinyl"). Minor risk of over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
