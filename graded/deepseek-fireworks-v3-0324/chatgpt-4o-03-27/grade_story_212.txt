<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His "typically atypical" nature and longing to escape are well-integrated, though his relationship with the cards could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent, and the ending feels earned, though the transition to the door of salt is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war silence create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (humming cork, shimmering light) are evocative and immersive, elevating the world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seeds as memory, cards as fate) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "song of boundaries" could be more tangible.</comment>
