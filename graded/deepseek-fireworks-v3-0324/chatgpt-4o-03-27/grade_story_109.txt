<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cael's transformation from cold detachment to artistic awakening is compelling and well-motivated, though his "lawfully rebellious" attribute could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit, but the transition from knight to artist feels slightly rushed. Pacing is otherwise strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric blend of espionage and folklore is masterfully rendered, with evocative sensory details (e.g., the flickering streetlamp, humming walls).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (mitten, altars) and subtext. The ending resonates, though Agent Mirelle's dialogue could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion elevate the story above clich√©. The "frostbitten detachment" motif is particularly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich vignette that lingers. The brevity feels deliberate, though the agent center's role could be deeper.</comment>
