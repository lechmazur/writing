<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's sleep-deprived state and inventor background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "fracture the prison walls of shame" feels slightly abrupt, needing more grounding earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the DNA-to-sound method driving the climax effectively. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the radio broadcast framing could be more seamlessly woven in.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk underworld are vividly rendered, with electric fruit and neural roots creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., bell's fractal glyphs) elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bell as key, orchard as confessional space) and emotional resonance stand out. The ending is satisfying, though the "shame" theme could be more subtly foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The DNA-as-sound concept is inventive, though the "singularly plural" phrasing feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its word limit. The elements serve the story’s emotional core, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
