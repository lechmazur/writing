<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jasper's motivation is clear and consistent, with his interrogation of ghosts revealing his complex relationship with remorse. His 'voice' is distinct, though his 'unusually normal' attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Jasper's interrogation driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful, though the 'story time' timeframe is slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the mood. The gas-masked scarecrows and humming cows create a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (the tape dispenser) and subtext. The ending lingers, and the dialogue is sharp. Emotional resonance is strong, though Jasper's 'mild fervor' could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, and the tone is consistent. Only minor quibble: the 'lull of remorse' concept could be more explicitly woven in.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story leaves a haunting aftertaste. A standout piece.</comment>
