<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elric's stoicism and quiet rebellion are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in personal loss and disillusionment. His habitual gestures (touching the cameo) subtly reinforce his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with encrypted labels and subversive miniatures driving the narrative. The word limit is used efficiently, though the brother's backstory feels slightly compressed.</comment>
