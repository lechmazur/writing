<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bard's shifting name and melancholic demeanor create a vivid, tragic figure. His motivation—escaping death—is clear, but his hesitation at the end adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the picnic tradition and tectonic setting driving the narrative. Pacing is strong, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tectonic edge and celestial hourglass create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (groaning earth, pulsing doorplate) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doorplate as relic, broken lute) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the "laughter echoing like thunder" slightly overreaches.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("joy so sharp it bled"). Avoids clichés, though "melancholic glee" toes the line of contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting tale. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache of loss and defiance.</comment>
