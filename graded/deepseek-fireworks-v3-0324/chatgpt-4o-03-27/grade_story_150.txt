<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calder's outlaw cowboy poet persona is distinct and his motivation to chase "intertwined destinies" is clear, though Elira's introduction feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the café's shifting walls and dice rolls driving the narrative logically toward the eclipse climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory and café are vividly rendered, with sensory details (cardamom steam, glowing runes) enhancing the atmosphere. The dome feels alive, adding depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dice, walls, constellations) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, leaving room for interpretation. Dialogue and style are polished.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of cowboy poet and steampunk is fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "voice like a cello string") are striking. No AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers after reading.</comment>
