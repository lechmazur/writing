<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jalen's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his sister's disappearance, but his "softly militant" resolve could be more explicitly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spyglass serving as a compelling catalyst. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from scavenger to hero could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (brittle leaves, tarnished brass) enhancing the atmosphere. The rooftop farm as an observatory is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "awe as resistance" could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The spyglass's cosmic vision is fresh, though the "late-blooming hero" trope leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. Leaves a lingering question about rebuilding through understanding.</comment>
