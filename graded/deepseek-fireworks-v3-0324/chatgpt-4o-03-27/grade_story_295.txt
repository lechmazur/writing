<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation is clear and consistent, with his jovial yet reluctant nature shining through. His transformation feels earned, though his "sellsword" background could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the time capsule tradition and transformation arc resolving cohesively. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the witch's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The herb garden and starlit atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (fragrant mist, shimmering ground) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (telescope as legacy, ivy-crest as growth) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the witch's "elegant mayhem" could be more fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("brewed chaos like tea"). Minor quibble: "boldly reluctant" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question: What truths will Corwin seek next?</comment>
