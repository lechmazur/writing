<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cale's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his family's history, but his "cheerless duelist" persona feels slightly underutilized in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from regret to redemption, though the spaceport setting's relevance to the recipe quest could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, blending sci-fi and gothic tones seamlessly, but the server room hum feels more decorative than essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolism, with a hauntingly memorable ending. The theme of forgiveness is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Only minor quibbles: "elasticize" borders on overused, and the duelist archetype is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply affecting story where elements serve the narrative rather than constrain it. Leaves a lasting emotional impression.</comment>
