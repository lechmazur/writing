<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's subdued vigilante nature and motivation to understand rather than punish are clear and consistent. His clumsy yet deliberate movements and the wooden bead's symbolism deepen his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mirror's distortions driving the narrative. The connection between beginning and end is strong, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like rust, mildew, and the mirror's pulse immerse the reader and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, using symbolism (the bead, the mirror) and subtext (redemption, brotherhood). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of war's cost and the mirror's role feel fresh. Nuanced emotions and vivid details elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering thought about war and reconciliation.</comment>
