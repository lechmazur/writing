<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rell's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the narrative with a distinct, melancholic voice. His actions align with his obsession, though some nuances of his past could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from obsession to resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the microfilm decoding feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (creaking observatory, pulsing sea glass) enhancing the gritty whimsy. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (sea glass as lens, void as grief) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with a style that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh (e.g., "black hole of doubt"), and emotional nuance is shown rather than stated. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
