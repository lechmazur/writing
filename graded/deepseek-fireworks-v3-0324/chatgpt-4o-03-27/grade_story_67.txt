<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jorren's joviality contrasts poignantly with his grief, revealing depth. His motivation to "tame darkness" is clear but could be more explicitly tied to his brother's legacy earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the metronome's rhythm driving the action. The arc from grief to creation feels complete, though the train's symbolism could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic's atmosphere is masterfully evoked—rust, dust, and gears amplify the theme of decay and renewal. Sensory details (humming earring, heat) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sculpture as "half angel, half shadow") and subtext elevate the story. The ending’s quiet defiance lingers, though the "fervent indifference" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (gears as "ornaments"). Minor quibble: "fervor" and "fervent indifference" clash tonally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader pondering endurance as both burden and art.</comment>
