<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and compelling, with his trickster past and exile adding depth. His actions align with his preservationist role, though his "impatiently patient" nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the dare driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the rivals' involvement feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The biodome setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (flickering sun, irrigation hum) enhancing the mood. The ghostly tone complements the theme of preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose and layered symbolism (e.g., fading gift tags as breadcrumbs) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, with Jax's quiet resolve lingering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The premise of AI-augmented livestock speaking dying languages is fresh, and the prose avoids AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on language and exile.</comment>
