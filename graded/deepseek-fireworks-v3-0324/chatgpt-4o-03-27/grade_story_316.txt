<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's timid yet determined nature is well-developed, and her motivation to fulfill a childhood promise is clear and compelling. Her actions align with her traits, though her 'seraphic' aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from promise to resolution. The scoreboard mechanism is inventive, and pacing is excellent for the word limit. Minor quibble: the hidden alcove reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined temple setting is vividly atmospheric, blending industrial and sacred elements seamlessly. Sensory details (ozone, rusted pinball machines) deepen immersion. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon, scoreboard) and subtext (healing through shared labor). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Writing style elevates the narrative without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of mythic and industrial tropes. Emotional nuance avoids clich√©, and metaphors (e.g., "echo curled like a sigh") feel fresh. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Demonstrates mastery of constrained storytelling.</comment>
