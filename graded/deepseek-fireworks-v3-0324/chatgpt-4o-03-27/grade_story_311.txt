<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhea's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past, with her transformation from bodyguard to protector of truth feeling organic. Her "serendipitously stubborn" nature is subtly woven into her actions, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Rhea's trapped past to her hopeful future. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from Earth to moon could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust-etched glass, recycled air) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting mirrors Rhea's growth perfectly, though the "park visits" timeframe feels slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (photograph as past nourishment, vines as resistance) and a resonant theme of rebirth elevate the story. The ending is poignant and purposeful, though the "serene anger" tone could be more consistently embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The lunar resistance angle feels fresh, and Rhea's quiet defiance is compelling. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("serendipitously stubborn") slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply affecting story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. Only the "park visits" inclusion feels slightly forced.</comment>
