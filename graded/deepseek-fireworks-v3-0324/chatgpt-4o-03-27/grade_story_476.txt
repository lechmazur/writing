<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juno's "gentle brawler" duality is compelling, but his motivation to chronicle social changes feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his traits, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with the flat tire as a deliberate method. Pacing is tight, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—dust, silence, and spice smoke create a haunting, immersive world. The radio station setting elevates the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext and literary devices (e.g., "echo chamber" as metaphor). Ending is purposeful, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés, but some phrases ("landmines of memory") verge on overworked. Nuanced emotion shines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant, lingering question about forgotten voices.</comment>
