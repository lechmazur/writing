<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his grandfather's legacy, but his "mild zealot" trait could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the machine's revelation serving as a powerful climax. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the final realization feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending decay and wonder. Sensory details (dust, humming machines) enhance immersion, though more tactile descriptions could deepen the setting further.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bills as scars/stars) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though the machine's mechanics could be more vividly shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on legacy.</comment>
