<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's "shyly unstoppable" nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to find beauty in unexpected places is clear and consistent. His use of the brass magnifier and interaction with the censored book reveal depth, though his "sleepy stablehand" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the censored book and magnifier driving the surreal transformation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending resolves the arc while leaving room for mystery. Minor quibble: the film club's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (creaking wood, golden halos) amplifying the eerie, dreamlike atmosphere. The setting feels inseparable from the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stained-glass ruins, carousel lights) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The theme of forgotten beauty resonates deeply, though the "fierce repose" tone occasionally wavers into vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The magnifier and censored book are fresh devices, though the "dreams in the ruins" concept edges toward familiarity. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that wears its constraints lightly. The elements serve the story organically, and the ending lingers. Only the "film club" detail feels slightly tacked-on.</comment>
