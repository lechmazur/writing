<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Svala's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and consistent, but her "rogue" nature could be more sharply defined. Her reactions to the merchant reveal depth, though her distinct voice could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the merchant's arrival and their shared ritual driving the story forward. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful, though the resolution could be slightly more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse and "overlooked era" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (amber ink, wine, aurora) enhance mood and setting beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative use of symbolism (inkwell, zigzag script) and subtext (unspoken offers). The ending lingers, and the theme of unvoiced emotions is powerfully conveyed through showing rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "fierce repose" feels slightly forced. The style is distinctive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Leaves a haunting impression of unspoken connections.</comment>
