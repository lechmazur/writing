<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the method (jigsaw edges) and action (defragmenting) driving the narrative logically. The arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is immersive and thematically resonant, enhancing the story's tone. Sensory details like "sterile glow" and "regolith dust" ground the cosmic scale.</comment>
