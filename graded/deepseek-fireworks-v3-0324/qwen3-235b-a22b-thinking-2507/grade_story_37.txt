<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from con artist to guardian is compelling and well-developed. His motivation shifts believably, and his "dishonestly honest" nature adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from detour to redemption. The yodel as a turning point is unexpected but coherent, resolving the central conflict effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The waiting room frame adds contrast but doesn't disrupt immersion.</comment>
