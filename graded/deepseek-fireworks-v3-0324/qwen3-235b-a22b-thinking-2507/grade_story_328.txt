<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively from isolation to hope, with the gold thread serving as a clever, organic guide. Pacing is tight yet deliberate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mirage oasis and abandoned server farms merge dystopia and mysticism brilliantly. Sensory details (dust, frayed tapestry) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (gold threads, blank card) and subtext (technology vs. connection) are masterfully layered. The ending lingers with quiet triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving a stark, hopeful afterimage.</comment>
