<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s internal conflict and growth are vividly portrayed, with his journey from self-doubt to self-acceptance feeling organic and deeply human. His distinct voice and emotional vulnerability stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the phone and nest serving as strong symbolic anchors. Pacing is excellent; the resolution feels earned, though the nebula transition is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is a breathtaking, immersive setting. Sensory details (bioluminescent trees, cosmic static) deepen the atmosphere. The mycelium network and static-laden phone are brilliantly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (twigs as resilience, phone as connection to wisdom) elevates the story. The ending resonates deeply, and the theme of self-acceptance is powerfully "shown" through Kael’s actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("roots you accept," "cracks where light enters") avoid cliché. Emotional resonance is subtle yet profound. The voice feels uniquely literary, not AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A masterful balance of assigned elements. The brevity enhances impact, leaving a haunting aftertaste. The story transcends its constraints to feel expansive.</comment>
