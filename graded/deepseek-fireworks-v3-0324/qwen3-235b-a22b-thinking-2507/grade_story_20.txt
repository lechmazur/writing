<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation and backstory are vividly clear, but his 'disappointed archer' trait feels slightly underdeveloped in active choices beyond regret.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight, with a clear arc from hesitation to resolve. The inverted waterfall's symbolism ties the ending beautifully, though the bridge metaphor is somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial bodies create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (tarnished comb, stone bridge) amplify regret elegantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft with layered metaphors (comb as anchor, waterfall as life reversal). Ending resonates with thematic weight, though the 'passionate disinterest' phrasing slightly overexplains.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés, but 'anxiously calm' paradox could be more subtly shown. Comb’s symbolism feels fresh, not AI-generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere powerfully, but the bridge metaphor borders on over-literal. Length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
