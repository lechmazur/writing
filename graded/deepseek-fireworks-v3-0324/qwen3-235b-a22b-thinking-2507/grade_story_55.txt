<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas' motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his identity as a bard and lover of lost arts. His grief for Elara and dedication to preserving craftsmanship are compelling, though his internal conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Silas' reflection to his act of defiance. The tight word limit is used effectively, though the transition to the alcove feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The utopia design studio is vividly rendered, with sharp contrasts between sterile perfection and Silas' tactile, imperfect world. The bell's echo is a standout sensory detail that deepens the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (keys, bell, Lyra’s Dawn) and subtext ("preserve the soul, not just the song"). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "raucously silent" refrain borders on overuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a distinct voice. The emotional depth avoids cliché, though the "doomed bard" trope is lightly relied upon. No AI-generated stiffness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where assigned elements serve the narrative organically. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
