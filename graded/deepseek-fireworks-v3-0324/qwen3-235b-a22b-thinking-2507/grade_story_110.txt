<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the water clock and eulogies serving as effective metaphors. Pacing is deliberate yet never sluggish, and the ending resonates with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolic, with the moss-covered lantern and repair shop enhancing the atmosphere of decay and hidden truths. Sensory details (oil, rain) deepen the mood.</comment>
