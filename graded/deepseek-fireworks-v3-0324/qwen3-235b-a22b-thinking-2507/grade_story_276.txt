<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's unease as an emissary is clear and drives his actions, though his inner conflict could be more deeply explored. His motivation is consistent and revealed through his interactions with the debris and postcards.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the lurch in the tracking feed serving as a pivotal moment that resolves Kael's unease. The story achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with logical cause-and-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rustling postcards, cold fridge) enhancing atmosphere. The setting meaningfully supports the theme of redemption through decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (debris as language, postcards as messages) and subtext (redemption in neglect). The ending is satisfying and prompts reflection. Strong showing over telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors (cosmic grammar, debris as syllables). Avoids clich√©s and formulaic phrasing. Emotional resonance is achieved through nuanced storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dominating it. The brevity is deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
