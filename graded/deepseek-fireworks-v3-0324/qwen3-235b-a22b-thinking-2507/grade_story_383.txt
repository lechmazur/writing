<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>General Aris's exhaustion and fear are vividly portrayed, with his brittle spirit and trembling hands revealing depth. His motivation—dethroning fear—is clear and consistent, and the waitress's mischievous wisdom contrasts effectively with his weariness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's progression is tight and purposeful, moving from despair to renewal. The connection between beginning (defeat) and end (resolve) is strong. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, with no rushed or dragging moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner is evoked with sharp sensory details (stale air, dried seaweed), enhancing the atmosphere. The setting reinforces the theme of cosmic absurdity and human perseverance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seaweed, photo arcs) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme—fear as a dance, not a conquerable force—is profound and well-executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "mischievous wisdom" tone and cosmic metaphor feel uniquely crafted. Emotion is shown subtly (e.g., the general's rusty chuckle).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
