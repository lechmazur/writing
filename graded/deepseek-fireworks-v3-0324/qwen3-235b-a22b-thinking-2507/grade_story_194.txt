<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's transition from lumberjack to healer is compelling, with clear motivation and distinct voice, though his "gracefully awkward" trait could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with strong cause-and-effect, but the coded letter's revelation feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ossuary restaurant and city atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing themes of life/death. Sensory details (bones, broth, bike rides) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bones, salve) and subtext (healing as resistance). Ending is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on tropes (healer vs. war). Nuanced emotions, though a few phrases feel overly poetic. Style avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively; brief length feels deliberate. Lingering thematic resonance (healing vs. violence) elevates the story.</comment>
