<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and internal conflict are vividly portrayed, with subtle shifts in his demeanor revealing deep-rooted shame. His motivation and reactions align well, though his transition to humility could benefit from slightly more nuanced buildup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the song and manacles serving as potent symbols. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, but the climax (manacles shattering) leans slightly on convention.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard’s sensory details (plum blossoms, inkstone) and the "harsh tenderness" tone create a striking atmosphere. The setting actively reinforces the swordsman’s emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spark, manacles) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the master’s wisdom borders on cliché. Dialogue is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., manacles as "dead insects") and fresh handling of tropes (disgraced warrior) stand out. Minor over-reliance on "light/dark" imagery slightly dulls the impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally charged narrative. The elements serve the story seamlessly, and the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
