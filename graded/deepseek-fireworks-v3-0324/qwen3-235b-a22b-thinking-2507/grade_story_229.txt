<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her personality, though her "mildly curious" nature feels slightly underdeveloped compared to her profound emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arcs elegantly within the tight word limit, with the rain and box serving as strong connective tissue between past and present. Minor pacing hiccups near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—every sensory detail (barnacles, rain, hum of the box) deepens the graveyard's melancholic resonance and Elara's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (memory as resonance) and subtext. The ending’s acceptance of absurdity lingers brilliantly, though the transition to it could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, original prose with minimal cliché. The "cosmic intimacy" tone occasionally risks overwrought phrasing but mostly succeeds.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, amplifying the story’s emotional impact.</comment>
