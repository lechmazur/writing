<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her actions; her remorse and hope drive the narrative. Kael’s complexity adds tension, though his sudden shift could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a strong cause-effect chain. The tight word limit slightly rushes Kael’s concession, but the arc resolves satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The nano-city’s bioluminescent decay and fractured aqueducts are vividly rendered, enhancing the themes of regret and renewal. Sensory details (crystalline residue, humming soldering iron) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mask as judgment/conduit), layered subtext (forgiveness≠erasure), and evocative prose elevate this. The ending’s quiet hope lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (wishes as "fireflies in remorse-forgiveness limbo") avoid cliché. Minor overuse of "suspiciously straightforward" slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with creative fusion of sci-fi and emotional depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant thematic echoes.</comment>
