<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's soft-voiced nature and Kael's quiet partnership are distinct and consistent, revealing depth through their actions and the mission's stakes. Their motivation is clear but slightly underdeveloped in the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plotâ€™s urgency and structure are tightly woven, with the blackout and silent plains driving a coherent, impactful arc. Pacing is excellent, though the train shift feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating cloud cafe and silent plains are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (ozone, silver grass) heightening the ethereal yet urgent atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (silence as theft, preservation as agony), vivid metaphors (embroidered vest as map), and a resonant ending elevate this beyond the literal. Minor deduct for over-reliance on "blissful agony."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "constantly rare" and "blissful agony" verge on repetitive. The silent scream concept is fresh, but some phrasing leans slightly into AI-esque ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the vest and plains central to theme and tension. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
