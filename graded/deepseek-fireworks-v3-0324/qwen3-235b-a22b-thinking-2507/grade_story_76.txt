<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with the "warp" action driving the narrative elegantly. Pacing is excellent, and the story achieves a satisfying arc despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and haunting, with sensory details that amplify the mood. The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay perfectly complement the story's dreamlike core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and evocative prose elevate the storytelling. The ending lingers, and the theme of finding beauty in decay is powerfully conveyed. Minor dialogue absence is inconsequential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with creative and deliberate use of constraints. Leaves the reader with a resonant, layered impression.</comment>
