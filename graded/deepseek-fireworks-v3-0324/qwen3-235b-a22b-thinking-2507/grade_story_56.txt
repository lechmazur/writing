<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and his actions align well with his bluffing swindler persona. His confession reveals depth, though his "invisible allies" could be more integrated into his decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dropped ledger and computer restart creating a natural progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the meet-cute feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a skyscraper is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (soil, overripe fruit) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and symbolism (e.g., the blank price tag). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of guilt and redemption is subtly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The writing style is distinctive, though "energetically lethargic" slightly strains authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering emotional weight is impressive.</comment>
