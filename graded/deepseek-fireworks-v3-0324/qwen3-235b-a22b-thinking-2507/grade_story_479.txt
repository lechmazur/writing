<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with clear alignment between her actions and her family legacy. Her "fruitlessly patient" attribute and glamorous undertaker role create a distinct, compelling character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Celeste's task to its symbolic resolution. However, the tight word limit slightly rushes the emotional payoff of elongating the archive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric blend of the digital archive and ancestral traditions is masterfully rendered, with rich sensory details (brass tape, paint fumes) enhancing the mood. The setting deeply supports the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the story evokes strong emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and a unique perspective. The prose avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering reflection on memory and legacy.</comment>
