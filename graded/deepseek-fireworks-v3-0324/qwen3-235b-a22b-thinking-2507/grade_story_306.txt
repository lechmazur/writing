<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's background as a former child star and his "authentically odd" nature are vividly portrayed, driving his actions and motivations with clarity and depth, though his "irreverent awe" could be more consistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's structure is cohesive and driven by the map's decoding, but the transition from ambition's cost to "wild magic" feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The chamber's repurposed cathedral crypt and the spectral light create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's themes and Milo's desperation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (light as conduit, madness as key) and a resonant ending elevate the story, though some metaphorical language borders on over-elaboration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh take on ambition/madness, with only minor over-reliance on "crumpled map" as a physical motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements harmonize well, and the brevity feels intentional, though the abrupt tonal shift to "irreverent awe" slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
