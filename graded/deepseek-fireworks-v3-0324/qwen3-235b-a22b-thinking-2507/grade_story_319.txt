<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's frailty and desperation are vividly portrayed, with his motivation to escape his predetermined fate driving every action. His use of the phial and carved messages reveals his resourcefulness and defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the phial's use and the tide's advance creating clear cause-and-effect tension. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the rebels' role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal island's oppressive atmosphere is masterfully evoked through sensory details (salt wind, peeling paint, sour smell). The setting amplifies Kael's isolation and the stakes of his escape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (painted rocks, dissolving smoke) and subtext (defiance vs. tyranny) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers with quiet triumph, though the rebels' involvement could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clich√©s. The "hopeful melancholy" tone is distinctive, though the phrase "resolutely wavering" feels slightly overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on freedom and resistance.</comment>
