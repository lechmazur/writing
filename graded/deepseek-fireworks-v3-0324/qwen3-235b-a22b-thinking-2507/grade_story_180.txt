<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conjurer's remorse and quest for inner peace are well-defined, but his backstory (hubris sinking ships) feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect. The resolution feels earned, though the yard sale framing could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”shipwrecks, silt, and algae-coated glass create a haunting, tactile immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (knitting needle as mender, microscope as key) and subtext about redemption. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "psychic cacophony"). Minor risk of ornate phrasing ("timbers shifting as if resonating").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. Elements serve the theme of rediscovery without feeling contrived.</comment>
