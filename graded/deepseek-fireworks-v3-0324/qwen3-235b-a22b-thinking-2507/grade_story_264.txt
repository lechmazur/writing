<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her 'unruly' and 'hauntingly cheerful' traits. Her use of the cracked lens and projector reveals her playful yet methodical nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's attempt to impress Vance. The tight word limit is managed well, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The story feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Tight word count is a strength, not a constraint.</comment>
