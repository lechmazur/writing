<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from spineless mercenary to reluctant hero is compelling, with clear motivation and consistent alignment with his traits. His "knack at vanishing" contrasts sharply with his ultimate choice to act, revealing depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the key's role driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the drowned dollhouse resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—the map projection room's dim glow and drowned quarter's eeriness amplify tension. Sensory details (brass orrery's pulse, warped dollhouse door) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key as trivial/sacred, silence as prophecy's medium) and subtext (fear vs. action) elevate the story. The ending's lingering doubt is poignant and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("voice fraying like old parchment") and nuanced emotion avoid cliché. The dollhouse key's role is strikingly original, defying tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic resonance. The story lingers beyond its final line.</comment>
