<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is compelling and deeply personal, driving her actions with quiet fury. Her sleep-deprived state and inventor role are well-integrated, though her "singularly plural" attribute could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from desperation to resolution. The DNA-to-bell method is inventive but slightly abrupt in execution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the neon orchard and cyberpunk setting enhancing the thematic weight. Sensory details (neon glow, subsonic hum) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (shame encoded in DNA, bell as transformation). Ending is poetic and resonant. Literary devices are used with precision and originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and approach. Metaphors ("prison walls of shame") feel fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told. Minor strain in blending cyberpunk and biological motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Elements serve the story organically. Lingers in the mind with its fusion of tech and emotional catharsis. Length feels deliberate and complete.</comment>
