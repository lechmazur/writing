<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from doubt to resolution. The action (strengthening the connection) drives the narrative effectively, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and mists create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (scent of books, cold mists) enhance mood and character immersion. The setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism in mists, scent as catalyst) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme could be slightly more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors (mists as doubt) and nuanced emotion. The style is distinct and avoids purple prose.</comment>
