<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and urgent, her actions align beautifully with her unique skill set, and her "clumsily dexterous" attribute adds a layer of humanizing contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc—introduction, execution, and resolution—all driven by Elara's methodical sonic manipulation. Pacing is impeccable for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cauldron room and stained glass fragment merge seamlessly into an eerie, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming glass, liquid shadow) elevate the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with potent symbolism (glass as a tuning fork, pantomime as mirror), subtext about collective guilt, and a hauntingly purposeful ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh—no tropes, no clichés. The "practical illusion" approach and the silent retribution concept are strikingly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant micro-masterpiece. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering weight of silence.</comment>
