<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation and internal conflict are richly explored, with his sobriety and sharpness adding depth. His emotional journey is clear and compelling, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the ink well's visions driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-covered island and "boisterously quiet" atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's haunting mood. Sensory details immerse the reader, though the coffee's cooling could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink well, coffee) and a layered theme of regret elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the "grudging admiration" twist feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, with fresh metaphors (e.g., the ink well as an "unforgiving lens"). Minor over-reliance on "boisterously quiet" slightly dampens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply thematic, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, though the dream-analysis method could feel more organic.</comment>
