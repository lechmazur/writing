<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's groggy brewer persona is vividly rendered, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His transformation from passivity to action is compelling, though slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and driven by the mirror shard's discovery. Pacing is tight but effective, though the transition from lull to protest resurgence could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with potent sensory details (e.g., "thick as unfermented wort"). The graveyard and mansion amplify tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, light/dark) and emotional resonance. Ending is purposeful, though the "flippant solemnity" theme feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("boiling kettle" for crowd voices). Avoids clich√©s, though "encroaching darkness" verges on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering impact, though the word limit strains thematic depth.</comment>
