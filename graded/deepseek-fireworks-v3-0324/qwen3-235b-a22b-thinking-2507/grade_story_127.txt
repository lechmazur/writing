<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his secret, with his actions and reactions revealing layers of guilt and love. His voice is distinct, especially in the raw, disused rasp when confronting Vex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the gauntlet triggering memory and driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the steampunk lounge feels underutilized as a setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details (hissing pipes, coral-like gauntlet), but the steampunk lounge lacks depth beyond aesthetic. The monsoon flashback is stronger than the present setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (gauntlet as bridge, rust as emotional block). Emotional resonance is high, and the ending is satisfying with nuanced subtext about creativity and redemption.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original handling of tropes (sworn adversaries, hidden secrets). Metaphors are fresh (e.g., "throat tightened like a rusted valve"). No AI-generic phrasing or abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Silas's future performances now that his block is shattered.</comment>
