<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his motivation to seek the ink blotter feels slightly forced—though his final rejection of it adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the resolution; the handshake moment is strong, but the pacing falters in the last paragraph.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (incense, sandstone) enriching the tension. The setting elevates the story’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter as mirror to paranoia) and subtext, though the ending’s epiphany leans slightly toward telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (broken constellations), but a few phrases edge toward purple prose ("shattered star patterns"). Nuanced handling of doubt vs. certainty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the tight word limit slightly truncates Aris’s emotional arc. The story lingers, though, thanks to its thematic resonance.</comment>
