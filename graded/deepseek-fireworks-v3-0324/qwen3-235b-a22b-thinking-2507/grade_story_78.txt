<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, blending grief with quiet determination. His 'softly militant' resolve is well-integrated, though the 'late-blooming hero' aspect feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from loss to stewardship. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the spyglass serves as a strong narrative anchor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm is vividly rendered, with sensory details (ash, filtered rain) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe ("first tear... final sigh") deepen the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spyglass, seedlings) and subtext. The ending is resonant, and the prose avoids sentimentality while evoking profound emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. No clich√©s or AI-like phrasing. The cosmic balance theme is handled with surprising depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on loss and resilience.</comment>
