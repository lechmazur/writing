<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her identity as a locksmith and preserver of culture. Her actions align well, though her 'nimble' trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the storm of secrets and prancing figure driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the metaphysical twist risks slight incoherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is breathtakingly original and immersive, with sensory details (creaking driftwood, lashing rain) amplifying the atmosphere. The orchard's metaphysical nature enhances the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting resonance about cultural preservation.</comment>
