<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer's motivation is clear and consistent, but their lack of distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance slightly limits engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The moon-path method subtly drives the narrative, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, and leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
