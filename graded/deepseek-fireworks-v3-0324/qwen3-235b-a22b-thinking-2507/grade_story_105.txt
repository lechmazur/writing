<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving her actions consistently. Her outcast status and scholarly pursuit of temporal theory are well-integrated, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the witch's garage feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The half-lit corridor and flying carpet garage are imaginative, but their connection to the seashell could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism and subtext. The "soul-mirror" theme resonates, and the ending is poignant. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "frantic peace" tone and temporal theory feel inventive, though some phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished work. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
