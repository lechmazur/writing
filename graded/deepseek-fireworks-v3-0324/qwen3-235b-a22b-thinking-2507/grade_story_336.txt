<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker's exhaustion and dedication are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in generational duty. His actions align perfectly with his established traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the car backfire serving as a clever disruption. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly truncates the climax's weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient Persian grandeur and modern alienation is masterfully evoked. Sensory details (electric lights, turquoise tiles) deepen the atmosphere, making the setting integral to the conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (clock as heart, darkness as void) and subtext (tradition vs. modernity) elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, though the prose occasionally verges on ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "placid ferocity" tone is striking, though some metaphors ("dropped crystal") feel slightly overused. Nuanced emotion shines through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of preserving fading wisdom.</comment>
