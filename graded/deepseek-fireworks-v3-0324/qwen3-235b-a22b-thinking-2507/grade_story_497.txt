<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and aligns well with her scholarly, daydreaming nature. Her reactions to the satellite shard and skating rink reveal depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the satellite and skating rink driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionalâ€”submerged palace and "pristine chaos" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., silt, glowing ice) enhance mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (light as compassion) and emotional resonance. Ending is poignant, though thematic depth slightly overshadows subtlety in conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Minor gripes: "seldom regular" feels slightly forced, and a few phrases border on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story transcends its constraints. Lingering impact is strong, though brevity limits fuller thematic exploration.</comment>
