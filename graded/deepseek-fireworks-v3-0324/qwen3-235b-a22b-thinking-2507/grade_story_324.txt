<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's insecurity and advisor role are well-integrated, shaping his hesitant yet desperate actions. His motivation is clear, though his transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the "jab" as a pivotal action. Coherence is strong, though the resolution leans on abstract realization over concrete payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with the HQ's decay mirroring Elias's doubt. Sensory details (echoing footsteps, pulsing brain) elevate tension effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The brain-in-a-jar trope is refreshed by its ambiguous role and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though brevity limits emotional resonance. Leaves a lingering question about authenticity vs. replication.</comment>
