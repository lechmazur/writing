<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's development is nuanced, with clear motivation and a distinct arc. His arrogance and eventual humility are well-portrayed, though his "sleepy nomad" trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect progression. The barbells serve as a perfect catalyst for thematic resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details (e.g., "weights scattered like fallen teeth"). The disguise room is intriguing but slightly jarring tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (barbells as hubris) and subtext. The ending is poignant and resonant, though Elara's dialogue borders on didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and thematically rich, avoiding clich√©s. The "spiritually material" concept is fresh, though the disguise room feels like an odd detour.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
