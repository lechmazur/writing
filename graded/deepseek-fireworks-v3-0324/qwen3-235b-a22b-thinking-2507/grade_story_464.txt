<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's sassy, rebellious nature is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions that reveal her contempt for order. Her academic mischief and 'drifting arrogance' make her distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marlowe's fracturing of reality driving a coherent arc. The escalation feels deliberate, and the pacing balances urgency with detail.</comment>
