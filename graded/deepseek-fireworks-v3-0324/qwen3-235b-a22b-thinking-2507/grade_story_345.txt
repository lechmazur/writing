<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly rendered with clear motivation and depth, his guilt and rebellion driving the narrative. The abacus symbolism powerfully reinforces his inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with jogging as both literal and metaphorical action. The resolution feels earned, though the snow-pattern method slightly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard is a masterclass in atmospheric worldbuilding—oppressive, surreal, and thematically resonant. Sensory details (frozen earth, groaning stalks) heighten immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (abacus, snow) and layered subtext elevate the storytelling. The ending lingers with quiet hope, though some metaphors verge on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh imagery avoid cliché. Minor quibbles: "dull radiance" repeats, and the orchard's grandeur might overshadow Marcus's personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve theme organically. The length feels deliberate, though the snow patterns slightly disrupt momentum.</comment>
