<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's stage fright in zero gravity is a striking, original flaw that deeply informs her actions. Her motivation (breaking generational lies) is clear but could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the climax. The coolant submersion ritual is inventive, though the key's role could be foreshadowed more organically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orbital debris/toy assembly contrast is masterful. Sensory details (wildflowers cutting skin, coolant burn) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wildflowers as stars, debris as raw material) and a haunting ending elevate this. Minor quibble: "defiant hush" repetition slightly overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality. No clichés; every detail (microgravity paralysis, sentient comms arrays) feels freshly imagined and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. Only the key’s sudden introduction slightly weakens the otherwise deliberate brevity.</comment>
