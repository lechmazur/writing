<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne's alien nature and teacher disguise are compelling, but her overprotectiveness could be more deeply explored. Her motivation to rescue knowledge is clear, though slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with logical cause-and-effect, though the climax (tile activation) leans slightly on convenience. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is vividly immersive, with exceptional sensory details (steam, organ notes). Atmosphere perfectly supports the story’s themes of hidden history and resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative prose with strong symbolism (organ as bridge, tile as key). Ending is satisfying, though Ms. Thorne’s internal shift from fear to freedom could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sound as universal bridge"). Minor AI-ish phrasing in describing emotions ("fierce tenderness" slightly overused).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the tile and bathhouse feel essential. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about humanity’s curiosity.</comment>
