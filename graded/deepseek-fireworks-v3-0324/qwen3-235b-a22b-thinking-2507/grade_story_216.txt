<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias Thorne's motivation as a scapegoat is compelling and consistent, with his actions revealing a deeply internalized role. His "voice" is distinct, though more dialogue could sharpen it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the washer's decoding driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative. The cloud city and washer are meaningfully connected, with sensory details (gas-lamp, brass bellows) enhancing atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (washer as fragile essence) and subtext (scapegoating as societal glue) elevate the story. Ending resonates, though deeper emotional stakes could amplify impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("robustly delicate") verge on overused. Nuanced handling of Elias's calm and fragility counters AI-like predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The story feels deliberate and layered, leaving a lingering question about the cost of borrowed guilt.</comment>
