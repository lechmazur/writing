<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into the narrative. His "elegantly clumsy" nature and ghostly interactions reveal a nuanced, introspective character with a distinct emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with Leo's action of dissecting the crown’s meaning driving the story toward a resonant resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab’s humid, salt-laden atmosphere is vividly rendered, amplifying the themes of impermanence. Sensory details (damp plaster, crumbling petals) elevate the ghostly melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (flower crown, sand castles) and subtext. The ending’s quiet catharsis is deeply affecting, and the prose is polished yet organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with no clichés. The handling of grief and release feels authentic, and metaphors (e.g., petals like ash) are fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich microcosm. Every element serves the story’s exploration of transience, and the brevity feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
