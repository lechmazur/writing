<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions align with his desire to wield power and mend time.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from setup to climax.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a broken planetarium and night club is vivid and thematically rich.

The ending resonates emotionally and philosophically, leaving a lingering sense of reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unconventional blending of elements (underwater welder + temporal mechanics).
