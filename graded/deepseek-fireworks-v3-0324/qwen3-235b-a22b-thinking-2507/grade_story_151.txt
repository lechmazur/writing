<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dr. Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, blending scientific awe with a rational approach to emotion. Her actions align with her "rationally organic" attribute, but her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from observation to resolution. The snowflake's symbolism drives the action logically, though the word limit slightly rushes the idol's destruction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the veil's brittleness, the idol's hum) immerse the reader and deepen the story's eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism, metaphor), the story evokes thought and emotion. The ending is satisfying, though the conflict's resolution could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "rationally organic" concept and snowflake method feel fresh, though the prose occasionally verges on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically resonant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering contemplation of fear’s dissolution.</comment>
