<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stoic wanderer's motivation is layered and compelling, with his inner conflict and past trauma subtly revealed. His actions align with his goal of preservation, though his voice could be slightly more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from entry to departure. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution could be marginally sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the mist-laced training ground and spectral foxes enriching the atmosphere. Sensory details like the floorboard's "humming" power are standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (the floorboard as both shield and archive) and subtext (lies as preservation). The ending resonates with thematic depth, though the teacher's role could be slightly expanded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("bland surface now a map of salvation"). Nuanced handling of emotion, though the wanderer's backstory is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished piece where elements serve the story elegantly. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of preservation vs. secrecy.</comment>
