<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but her urgency and emotional depth could be more consistently shown through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear, urgent arc, though the transition from memory-triggering to time-travel revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mountain peak and farmers market contrast brilliantly, heightening isolation and tension. Sensory details (wind, shifting ink) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baseball, shadows) and subtext (isolation vs. apocalypse). Ending is resonant but could linger more on emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The baseball as a time-travel artifact is particularly inventive. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("subdued her fear").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the farmers market feels underutilized. Short length works, though deeper character reflection would enhance impact.</comment>
