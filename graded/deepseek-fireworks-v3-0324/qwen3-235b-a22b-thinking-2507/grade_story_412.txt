<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's internal conflict and growth are vividly portrayed, with his "geographically challenged" attribute adding depth. His motivation to establish a new order is clear, though his "bookish assassin" duality could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cyclical nightmare structure is cohesive and drives tension effectively. The rubber key cover’s role as an anchor ties the beginning and end together with satisfying resolution.</comment>
