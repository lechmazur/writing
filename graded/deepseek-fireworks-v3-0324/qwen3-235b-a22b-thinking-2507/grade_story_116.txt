<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and consistent, with his 'subjectively rational' approach revealing depth. His use of the broken watch band as a tool rather than a timepiece is a clever twist.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the transition from polaroids to map feels slightly abrupt. The excavation metaphor ties everything together effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sky-lounge and city setting are vividly immersive, with sensory details (jasmine, neon) enhancing the surreal atmosphere. The black velvet void contrasts beautifully with the city's sprawl.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (watch band = time's irrelevance) and subtext (mapping the unknowable). The ending is satisfying, though the 'laconic exuberance' tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The minstrel's nuanced excavation of memories feels human, not algorithmic. Some phrases ("laconic exuberance") border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity works; the map’s completion lingers as a triumph against oblivion.</comment>
