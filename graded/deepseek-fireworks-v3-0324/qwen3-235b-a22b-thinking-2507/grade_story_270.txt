<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas is vividly realized—his "humbly arrogant" nature and fading conjurer's pride drive his desperate, solitary quest to decode the globe. His motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply tied to his isolation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly compressed: his harmonic experiment with the lighthouse's acoustics logically leads to the globe's awakening. Pacing is tight, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is lushly atmospheric—mildew, salt, and echoing stone amplify the melancholy. The lighthouse/library fusion is inspired, with sensory details that immerse and elevate the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext (ephemerality, legacy), the story balances poetic imagery with purpose. The ending's revelation—shared striving across time—resonates deeply. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and hauntingly fresh. Avoids clichés; the "echo in a canyon" method feels inventive. Nuanced emotion and style distinguish it from algorithmic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful vignette. Elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering meditation on time and connection. Feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
