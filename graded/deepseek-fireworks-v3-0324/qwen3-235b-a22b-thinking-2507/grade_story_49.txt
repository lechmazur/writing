<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris is vividly rendered through his "lukewarm" magic and peculiar loyalty, but his internal struggle occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's tight arc—from fragile hope to confrontation with collective dread—is masterfully executed, though the fog machine's role borders on overly convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar base's sterile chill and "charred serenity" are immersive, with the doormat’s tactile details grounding the story’s cosmic scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (doormat as threshold, fog as canvas) and a resonant ending that lingers without overt exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "lukewarm mage" risks leaning into trope; the emotional nuance in Aris’s persistence elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the brevity amplifying its thematic weight—only the fog machine slightly strains credulity.</comment>
