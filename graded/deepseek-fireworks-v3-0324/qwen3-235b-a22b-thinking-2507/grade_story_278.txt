<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's brooding nature and sculptor’s hands are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation (escaping servitude) and a hauntingly consistent reaction to the sunbeam.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the disappearance method feeling surreal yet inevitable. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the "webs of intrigue" subplot lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lunar base’s oppressive atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (dust, lye, sunbeam) deepening the mood. The setting amplifies Elias’s isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the dust-as-language metaphor, the poignant ending, and the layered theme of dissolution into beauty. Every word serves the story’s impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of sci-fi and lyrical despair feels fresh, and the prose is precise without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements merge seamlessly, and the brevity amplifies its power. Leaves a lingering ache.</comment>
