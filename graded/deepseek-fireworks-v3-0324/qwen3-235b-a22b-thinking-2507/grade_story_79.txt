<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is vividly clear and consistent, with his ghostly resolve and rebellion against grief deeply shaping his actions. His distinct voice and personality shine through, though his background as a sheriff could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolve. The meteor shower clue and chain's tarnish create logical cause-and-effect, though the library's role could be more dynamic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (dust motes, cool pressure) and the library's hushed embrace elevating tension. The setting and timeframe harmonize flawlessly with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors ("dirge of despair"), layered subtext, and a resonant ending. The theme of defiance against sorrow is evoked through stellar imagery and subtle emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("silent fall sings the clearest song"). Nuanced handling of grief and rebellion, though the sheriff archetype leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering question about communal healing, though the tight word limit slightly constrains the ridge's payoff.</comment>
