<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is sharply defined and consistently drives her actions, with her "cynically gentle" nature adding depth to her rebellion. Her grief and precision in lunar observation create a compelling, distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the contagion's spread and the moon's alignment creating clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent, though the time machine garage feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is richly immersive, with sensory details (burnt sugar, rustling shadows) amplifying the mystical rebellion. The garage clashes tonally but enhances the contagion's uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (violets as time capsules) and subtext (memory as contagion). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding tropes. The contagion metaphor is fresh, though "shadows learn to speak" edges toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ingenious fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with haunting elegance.</comment>
