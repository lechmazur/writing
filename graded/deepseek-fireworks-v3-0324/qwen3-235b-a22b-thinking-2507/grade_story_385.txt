<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's manipulative kindness is well-defined, but her motivation feels slightly detached from her actions; the skates’ symbolism is strong but not fully integrated into her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed in connecting the skates, seeds, and footprints. The ending is satisfying, but the middle lacks rhythmic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward blend beautifully, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, transient mood. The setting elevates the story’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Symbolism is potent but occasionally overbearing. The ending resonates, but some metaphors feel forced ("seeds weakening soil"). Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases border on ornate. Emotional nuance is subtle and well-handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, though the skyscraper feels underutilized. The brevity works, leaving a haunting, lingering effect.</comment>
