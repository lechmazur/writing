<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his past as a storm chaser informing his present actions. His "eagerly unwilling" nature adds nuance, though this could be slightly more developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with decoding the tapestry serving as a logical pivot. The carousel’s restoration arc feels complete despite brevity, though the "between tasks" timeframe slightly dilutes urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and desert contrast is masterful, with sensory details (icy stone, frayed threads) deepening atmosphere. The setting actively shapes Elias’ growth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: symbolism (tongs/tapestry as tools of mending), layered theme (creation healing fracture), and a resonant ending. Shows far more than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original: storm chaser in a monastery, carousel mechanics encoded in tapestry. Avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("ghostly horses pulled at his core").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and profound. Elements serve the story’s soul—quiet restoration mirrors inner healing. Leaves a lingering awe for craftsmanship’s spiritual power.</comment>
