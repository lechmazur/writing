<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's quiet discipline and personal quest for grace are subtly but effectively conveyed, though his impassivity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Aris's ritual and the orchard's resonance creating a satisfying arc despite the brevity. Pacing is deliberate but not sluggish.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is breathtakingly original, with sensory details (grease, bees, crumbling stone) deepening the atmosphere and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—grace in mundanity, resilience in decay—and masterful use of imagery (the gilded bee, the twist tie as relic). Ending lingers poignantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (bees as translators) and avoidance of cliché. Some phrasing borders on ornate but never feels algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a story that feels expansive despite its length. The twist tie and bees elevate the ordinary to the sacred.</comment>
