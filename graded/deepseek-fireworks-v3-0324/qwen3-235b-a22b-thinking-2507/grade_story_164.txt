<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's wistful nature and his quiet rebellion through botanical drawings are well-developed, but his "drifting arrogance" feels under-explored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s quiet, introspective arc is coherent, but the cyberpunk arcade setting feels minimally utilized beyond atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade’s contrast with Kael’s organic longing is evocatively rendered, though the "between acts" timeframe lacks urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the conflict (reclamation vs. urban decay) leans more thematic than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh in concept, but occasional phrases ("drifted arrogance") verge on overwrought. The botanical focus avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant vignette that transcends its word limit, though the cyberpunk elements feel secondary to Kael’s internal journey.</comment>
