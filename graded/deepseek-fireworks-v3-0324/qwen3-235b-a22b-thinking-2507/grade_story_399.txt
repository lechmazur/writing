<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mandala and tube driving a clear arc from tension to resolution. Pacing is masterful, and cause-and-effect is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (chill of the tube, refracted starlight) deepen the mood and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (mandala as trauma's map) and subtext. The ending is profound, and the theme of integrating pain resonates memorably.</comment>
