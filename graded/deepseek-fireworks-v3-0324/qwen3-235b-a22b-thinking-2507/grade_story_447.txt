<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her actions—her defiance and dedication to mending the community shine through. The stuffed toy ear as a utensil adds a poignant layer to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the dissolution of the bulletins driving the narrative forward. The cause-and-effect logic is strong, though the pacing feels slightly compressed in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "amber prison" setting is evocative, and sensory details (broth, steam, scent) deepen the atmosphere. The abandoned toy factory connection enhances the mood of lost innocence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the ear, dissolving bulletins) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the central conflict—community fracture vs. unity—is resolved with subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoids clichés, and employs fresh metaphors (e.g., "amber prison"). Emotional resonance is shown through action, not stated. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, prompting reflection on collective healing. Stylish yet purposeful prose.</comment>
