<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's conscientious objector status and motivation to map migration routes are well-integrated, revealing depth through his pacifism and familial legacy. His "valiantly bored" demeanor adds nuance, though his dialogue could further distinguish his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the migration mapping tradition and developer confrontation creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the neighborhood watch element feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and storm-battered setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension and Silas's vigilance. Coy malevolence seeps into every detail, though sensory immersion could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (rusty nail, storms) and subtext (pacifism vs. protection). The ending is sharp and resonant, with literary craft elevating the narrative beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The orchard's "coy malevolence" and Silas's quiet defiance feel fresh. Minor quibble: "xenial" slightly overused in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with assigned elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering unease about land and legacy.</comment>
