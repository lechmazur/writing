<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gareth's academic rebellion and knightly decorum are well-balanced, but his "laconic exuberance" feels slightly underdeveloped in dialogue. His motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the championship match's relevance fades too quickly. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The luminous swamp is vividly immersive, with sensory details (algae pulses, cool shell) enhancing atmosphere. Setting and object are perfectly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shell as compass, swamp's verdant clock) and subtext (rebirth vs. rigid honor) elevate the story. Dialogue is sharp; ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original twist on knightly tropes with fresh metaphors ("swamp breathed with him"). No AI clich√©s, though "converging destinies" borders on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements serve the story seamlessly. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a haunting promise of untold legends.</comment>
