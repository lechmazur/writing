<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "openly secretive" nature and motivations are well-integrated, though her midwife role could be more explicitly tied to her actions. Her arc from isolation to shared stewardship is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent, with clear cause-and-effect, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The tight word limit handles the arc well, though pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom are vividly rendered, with sensory details (herbs, charred pages) enhancing atmosphere. The "dissonant calm" tone is expertly sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herbs, diaries) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of shared wisdom could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original in voice and perspective, avoiding clich√©s. Some descriptors verge on overly precise, but the emotional resonance feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering thematic impact. Only minor tightening would elevate it further.</comment>
