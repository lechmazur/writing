<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong character development; Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into her actions. The woman's reaction to the hair tie reveals layers of desperation and resilience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced within constraints. The action (weatherizing) drives the narrative meaningfully, though the "planning" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the steam-powered setting enhances the story’s tone and themes. Sensory details (hissing pipes, ink shimmering) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative and layered storytelling. Literary devices (symbolism of ink, steam as deceit) are masterfully employed. Ending is purposeful and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. No clichés; metaphors (e.g., "ink like liquid obsidian") are fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate use of elements. The story lingers, offering depth beyond its length. Creative combination of steampunk and existential themes.</comment>
