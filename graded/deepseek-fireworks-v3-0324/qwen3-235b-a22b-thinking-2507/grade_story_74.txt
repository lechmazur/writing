<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's minimalist nature and escape motivation are clear and consistent, but his "aloofly intimate" demeanor could be deepened to reveal more interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sequence 3-7-2 driving the narrative logically toward rebellion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The primordial setting and sterile study center contrast brilliantly, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (damp stone, glistening rock) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (missing joker, tidal turn) and subtext (flaws in perfection) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful and haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("became a ripple himself") and nuanced handling of rebellion avoid clich√©s. The AI-overmind premise feels original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about resistance in sterile systems.</comment>
