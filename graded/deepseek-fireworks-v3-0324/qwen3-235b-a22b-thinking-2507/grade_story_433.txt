<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's hardheadedness and fractured spirit are consistently portrayed, driving her actions convincingly. Her motivation to seek solace aligns well with her traits, though her "wholeheartedly broken" state could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with prophecy fragments and the secret book safe driving the narrative toward a clear resolution. Pacing is effective, though the snow's role as a sealing force feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ephemeral gallery and snow days create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ice groaning, aged paper scent) enhance mood brilliantly, though the dissolving ice mural's symbolism could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent metaphors (melting sculptures as fragile hope) and a resonant theme. The ending's emotional impact is profound, though the "demure audacity" tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, though "price of power" leans slightly tropey. The prose avoids purple tendencies, but a few phrases ("wholeheartedly broken") flirt with overstatement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative microcosm. The elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic weight, though the prophecy's mechanics could feel less abstract.</comment>
