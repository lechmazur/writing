<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Aris Thorne's dual role as physician and epigrapher is compelling, and his desperation to decode the inscriptions is clear and consistent. His exhaustion and reliance on coffee grounds add depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual's urgency driving the narrative. Cause and effect are logical, and the pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the jungle-meets-sea camp and the temple's eerie atmosphere enhancing tension. Sensory details (salt-eroded grooves, crashing waves) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (coffee visions, glowing inscriptions) and subtext (rewriting fate). The ending is satisfying, and the conflict—man vs. curse—is gripping.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fusion of archaeology and occult ritual feels inventive, and the coffee-ground method is unexpected yet logical. Minor overuse of atmospheric adjectives.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering tension—will the sea keep its secrets?—adds depth.</comment>
