<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's apathy is deeply woven into his actions and reactions, with a clear shift in motivation that feels organic despite his lethargy. His 'enthusiastically lazy' nature is a standout trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the obsidian shard and river wisdom creating a logical cause-and-effect chain. Pacing is deliberate, though the tight word count slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The decaying studio and "gentle sharpness" of absence create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, obsidian shard) enrich the world without overloading it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: river wisdom as both metaphor and literal blueprint elevates the narrative. The ending is purposeful, with layered themes of regeneration and purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés with fresh imagery (e.g., "river wisdom" as coral knowledge). Nuanced emotion and subtext prevent it from feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively, leaving a resonant impact. The brevity feels intentional, with creative interplay between the dying god’s breath and earthly grit.</comment>
