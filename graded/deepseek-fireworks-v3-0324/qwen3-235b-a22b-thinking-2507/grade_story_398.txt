<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the shared dream serving as a pivotal moment that bridges despair and hope. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite the brevity. Logical cause-and-effect relationships are maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary's tactile, auditory details ("clicking looms," "salt-sting of tears") create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of resilience, and the "between waves" timeframe reinforces the cyclical tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh metaphors (e.g., "dysfunctionally functional looms as resilience"). No clich√©s or AI-generated tropes. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated, and the style is distinctively lyrical yet purposeful.</comment>
