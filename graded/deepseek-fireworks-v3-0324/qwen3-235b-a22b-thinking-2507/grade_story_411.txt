<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is deeply compelling and consistent, his "repulsively attractive" chrome limbs and hydraulic fingers adding a unique, mechanical-yet-delicate touch to his character. His grief-laden purpose is revealed through meticulous study and sorting, aligning perfectly with his role as a mender of unsaid confessions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, moving from gathering to resolution with a clear arc. The slow drip of starlight and the dissolving of fragments provide a natural rhythm, avoiding rushed or disjointed pacing despite the word limit. The connection between beginning (gathering) and end (release) is poignant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and star-river create a mesmerizing, otherworldly atmosphere. The setting is seamlessly woven into Silas's task, with luminescent fruit and mossy stones reinforcing the story's melancholic yet mystical tone. Sensory details (condensed starlight tears, iridescent oil) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices: the opera glasses as a symbol of perception, the fragments as metaphors for unspoken grief. The ending is devastatingly satisfying, blending sorrow and joy. The theme of giving voice to silence is layered and resonant, prompting deep reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "hydraulic fingers surprisingly delicate"). No clichés or formulaic phrasing. The fusion of mechanical and emotional elements feels inventive, and the prose avoids purple excess while remaining lush. Emotion is shown through action (starlight tears, sensor overload).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful blend of elements. The story transcends its constraints, feeling deliberate rather than limited. The lingering question—how much grief can Silas bear?—adds haunting depth. Every detail serves the narrative’s emotional core.</comment>
