<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas' motivation is clear and compelling, but his "feral elegance" is more told than shown. His backstory as a brewer of radio frequencies adds depth, though it could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. The lullaby method is inventive, but the urgency of the escape sequence slightly overshadows the "crossroads" concept.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the abandoned circus tent and analog-digital transition creating a haunting, immersive mood. Sensory details are striking and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sunflower, projector) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional weight of the child’s fate could be deepened further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The writing style is distinctive, but "feral elegance" feels slightly overworked. Nuanced handling of emotion and worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements working in harmony. Leaves a lingering question about resistance and loss in a dystopian world.</comment>
