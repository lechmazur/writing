<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her interaction with the flytraps reveals her eccentric yet determined personality. The "comically serious" attribute is well-integrated but could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the ionizer action driving the reveal effectively. The word limit is well-managed, but the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Himalayan tea house setting is vividly atmospheric, using sensory details to enhance the mood. The unexplained phenomena integrate seamlessly with the high-altitude mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., Agnes' fickle loyalty as symbolism) and a memorable premise. Some emotional depth could be further mined in Elara's reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghostly, shifting lines") and no clich√©s. The voice is distinctive, though the "comically serious" tone occasionally borders on overdone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the brevity slightly undercuts thematic depth.</comment>
