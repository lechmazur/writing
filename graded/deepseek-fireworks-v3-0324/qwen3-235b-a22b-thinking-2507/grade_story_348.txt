<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's somnambulist state and humility are deeply integrated into her actions, making her motivation and personality distinct. Her reverence for the woodland secrets is consistent and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from her pilgrimage to the lab's revelation, with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight but deliberate, though the word limit slightly truncates the climax.</comment>
