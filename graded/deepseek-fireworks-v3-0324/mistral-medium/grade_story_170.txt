<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's free-spirited nature and herbalist role are well-integrated, but her "academically artistic" attribute feels underexplored. Her motivation is clear but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and avoids abrupt shifts, but the connection between the wall, letters, and reef restoration could be tighter. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coral station and abandoned wall create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details like the sewing kit's "cool brass latch" enrich the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (stitching doubt into cloth) is powerful, and the ending satisfies. Some metaphors verge on overworked ("threads of doubt").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the coral-station setting and sewing-as-therapy metaphor, but "hollow echoes" edges toward cliché. Nuanced emotion balances minor stylistic excesses.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole, though the wall's significance feels slightly detached. The brevity serves the story’s introspective tone.</comment>
