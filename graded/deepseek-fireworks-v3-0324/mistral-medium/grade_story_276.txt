<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emissary's unease and obsession with cosmic patterns are vividly portrayed, and his actions align well with his motivation. However, his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from unease to revelation. The coathanger antenna and postcard map drive the narrative effectively, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris station is richly atmospheric, and the juxtaposition of domestic details (postcards, fridge) with cosmic scale enhances the tone. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (coathanger as key, postcards as map) and offers profound subtext about redemption and chance. The ending is both satisfying and hauntingly open-ended.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "branches of redemption" and accidental wisdom feel inventive, though some metaphors (e.g., "rustling paper") border on overused.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with each element serving the story’s depth. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering fascination with cosmic patterns and human fragility.</comment>
