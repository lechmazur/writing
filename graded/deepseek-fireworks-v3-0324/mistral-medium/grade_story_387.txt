<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's selflessness is subtly but effectively conveyed, and his motivation to map the migration of souls is clear and consistent. However, his 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue or internal reflection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tightly woven, with a clear arc from longing to resolution. Pacing is strong, though the final leap into the nebula feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with vivid sensory details (vinyl crackles, wind chimes) enhancing the atmosphere. The recycled spaceship and nebula setting amplify the themes of trust and migration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vinyl as map, chimes as guides) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the 'mark of trust' could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, though phrases like "savage grace" flirt with overused poeticism. The fusion of sci-fi and mythic elements feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully into a cohesive whole. The brevity serves the story, leaving a haunting, resonant effect.</comment>
