<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's ambivalence is vividly portrayed, and his ritualistic meal reveals deep loneliness and defiance. Motivation is clear, but the druid's guardedness could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the meal ritual elegantly ties beginning to end. Pacing is strong, though the crevasse's significance feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—glacial orchard and crevasse create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (brittle apples, howling wind) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (safety pin, meal) and subtext. Ending is poignant, and the theme of solitude resonates. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors (breath like a question). Style is distinct, avoiding AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. Story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Lingering impact—silence "humming" is a standout.</comment>
