<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and aligns with his traits, but the "delightfully dull" attribute isn't fully explored, leaving some personality depth unfulfilled.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The tunnel discovery feels abrupt but serves the mystery's escalation.</comment>
