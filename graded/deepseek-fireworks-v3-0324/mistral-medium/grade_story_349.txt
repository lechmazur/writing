<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilot's cynicism and hope are well-balanced, but his motivation could be clearer—why scatter the herbs specifically?</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves logically, but the speed-dating encounter feels abrupt. The ending’s resolution is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is stellar—sensory details (herbs, observatory) immerse deeply, though the orchard’s fate lacks urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (herbs as memory) resonates, but "horizons of mercy" feels underdeveloped. Emotional impact is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés, though "charred serenity" edges toward overwrought. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "fleeting constellation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. Short length serves the mood, but some concepts (mercy, speed dating) needed more room.</comment>
