<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's quiet deserter status and his interactions with the masks and mirror reveal deep introspection and a nuanced arc of self-discovery, though his "dizzyingly grounded" attribute could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is cohesive and driven by the act of reconstruction, with a clear arc from fragmentation to wholeness. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the "carbonize" action feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plant communication study is evocative and enhances the atmosphere, but the connection between plants and porcelain masks could be more deeply explored for stronger synergy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered themes of belonging and transformation elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "noble foolishness" tone occasionally clashes with the introspective mood.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clichés. The metaphors (e.g., carbonization) are fresh, though some phrasing ("dizzyingly grounded") feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and thought-provoking piece where elements serve the narrative. The word limit feels deliberate, but the "jigsaw puzzles" timeframe could be more seamlessly woven in.</comment>
