<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-defined with cautious adventurousness, but his inner conflict and depth could be sharper; motivation is clear but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the underwater library reveal feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent library and "earthbound flight" tone create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details (salt, old paper) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong themes of memory and reverence, with effective symbolism (bent spoke as relic). Ending resonates, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids tropes, but phrases like "whispering through the currents" edge toward clich√©. Nuance in Elias's transformation elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the theme. Length feels deliberate, though the dog park meeting slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
