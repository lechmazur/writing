<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the dealer's intervention feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The resonance facility and desert orchard are hauntingly evocative, with sensory details (humming skull, pulsing walls) that deepen the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's melancholic magic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (skull as key, orchard as silence) and emotional resonance. The ending is transcendent, blending prophecy and renewal with layered subtext.</comment>
