<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's analytical innovation and motivation to unearth truth are compelling, though their "nondescript" nature slightly undermines depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's tight arc and pacing are flawless, with encryption-unraveling as a strong driving action. Minor quibble: the "surprise party" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”rain and tower merge into a haunting, electric mood. Sensory details (scent, sound) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful craft: layered symbolism (rain as cleansing/justice), resonant ending, and theme of balance. Only lacks deeper dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("rain a storm in their veins") and originality in blending tech/myth. Slight over-reliance on "weight" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. Elements serve the story; brevity feels deliberate, leaving satisfying thematic resonance.</comment>
