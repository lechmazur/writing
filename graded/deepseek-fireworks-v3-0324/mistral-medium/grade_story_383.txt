<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The general's transformation from burdened to liberated is compelling, though his military background feels underutilized. His motivation (dethroning fear) is clear but somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured with a clear arc, though the "between rides" concept slightly disrupts pacing. The photograph as a catalyst is elegant and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner's cosmic noir atmosphere is vivid and immersive, though the "dark matter" label feels slightly gimmicky. Sensory details (neon, static) enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism (arcs as lifelines, seaweed as relics) and subtext. The ending is resonant, though the waitress's role edges on deus ex machina.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fearâ€™s throne"), though "mischievous wisdom" tone wobbles between playful and profound.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers as a meditation on shedding past selves.</comment>
