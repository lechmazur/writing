<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is clear and consistent, with her "sweetly fierce" determination driving her actions. The fan and genetic limitations reveal depth, though her "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the walkie-talkie element feels slightly abrupt. The arc from ruin to rebirth is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground fairy city and neon park are vividly rendered, with crystalline walls and pulsing fire enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fan as torch) and subtext (illusion vs. belief). The ending is purposeful, though the walkie-talkie disrupts the mood slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The "memory of fire" and Liora’s defiance feel fresh, though some phrases edge toward florid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
