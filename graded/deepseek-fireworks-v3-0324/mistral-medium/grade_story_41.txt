<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and compelling, blending academic rebellion with cosmic ambition. His transformation feels earned, though his "academically wild" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the ritual's mechanics remain vague. The abyss and brooch connection could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, with the gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss creating palpable tension. Sensory details elevate the mood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette. The elements serve the story, though the cosmic shift could be more grounded in character.</comment>
