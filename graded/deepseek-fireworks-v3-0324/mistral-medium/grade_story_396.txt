<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, but her forgetfulness feels underutilized. Her voice is distinct, though actions could better reflect her urban forager trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing is tight, but the science fair's role is unclear. Cause/effect logic holds, though the climax feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vault and Parisian underworld are vividly rendered. Sensory details (e.g., glass's warmth, music) deepen atmosphere. Setting elevates tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, but "disinterested passion" feels forced. Nuanced emotion, though prose occasionally over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but science fair and forgetfulness distract slightly. Lingering thematic weight saves cohesion.</comment>
