<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, but his rebellious nature feels slightly underutilized in driving action. The paper flower's symbolism is strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; transitions between scenes could be smoother. The laundromat estrangement feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enriching the setting. The study's "haunting delight" is particularly effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite constraints, though a few elements feel forced. Leaves a lingering sense of transformation.</comment>
