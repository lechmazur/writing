<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intriguing, but his "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his role, but his internal voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a strong arc, though the transition to the roller coaster track feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—sensory details (rusted rails, damp metal) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that amplifies the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doorknob, erosion) and a haunting ending elevate the story. The theme of the journey as the riddle is executed with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The "quiet mania" tone and surreal premise feel fresh, though minor phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking tale where elements serve the story masterfully. Leaves a lingering existential question.</comment>
