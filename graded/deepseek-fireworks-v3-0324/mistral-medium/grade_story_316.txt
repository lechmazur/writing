<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seamstress's timidity and seraphic nature create a compelling contrast with her bold action of overtaking silence. Her motivation (childhood promise) is clear but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with the scoreboard and typewriter ribbon weaving a logical arc. Pacing is tight but effective, though the arcade element feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The temple's reimagining as a sanctuary is masterful, with ivy-draped columns and humming air creating vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (whistle, ink, sighing stones) are exceptionally immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ribbon as relic, scoreboard as guide) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "scattered harmony" concept could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, but the seamstress's "seraphic" label borders on cliché. The arcade scoreboard feels slightly incongruous with the temple setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic weight—mending as defiance.</comment>
