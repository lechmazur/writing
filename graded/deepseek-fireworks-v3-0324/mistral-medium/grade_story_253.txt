<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is compelling with clear motivation ("master of time") and emotional depth ("shattered allegiances"), though his "politeness" as a bandit could be more uniquely justified.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot arcs well within constraints, but the harp metaphor feels somewhat forced as a "method." Pacing is strong, though the rival's arrival is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "electronic wilderness refuge" is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("hummed with forgotten algorithms"), though the classroom timeframe adds little.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth ("healing over power") and symbolism (chip as key), but the ending's redemption feels slightly rushed. Prose is lyrical but controlled.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with nuanced emotion, though "proud humility" as tone isn't fully distinct. Avoids clich√©s but the harp metaphor leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story. Length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant thematic question about mending time.</comment>
