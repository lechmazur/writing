<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The steward's defiance and reverence for the cameo are compelling, though his "stoic" nature could be further nuanced to avoid predictability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence shines within tight constraints, with the crate and labels driving tension logically. Minor pacing hiccups near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric detail (crushed blossoms, candlelight) immerses the reader; the museum's miniaturized oppression is hauntingly vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (cracks, cameo) is potent, though the ending's "masterpiece" metaphor feels slightly overworked. Subtext on rebellion resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (e.g., "ink smelling of orchard blossoms") avoids clich√©. The steward's quiet rebellion feels original, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered vignette. The brevity amplifies its thematic weight, leaving a lingering question about preservation vs. defiance.</comment>
