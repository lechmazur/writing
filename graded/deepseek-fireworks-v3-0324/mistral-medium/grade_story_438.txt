<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mystic's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "discreetly flamboyant" nature feels underdeveloped. His defiance and recklessness are well-aligned with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a strong sense of cause-and-effect. The override action drives the narrative powerfully, though the polaroid method feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lab's sterile contrast with the mystic's mysticism is vivid, but the timeframe ("after the last star map") could be more integrated. Sensory details (humming compass, synthetic scent) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (compass as symbol, polaroids as fragmented truth). The ending is resonant, and the theme of rewriting history is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Some phrases ("hollow recklessness") flirt with over-ornamentation, but the voice is distinct and the emotional resonance genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, innovative story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering impact—questioning truth and memory—is potent.</comment>
