<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's introverted empathy and quiet determination are consistently portrayed, with their actions and reactions revealing depth. Their motivation—championing outcasts—is clear and aligns well with their personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and achieves resolution within the word limit, though the marionette's sudden sentience slightly strains logic. Pacing is well-managed, but the pirates' swift transformation feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout's drowsy, cavernous atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (brittle starfish, echoing laughter) enhancing mood. The setting and object meaningfully intertwine with the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (starfish, marionette) and subtext, though the marionette's dialogue veers toward cliché. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of reassembling brokenness resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the marionette's role and starfish symbolism, but "drowsy enthusiasm" feels underdeveloped. Some phrases verge on flowery, though the core concept avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite tight constraints, the story feels deliberate and cohesive. Elements serve the narrative, and the blend of sci-fi and wisdom-tale aesthetics leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
