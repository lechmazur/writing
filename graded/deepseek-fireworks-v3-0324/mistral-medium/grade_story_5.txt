<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with guarded depth and theoretical whimsy. His motivation to preserve wisdom is clear, and his actions align, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from hesitation to action. Pacing is excellent, and the amulet's role as a key drives coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The power plant’s decay and humming atmosphere are hauntingly immersive. Sensory details (rusted pipes, seashell glow) elevate the mood and connect to Elias’s journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell, amulet) and layered subtext about wisdom’s burden. The ending satisfies while lingering, and the style enhances the story’s weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (nightmares as ink) feel precise, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
