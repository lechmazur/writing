<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's irony as a humorless comedic actor is compelling, and his motivation to bottle a star's breath is absurd yet thematically resonant. However, his "silence for depth" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic works, but the tight word limit forces abrupt transitions (e.g., inkwell to stardust). Pacing wobbles near the end, though the arc reaches a satisfying resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The deserted playground and wilderness merge beautifully with the tone—evocative sensory details (rusted swings, shadows like punchlines) elevate the atmosphere. Only slight overuse of "emptiness" metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (inkwell as barren wit) and subtext about creative failure. The ending is poignant, though the "laughter" moment feels abrupt. Literary craft is polished but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "time’s unraveling tapestry"). Minimal clichés, though the "fading career" trope is familiar. Emotion is shown, not stated, with nuanced melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the star-breath motif slightly overshadows the inkwell's potential. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about artistic redemption.</comment>
