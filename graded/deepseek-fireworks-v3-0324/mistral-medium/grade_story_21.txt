<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diplomat's motivation is clear, but his internal conflict could be deeper. The tassel as a symbol of past failures is strong, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The genetic decoding feels abrupt, and the revenge arc resolves too quickly for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with excellent sensory details. The theater and drum circles enhance the mood, but the city hall's decay could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's emotional impact is muted. The theme of revenge is clear but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The tassel and genetic patterns feel fresh, though the "abrasive calm" tone wobbles.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but the length strains under the weight of its themes. Some elements (e.g., genetic decoding) feel underdeveloped.</comment>
