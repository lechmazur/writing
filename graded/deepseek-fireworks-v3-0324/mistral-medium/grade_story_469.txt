<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and layered, with the skeleton key necklace serving as a potent symbol of his past and drive. His "logically emotional" nature is well-integrated, though slightly more internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed, with the countdown and overreaching action creating urgency. The resolution feels earned, though the final reveal of bones could be slightly more foreshadowed for coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—sensory details (garden scent, whispering gallery) deepen immersion. The setting actively shapes tension and character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and symbolic use of the necklace. The ending lingers, though the "grandiose modesty" tone occasionally overshadows emotional subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh in execution, avoiding clichés. The garden scent as a method is inventive, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story’s depth. The length feels deliberate, and the smuggler’s transformation into a "keeper" is a standout touch.</comment>
