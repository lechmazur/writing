<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's sharp-wittedness and linguistic ineptitude create a compelling contrast, driving her reliance on dance. Her motivation—fulfilling the prophecy—is clear, though her denial feels slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent, but the chamber's role is vague. Pacing is strong, though the "twist" revelation could be sharper. Cause-and-effect holds, but the prophecy's mechanics lack clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with celestial dance and sterile chamber contrasting beautifully. Sensory details (patch's cold metal, steam) enhance mood, but "bubble bath" feels oddly whimsical for the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the patch, dance as rebirth) are potent. Ending is hauntingly satisfying, though the prophecy's ambiguity slightly weakens thematic punch. Emotional resonance is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending dance with cosmic prophecy. Some phrases ("bubble bath of false comfort") verge on overwrought, but subversion of tropes (survivor's guilt as rebirth) feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite complexity. Style elevates clarity, and the brief length suits the fable-like tone. Lingers on loss and renewal, though chamber's purpose could be sharper.</comment>
