<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation ("to escape a simulated reality") is clear and consistent, but his "literally unique" attribute could be more deeply explored to add nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from burden to liberation, though the transition from "between shows" to the simulation's collapse could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is evocatively rendered, with decay and light used to amplify the sentinel's isolation and the fragility of his melodies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism (coins, pamphlet) and emotional resonance; the ending is both cathartic and open-ended, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, though the "weight of remembering" leans slightly toward abstraction. Avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "seams of simulation") risk familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole, with the brief length serving the story's meditative pace. The lingering question of authenticity lingers powerfully.</comment>
