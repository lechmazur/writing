<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' selective mutism and ventriloquism are deeply integrated into his character, revealing his coping mechanisms and optimism. His motivation (archiving weather for his sister) is poignant but slightly underdeveloped in this short format.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from longing to acceptance. The parallel universe beach feels abrupt but doesn’t derail the emotional core.</comment>
