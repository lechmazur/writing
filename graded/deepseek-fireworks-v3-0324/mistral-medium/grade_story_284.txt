<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's stoicism and emotional depth are well-rendered, but his pirate radio background feels underutilized. The beekeeper’s irony and earnestness are compelling, though her backstory is sparse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with the paper plane as a superb unifying symbol. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the pirate radio detail feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s atmosphere is vividly immersive, with sensory details (bees, honey, dusk) enhancing mood. The bar band’s note feels less integrated but doesn’t detract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (paper plane, bees) and layered subtext (fear, freedom) elevate this. Dialogue is sparse but potent. The ending is resonant and thematically satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clichés. The pirate radio operator element is the weakest link, but the rest feels fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant micro-story. Elements like the sanctuary and paper plane are indispensable. Only the pirate radio feels extraneous.</comment>
