<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a compelling character with clear motivation, but his "sober cardsharp" trait feels underutilized. The ink well and dreams drive his actions effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the dream-analysis method stretches coherence slightly. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded island is vividly atmospheric, and sensory details (cool coffee, damp underbrush) deepen immersion. The setting enhances the story’s eerie tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink well, mirror) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous yet purposeful, with strong thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "boisterously quiet" feels forced. The dream motif and twist avoid cliché, and the prose avoids purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered tale that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering existential weight.</comment>
