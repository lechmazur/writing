<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Lira are well-defined with clear motivations, though Lira's depth could be expanded. Their shared love for old movies adds unique flavor but feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with strong cause-and-effect logic, though the "between sets" timeframe feels tangential. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details. Atmosphere and setting amplify tension and character motives flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cap as a badge, crystals as voices) and subtext elevate the narrative. Ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of necromancy and sci-fi avoids clich√©s. Minor stiffness in dialogue ("Next time, we bring popcorn") slightly undermines authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, inventive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
