<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's immortal weariness and futile restoration attempts are vividly portrayed, but his motivation could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cyclical structure mirrors the theme of lost history elegantly, though the acceleration garden’s role could be more tightly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting’s blend of futuristic decay and natural longing is masterfully atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., "faint hum of life") elevating immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (earbud as seed, ink as memory) and layered subtext. The brittle ending lingers with haunting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strikingly original voice and fresh metaphors ("time bent like saplings"). Minor risk of over-poetic abstraction in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The earbud’s symbolism and the keeper’s defiance echo beyond the page.</comment>
