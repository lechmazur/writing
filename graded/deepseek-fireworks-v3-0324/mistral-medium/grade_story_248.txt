<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sentinel's desperation and flawed interpretation of the prophecy create a compelling arc, though his "unsteady" nature could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tight, urgent pacing with a clear arc; the collision threat and prophecy unraveling merge seamlessly, though the final act feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric tension—rust, ozone, and dying stars heighten the dread. The setting feels integral to the narrative’s weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bird as guide/blade, prophecy as lie) and a haunting ending, but the "cheerless ecstasy" tone occasionally clashes with the prose’s solemnity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "ambush of fate" concept teeters on melodrama. Avoids clichés but leans hard on cosmic irony.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce powerfully; the bird and prophecy feel inevitable, not imposed. The brevity amplifies the impact.</comment>
