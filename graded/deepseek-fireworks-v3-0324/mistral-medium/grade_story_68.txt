<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lucius is compelling with clear moral conflict, though his hacker identity feels slightly underdeveloped in this setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the rake handle method feels abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers on the tension between truth and mercy.</comment>
