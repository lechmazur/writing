<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "rationally emotional" attribute isn't fully explored. His recklessness and transformation are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the synchronized watch alarms feel slightly forced as a method. The arc, however, is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vivid and enhances the mood, though the funhouse mirrors could be more deeply integrated into the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clover, torn map) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but a few phrases feel slightly generic (e.g., "ghostly echo"). The handling of "jubilant despair" is unique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with a lingering sense of unresolved possibility. The brief length feels deliberate and effective.</comment>
