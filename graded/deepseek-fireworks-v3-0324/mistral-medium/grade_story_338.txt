<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "zany" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking tangible quirks or depth beyond the premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt; the ending’s resolution is elegant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—sensory details and setting intertwine to create a haunting, immersive mood that elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and subtext, though the theme of "breaking stereotypes" is more implied than explored; the ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in perspective, but a few metaphors verge on cliché (e.g., "danced like memories"); prose avoids excess ornamentation but lacks stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, but some elements (e.g., "breaking stereotypes") feel incidental rather than integral to the narrative’s core.</comment>
