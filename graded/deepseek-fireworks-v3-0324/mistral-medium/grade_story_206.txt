<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's vendetta is vividly clear, and his precise creativity feels organic to his actions. However, his emotional depth could be explored further to avoid a one-dimensional feel.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the photographs and candy sculptures driving the narrative logically. The pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the betrayal's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The market's decaying atmosphere is masterfully immersive, with sensory details (scent, crumbling stalls) enhancing the rebellion's scars. A standout in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (sugar as art and weapon) and subtext (vengeance vs. sacrifice) are layered effectively. The ending is purposeful, though the prose occasionally tips into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "carved vengeance into candy") and a surprising twist elevate originality. Minor over-reliance on "ardent scorn" as emotional shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the hidden continent and rebellion serving the core theme of betrayal. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
