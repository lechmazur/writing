<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The exorcist's motivation is clear and compelling, blending science and wonder. His "inwardly social" nature adds depth, though his "coy aggression" could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with puzzles driving the narrative. The resolution is ambiguous but purposeful, and pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The facility’s sterile yet mystical atmosphere is richly evoked. Sensory details (dust, humming walls) enhance immersion, though dance lessons feel slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (postcard, device) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the "coy aggression" tone occasionally clashes with the introspective prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Some phrases ("guarded disclosures") feel slightly forced, but the emotional nuance and thematic depth are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story thematically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
