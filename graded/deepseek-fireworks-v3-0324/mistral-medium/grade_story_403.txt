<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and poetic, but some actions (e.g., secluding himself) could be more explicitly tied to his desperation for freedom.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The seashell's role as a catalyst is elegant, though the ending's fracture into "possibility" risks feeling abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World and atmosphere are stunningly rendered—sensory details and the library's paradoxical nature elevate the story. The setting feels inseparable from the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative and layered, with strong literary devices. The ending is satisfying, though the "joyful agony" refrain borders on overuse. Theme resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors. Minor quibbles: "joyful agony" repetition and a hint of over-poetic abstraction in the climax.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers. Only slight unevenness in balancing all elements holds it back from perfection.</comment>
