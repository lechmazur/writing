<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is vivid and her actions are consistently aligned with her desire to channel the star's wrath. Her "smiling saboteur" persona adds depth, though her internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from curiosity to climax. The mannequins' whispers and the explosion of light create a satisfying cause-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with decay mirroring Lena's soul. Sensory details (rusted beams, flickering light) immerse the reader. The gorge and tower amplify the story's stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., "constellation of cracks") and thematic depth elevate this. The ending lingers, blending beauty and destruction. Literary craft is near-flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though some phrases edge toward lyricism over precision. The star's wrath feels fresh, but mannequins risk clich√© if not for their eerie execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout in thematic and stylistic unity.</comment>
