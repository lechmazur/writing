<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and vivid, but his personality could be further nuanced to avoid leaning into archetype. His "hauntingly cheerful" demeanor is striking but borders on whimsy without deeper grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc despite brevity. The projector's hum as a method feels slightly contrived, but the cause-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and rich with sensory detail. The station's sterility versus the alchemist's magic creates a compelling contrast, though "between innings" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—evocative symbolism, layered themes, and a resonant ending. The cracked lens as a key to wonder is masterfully executed. Only minor quibble: the projector’s role could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "stars as brushstrokes"). Avoids clichés, though "hauntingly cheerful" risks becoming grating if overused. Emotional nuance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s heart. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering wonder. A standout piece with minimal flaws.</comment>
