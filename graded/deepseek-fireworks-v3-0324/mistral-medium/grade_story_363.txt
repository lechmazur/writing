<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's grief and indifference are well-integrated, but his "passionately indifferent" stance could be more sharply defined to avoid ambiguity. His actions with the bell are poignant and reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a quiet arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The bell's symbolism and Elias's mourning drive the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hall’s atmosphere is richly evoked, with the blueprints and silence amplifying Elias's grief. The parade float’s disappearance is a subtle but powerful contrast to the stillness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the bell, blueprints) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the "poignant levity" tone is understated to near-invisibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clichés. The bell’s silence and Elias's grief feel fresh, though some phrasing edges toward over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, but the "secret society" aspect slightly strains believability.</comment>
