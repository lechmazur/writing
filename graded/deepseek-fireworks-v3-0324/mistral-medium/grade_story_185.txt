<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's "infuriatingly calm" demeanor and preservation-driven motivation are clear and consistent. His actions with the pencil stub reveal depth, though his 'peculiar collector' trait could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the piano bench and pencil stub driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (resonance, crumbling pencil). The probability center and millennia-spanning timeframe enhance the story's grandeur and tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (pencil as buried talent) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the prose avoids telling—emotions are shown through actions and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "equations realigning into a symphony"). No clichés; the tone is consistent, and the handling of emotion is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, with creative use of the piano bench and pencil stub. The story lingers, suggesting depth beyond its brief length.</comment>
