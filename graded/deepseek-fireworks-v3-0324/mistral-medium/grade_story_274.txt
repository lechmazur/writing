<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sentient houseplant's motivation is clear and unique, though its apathetic devotion could be more deeply explored. Its actions align well with its curiosity for hidden knowledge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well within the word limit, but the drive-in's role feels slightly underdeveloped. The arc from discovery to escape is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (rain, rust, flickering screen). The abandoned drive-in enhances the story's eerie, introspective mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, typewriter) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the cat's reintroduction feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct voice. Emotion is shown through action and setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively. The story feels deliberate and leaves a lingering weight, though the drive-in's significance could be sharper.</comment>
