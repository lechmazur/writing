<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed with clear motivation, but his "socially awkward" trait feels underutilized beyond initial setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the whistle's mystery driving a satisfying arc, though the "reversed trails" concept is slightly opaque.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with diner and grove settings enriched by sensory details (neon hum, rain scent). The whistle's symbolism ties seamlessly to the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (whistle/tree), evocative prose, and a resonant theme of rebuilding. Dialogue is sharp, and the ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though "tree of regret" leans slightly tropey. Emotional beats feel earned, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The brevity serves the storyâ€™s poetic density, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
