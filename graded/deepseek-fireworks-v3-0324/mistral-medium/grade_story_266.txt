<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though some actions (like hurling the clock) feel slightly theatrical rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but relies heavily on symbolism, which occasionally overshadows cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, but the yoga studio feels underutilized. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
