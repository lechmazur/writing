<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in familial legacy, but the "ghost whisperer" aspect feels slightly underexplored for such a defining trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from stagnation to rebellion. Pacing is excellent, though the shooting gallery's role could be more thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with evocative sensory details. The abandoned carnival setting amplifies the melancholic rebellion perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber, letter) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the ghosts' approval slightly undercuts the defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but the "joyfully melancholic" tone occasionally tips into contrivance. Fresh metaphors, though the ghosts' murmurs border on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically sharp, with creative use of constraints. Leaves a lingering sense of liberation, though the letter's symbolic weight feels unresolved.</comment>
