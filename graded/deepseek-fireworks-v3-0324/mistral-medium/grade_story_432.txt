<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and compelling; "death wish" is subverted into a quest for truth, aligning with his actions. Distinct voice through introspective narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is taut and purposeful; ice sculpture's collapse as a metaphor ties beginning to end. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly immersive; subterranean waterfall and ice sculpture enhance the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (mist, cracking ice) are potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bookmark, poison) and layered theme of sacrifice for knowledge. Ending is hauntingly resonant. Prose is lyrical yet precise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés. Metaphors ("waterfall’s mist clung to his skin like a second soul") are fresh. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about cyclical seekers. Style elevates the narrative.</comment>
