<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, though her "gentle" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated. Her distinct voice emerges through the whispered fragments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the dwarves' sudden readiness to march feels slightly abrupt. Pacing excels within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully immersive, with sensory details (damp earth, shimmering glass) enhancing the eerie, subterranean mood. Setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly as truth, garden as justice) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying, though the thief’s introduction could be less abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the reversed messages and joyful terror tone, but "inscrutably obvious" feels forced. Metaphors (e.g., "brittle branch") are fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, leaving a lingering sense of rebirth. Length feels deliberate, with creative integration of assigned components.</comment>
