<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The scholar's reticence and mischievous grin are well-integrated, but his motivation to "dethrone complacency" feels slightly abstract without deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the knock serving as a catalyst, though the resolution (the pact and aria) edges toward abruptness in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—flooded opera house and flickering lanterns merge seamlessly with the echoes and scholar's isolation. Sensory details (cake scent, water lapping) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tablet as rebellion, drowned opera house as forgotten art) and subtext, but the stranger's introduction lacks enough friction to fully land the confrontation's weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The "gathering of echoes" trope is freshened by the opera house setting, though "pensive mirth" feels slightly strained in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the cake baking timeframe and sketches in the dictionary could be more organically pivotal to the climax.</comment>
