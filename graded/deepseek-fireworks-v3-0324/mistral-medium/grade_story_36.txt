<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' character is vividly portrayed with clear motivation and a distinct voice, though his "faithfully odd" attribute could be more explicitly developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the train whistle's role in driving the action feels slightly over-relied upon.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and dawn setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details that immerse the reader. The "placid ferocity" tone is slightly uneven in execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices and subtext elevate the storytelling, though the ending's emotional punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but some metaphors verge on overused (e.g., "ghosts of forgotten dreams"). The voice avoids clich√© but occasionally strains for profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering impact, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
