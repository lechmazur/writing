<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard's distraction and guilt are vividly portrayed, aligning with his motivation to seek redemption. His internal conflict and eventual resolution reveal depth, though his "almost radical" attribute could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hourglass and ribbon serving as cohesive metaphors. Pacing is excellent, and the ending resolves cleanly, though the "cosmic silence" motif slightly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen’s sensory details (heat, hissing steam) amplify the atmosphere brilliantly. The setting and timeframe ("apology waits unspoken") merge seamlessly, though "abrasive calm" occasionally feels overworked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ribbon as time, hourglass as memory) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s emotional payoff is profound, though the voice’s neutrality slightly dampens stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clichés. The "price of forgiveness" theme feels fresh, but some phrases ("cosmic silence") edge toward artifice. Metaphors are inventive but occasionally overextended.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious micro-story. Elements serve the narrative elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers emotionally, though the "infernal" setting’s extremity risks overshadowing subtler themes.</comment>
