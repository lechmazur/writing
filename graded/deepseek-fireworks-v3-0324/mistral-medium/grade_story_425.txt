<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The paladin's morose nature and layered motivation (duty vs. disillusionment) are compelling, though his "bored excitement" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, efficient arc with clear cause-and-effect; the needle's role as a key feels earned, though the blackout's connection to the flares could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the needle's transformation from dull to glowing is particularly inspired.</comment>
