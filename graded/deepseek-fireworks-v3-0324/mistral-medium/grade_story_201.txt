<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora's impulsivity and whimsy are vividly portrayed, driving her actions consistently. Her motivation to complete her grandmother’s composition is clear, though deeper exploration of her internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from problem to resolution. The waterfall’s revelation as the missing notes is a clever twist, though the leap to this realization could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and dusk atmosphere are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (moss, mist, roaring water) enhancing mood. The setting feels integral to the story’s emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s emotional resonance is strong, and the use of symbolism (stars, fortress humming) adds depth. The ending is satisfying, though the "golden light" resolution leans slightly toward cliché.</comment>
