<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chef's muted voice and reliance on flavors for communication are unique and well-integrated, but the child's attachment to the music box lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the Cradle of Hope serving as a clear focal point. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the street fair introduction feels slightly rushed.</comment>
