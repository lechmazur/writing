<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's dismay and motivation are clear, but his depth feels slightly overshadowed by the dense atmosphere. His actions align with his quest, but his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently, with the Polaroids and watch band driving the narrative. The arc feels complete, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sky-lounge and endless city are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (watch band) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and symbolism elevate the prose, though some imagery borders on overworked. The ending is purposeful, but the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original atmosphere and fresh metaphors, but occasional verbosity ("neon whispers tangled with garden secrets") hints at AI's tendency toward excess. Nuance in emotion is strong but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the density of imagery occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>
