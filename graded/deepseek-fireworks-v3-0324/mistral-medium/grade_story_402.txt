<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The baron's solitude and connection to the land are compelling, but his "baron" title feels underdeveloped and oddly aristocratic for a survivalist. His motivation to archive is clear, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive but slightly rushed; the raft's sudden presence detracts from the orchard's tension. The bottle's significance resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is hauntingly vivid, with roots and bones enriching the atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "gnarled fingers," "luminous doubt") excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong literary craft, but the ending's optimism clashes with the "luminous doubt" tone. Symbolism (bottle as archive) is potent yet slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "baron" and "sign language" feel contrived. Prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally drifts into over-poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the raft/bottle climax feels abrupt. The story lingers intellectually, though emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>
