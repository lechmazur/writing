<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character voice and motivation, though the outlaw cowboy poet archetype leans slightly toward genre cliché. Actions align with his poetic, fate-twisting nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional coherence and pacing for the word limit. The dice, walls, and reunion form a tight cause-effect chain. Ending resolves while leaving room for ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory and shifting text walls are vividly rendered. Sensory details (oil, paper, clinking spurs) deepen the ambivalent tone. World feels integral, not decorative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful subtext—fate vs. agency, unspoken words. Symbolism (dice, gears) enhances themes. Ending resonates emotionally without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of genres (western/steampunk/magical realism). Minor AI-like phrasing in "virtually peculiar," but metaphors (e.g., "walls shifted text like restless spirits") feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Length feels deliberate, ending lingers. Cohesive despite complexity—proof of inventive execution.</comment>
