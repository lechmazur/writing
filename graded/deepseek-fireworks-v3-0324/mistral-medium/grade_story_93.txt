<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias' motivation and crisis are clear, but his "labyrinth architect" role feels slightly underdeveloped, more metaphorical than concrete.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from despair to tentative resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—elevator claustrophobia, radio static, and vintage cards merge into a haunting, immersive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (geometry, labyrinths) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("desperate hope") verge on cliché. Nuanced emotion avoids AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly; the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering, poetic resonance.</comment>
