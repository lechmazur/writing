<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The traveler's transformation from aimless to purposeful is compelling, though his "factually imaginative" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly from discovery to resolution, with hopscotch as an ingenious narrative device. Minor pacing lags in archival dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm: every element serves the core theme of cultural preservation with poetic efficiency.</comment>
