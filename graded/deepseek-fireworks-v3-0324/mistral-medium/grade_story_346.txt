<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s transformation from boastful to introspective is compelling, but his initial bravado could be more sharply defined. The lint as a fading talisman is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s surreal logic holds, with clear cause-effect relationships. Pacing is tight, though the queen’s appearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The nest’s sensory details (stench, pulsing walls) are masterful, creating a claustrophobic, hallucinatory atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lint, silk veil) and layered themes (illusion vs. clarity) resonate. The ending’s emotional payoff is strong, though some metaphors verge on overdone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("precise madness") and subverted tropes (boastful warrior unraveling) stand out. Minor gripes: "rewired" feels overused, and some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity serves the story’s intensity, though the queen’s dialogue could be more integrated.</comment>
