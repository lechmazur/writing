<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The deputy's inner conflict and quiet revelation are subtly but effectively rendered, though his impassivity occasionally flattens emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's minimalism is deftly handled, with the twist tie's unraveling serving as a cohesive metaphor for the deputy's arc. Pacing is impeccable for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral and orchard merge into a haunting, evocative setting. Sensory details (overripe fruit, damp stone) amplify the atmosphere masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and restrained prose create lingering impact. The ending's ambiguity feels purposeful, though the bees' role edges toward mysticism without full clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "grace" motif risks leaning into vague spiritualism. The twist tie's symbolism is refreshingly unconventional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for resonance.</comment>
