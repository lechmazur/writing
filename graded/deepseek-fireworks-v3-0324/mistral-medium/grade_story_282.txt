<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blacksmith's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "brashness" could be more vividly shown. His distinct voice and actions align with his desire to preserve tradition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the medal and shell serving as clever catalysts. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (dust, old wood) enhancing the mystical tone. The discount store becomes a surprising yet fitting stage.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (shell, dust) and subtext about memory. The ending lingers, and the prose is evocative without being florid.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of magic realism and nostalgia feels unique, though the "dusty exuberance" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply resonant. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the length feels deliberate. A standout piece.</comment>
