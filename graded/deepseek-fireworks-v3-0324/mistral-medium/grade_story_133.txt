<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and consistent, with his jaded nature contrasting well with his duty to preserve. His reaction to the throne and his use of the gloves reveal depth, though his dialogue could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The throne's shadow looms effectively, but the pottery class encounter feels abrupt. The ending resolves cleanly, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (blossoms, paint) enhancing the mood. The labyrinth orchard and rooftops complement the themes of secrecy and choice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gloves, keyhole) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the stranger's dialogue leans slightly melodramatic. The theme of preservation resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("delightfully menacing") flirt with clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, and the gloves' symbolism feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. The story lingers, though the throne's allure could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>
