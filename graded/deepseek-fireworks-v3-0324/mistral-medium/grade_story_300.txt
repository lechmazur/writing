<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassius is vividly portrayed with clear motivation—his determination and pragmatic hope drive the narrative. His actions align well with his outlaw persona and wistful pragmatism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to action. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect chain (canvas → archway) feels logical and urgent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Roman marketplace is richly evoked through sensory details (olives, sweat, chaos). Atmosphere enhances Cassius's urgency and the story’s tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shard, smudges) and subtext (outlaw-to-legend transformation). Ending is purposeful, though the theme of power could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but "shimmer of possibility" feels slightly overused. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though mockery-to-awe shift could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a tantalizing question about consequences. Creative and memorable.</comment>
