<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his internal conflict could be deeper. His detachment is well-conveyed, though his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The journal swap is a strong device, but the transition to his transcendence could be smoother.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional—evocative and immersive. The underground setting and dying star’s resonance are hauntingly effective.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and atmospheric prose, though the ending's emotional impact could be sharper. The theme of narrative mastery is compelling.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but some phrasing feels overly polished. The concept of digitized burdens is fresh, though execution leans slightly abstract.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the climax feels abrupt. The length suits the story, though a touch more development would elevate it.</comment>
