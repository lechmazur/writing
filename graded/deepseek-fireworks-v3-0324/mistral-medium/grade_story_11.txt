<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation and internal conflict are vividly portrayed, with a clear arc from constraint to rebellion, though his "flighty" nature could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a resonant arc; "linearizing chaos" drives the narrative effectively, though the initiation hall's rituals feel slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—candlelit secrecy contrasts beautifully with the cartographer’s yearning for open skies. Sensory details (grease-stained patch, murmuring elders) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story’s craftsmanship shines: symbolism (paintings as maps), subtext (rebellion vs. conformity), and a satisfying ending. Minimal dialogue but potent when used.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality is strong—avoids clichés but occasionally leans on familiar "secret society" tropes. Emotional nuance (serene anger, quiet triumph) feels human and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich; the word limit feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about freedom vs. tradition. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
