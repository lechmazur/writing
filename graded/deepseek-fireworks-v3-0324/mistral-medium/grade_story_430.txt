<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaver's internal conflict and transformation are vividly portrayed, with his closed-off nature and hunger for redemption clearly driving his actions. His "voice" is distinct, though slightly more introspection could deepen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the child's drawing and poems driving the reaver toward catharsis. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete, though the transition to surrender could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The park's fractured light and grotesque beauty mirror the reaver's psyche flawlessly. Sensory details (ink, laughter, colors) immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies the theme of fractured identity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars, ink, scars) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the prose balances lyrical precision with emotional resonance. Minor dialogue absence is negligible.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "stars tasted like ink"). Avoids clich√©s, and the grotesque/mocking tone feels deliberate. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, with only rare over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically into a cohesive whole. The brevity serves the story's intensity, and the theme lingers. A standout example of constrained storytelling with depth.</comment>
