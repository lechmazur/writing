<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot's structure is coherent but leans heavily on abstraction, making some transitions feel abrupt. The ending resolves poetically but lacks concrete closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the story's brevity exposes gaps in logic. The wristband and quilt motifs linger, though the greenhouse feels underutilized.</comment>
