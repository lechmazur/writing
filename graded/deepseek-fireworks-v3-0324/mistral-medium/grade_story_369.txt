<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but "optimistically bitter" could be more deeply explored. His voice is distinct and his actions reveal psychological depth.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. Pacing is strong, though the resolution leans slightly on abstraction. Cause and effect are well-handled.</comment>
