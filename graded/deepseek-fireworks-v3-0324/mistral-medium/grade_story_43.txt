<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's "loudly introverted" nature is subtly conveyed through his actions and reactions, but the motivation to find "emblems of courage" feels slightly abstract. His arc is clear, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled and purposeful, with the CD and fireflies driving the narrative forward. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and fog create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (fractured light, humming silence) are masterfully deployed to elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (CD as fragmented anthem, candle as fist) and lyrical prose heighten the emotional impact. The theme of courage vs. fear is resonant and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (fireflies as "crooked hope"). Minimal clich√©, though "neon cathedral" borders on overused cyberpunk tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the CD and setting serving the theme perfectly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
