<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "mirthful solemnity" could be more deeply explored to fully distinguish his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the stranger's abrupt vanishing feels slightly contrived within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (herbs, light) enhancing the mood. The setting and object are seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herbs as keys) and a resonant ending, though some thematic layers could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The herbs' symbolism and Elias's role feel inventive, though the "last truth" concept edges close to familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The brevity serves the story, though the stranger's role could be tightened further.</comment>
