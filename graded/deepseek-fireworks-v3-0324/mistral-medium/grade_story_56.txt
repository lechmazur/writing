<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with a clear blend of charm and deceit, though his "energetically lethargic" trait feels slightly underutilized. His motivation to reveal a truth is compelling and drives the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from bluff to confession. The dropped book and meet-cute device works, though the orchard theft revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard setting is richly evocative, blending decay and renewal. Sensory details (rust, apples, vines) deepen the atmosphere, though the computer's role is less integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (price tag, vines) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the woman's role edges on cryptic. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "invisible allies" as past lies). Avoids clichés, though the "gentle harshness" tone occasionally wavers. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the skyscraper setting’s logic could be tighter.</comment>
