<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation and transformation are clear, but his initial "unconvinced" state feels underdeveloped. His obsession with the fork and piano echoes is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the resolution (faith "transformed") is slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass desert and monarch butterfly create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crunching shards, humming air) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork, butterfly) and a layered theme of seeking elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the piano cipher subplot feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("capriciously consistent," "discordant notes held a cipher") verge on overworked. Avoids clich√©s, though the "tested faith" arc is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, stylistically assured piece with lingering depth. The elements serve the story, though the piano echoes could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
