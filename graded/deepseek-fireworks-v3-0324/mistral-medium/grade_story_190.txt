<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The smuggler's cautious yet impulsive nature is compelling, though his shift toward empathy feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between predicting storms and empathy feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center and butterfly create a vivid, atmospheric contrast. Sensory details (brittle wings, hum of machines) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, though the ending’s emotional payoff could be sharper. Literary devices are used with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its metaphors (butterfly as control, storm as empathy). Avoids clichés, though "enthusiastic apathy" toes the line of contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about empathy’s uncontrollable nature.</comment>
