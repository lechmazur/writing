<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The self-taught wizard's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "voice" could be more distinct to elevate his characterization further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven with a satisfying arc, though the pacing nears abruptness in the climax. The cosmic disclaimers could integrate more seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly realized, with glitches and auroras creating a mesmerizing atmosphere. Sensory details (like the bear's weight) are masterfully used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (teddy bear as vessel, auroras as gateways) and poetic prose elevate it, though the alien frequencies occasionally disrupt immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "daring compassion" theme slightly strains believability. The ethereal wizard and heavy bear are fresh, non-clich√©d choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels intentional and cohesive, with the auroras lingering as a haunting metaphor. The word limit is used deftly, not as a constraint.</comment>
