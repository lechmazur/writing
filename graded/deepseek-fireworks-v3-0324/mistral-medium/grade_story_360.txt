<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The necromancer's meekness and sincerity are well-developed, and his motivation to decode the riddle is clear and consistent. His actions, such as tracing the tapestry and using dew drops, align with his introspective nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dew-drop method driving the resolution logically. The story achieves a clear, satisfying arc within the word limit, moving from confusion to epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city and playground sounds create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (ink seeping, dew reflections) immerse the reader and enhance the mystic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tapestry, dew) and a reflective ending elevate the story. The theme of surrendering to the unknown is subtly but powerfully conveyed through imagery and character growth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The dew-as-riddle metaphor and the necromancer's quiet revelation feel uniquely human, not algorithmic. Language is evocative without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful short story. The elements serve the narrative, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
