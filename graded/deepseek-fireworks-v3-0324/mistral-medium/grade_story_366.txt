<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's telepathy adds depth, but her "efficiently inefficient" trait feels underdeveloped. Her motivation and actions align well with her pursuit of decoding, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The frost-message twist is elegantly executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dock’s industrial grit contrasts beautifully with the delicate frost motifs, creating a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (button hook, ice patterns) and subtext. The ending resonates, though the foreman’s role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the button hook and frost patterns particularly standout. The length feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
