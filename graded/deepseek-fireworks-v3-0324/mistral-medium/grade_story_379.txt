<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His "impatiently patient" nature drives coherent actions, though the lawyer angle feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent pacing with a clear arc. The dares and riddles propel the plot organically, though the rivals' presence lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The biodome setting is immersive and richly detailed, enhancing tension and theme. Sensory language (e.g., "scent of soil and ozone") elevates atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (gift tag, languages) and subtext. Ending is poignant and layered, with lyrical prose amplifying impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clichés, though the "trickster lawyer" trope isn’t fully subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting thematic aftertaste.</comment>
