<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's background as a game show host adds depth to his fall and isolation, but his motivation to "rescue sacred knowledge" feels slightly underdeveloped in relation to his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect relationships, though the "typewriter’s silence" feels minimally integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion; the jungle's "insect symphony" and bioluminescent cavern create a vivid, haunting setting that enhances the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in subtext, symbolism, and emotional resonance, though the woman’s "bitter honey" dialogue could be refined for sharper impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and a surprising twist. Only minor AI-like phrasing ("gentle overturn" is slightly overused).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively, leaving a lingering philosophical weight. The brevity feels deliberate and powerful.</comment>
