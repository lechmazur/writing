<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and consistent, with his analytical mind and sobriety shaping his actions. His distinct voice and reaction to the ink well reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ink well's glow and the coffee's cooling serving as logical triggers. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The island's misty atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (whispering voices, grasping branches) enhancing the eerie mood. The setting deeply supports the story's concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as living shadow, the crumbling ink well) and a haunting ending elevate this. The theme of crossing boundaries is explored with subtlety and impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the nature of reality and dreams.</comment>
