<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theo's quiet deserter persona is compelling and consistent, with his puzzle-solving and mask-reconstruction revealing depth. His motivation to break the cycle of running is clear, though his transition to plant communion could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Theo's actions driving the narrative toward a satisfying, surreal resolution. The word limit is used effectively, though the climax's electrical anomaly feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plant communication lab is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cracked mirror, kiln heat) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements Theo's arc and the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (masks, puzzles) and subtext (belonging, communication). The ending is hauntingly resonant, and the prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of botany, desertion, and ritual artifacts feels fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, and the style is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
