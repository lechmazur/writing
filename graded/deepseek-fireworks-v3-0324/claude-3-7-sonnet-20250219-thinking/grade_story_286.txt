<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's character is vividly drawn, with her professional apologizer background and reserved nature deeply influencing her actions and worldview. Her motivation to map seasonal changes is clear and consistent, though her "wildly reserved" attribute could be more explicitly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced within the word limit, with a clear arc from Maya's daily routine to her nocturnal research. The connection between the Dissolution and her work is intriguing but could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nanobotanical garden and post-law world are richly imagined, with sensory details (the vinyl shard, pulsing Hydrangea Pixels) enhancing immersion. The atmosphere perfectly supports Maya's introspective work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (vinyl record, napkins) and subtext to explore authenticity and human fragility. The ending is satisfying, though the central conflict (Maya vs. societal collapse) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "Quantum Willows") and nuanced emotion. The narrative avoids clich√©s and AI-generated pitfalls, though the "elated fatigue" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about humanity's remnants. Minor tightening of Maya's reserved nature would elevate it further.</comment>
