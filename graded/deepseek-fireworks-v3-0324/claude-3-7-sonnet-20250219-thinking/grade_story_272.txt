<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's socially awkward nature and inventor background are well-integrated, driving his actions and interactions. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his "hopefully cynical" stance could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (whistle's use) could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner and encrypted archive create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (buzzing lights, murmuring crowd) enhance the mood, and the setting supports the story's tension perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle, tree of regret) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant. Dialogue is natural, and the style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes. The wooden whistle as a decryption tool is particularly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with creative integration of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
