<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, but his transformation into a conduit feels slightly abrupt. His rebellious nature and secret tattoos add depth, but his final realization could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Marcus's mundane duties to his cosmic revelation. The laundromat scene is a strong pivot, though the transition to his final transformation could be smoother.</comment>
