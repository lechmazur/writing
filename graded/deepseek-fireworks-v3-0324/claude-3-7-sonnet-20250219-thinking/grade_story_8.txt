<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Ellison's motivation is clear and compelling, blending aristocratic duty with rebellious creativity. His "dazed" demeanor contrasts effectively with his precise actions, though his internal conflict could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from ritual to vindication. The tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution, but the cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (chalk dust, humming sculptures) enhancing the mystical atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of music as a bridge between worlds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (chalk as rebellion, music as divine language) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the "benign ferocity" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "music must breathe beyond the staff"). Nuanced emotion and stylistic flair distinguish it from formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the chalk and garden serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on art’s transcendent potential.</comment>
