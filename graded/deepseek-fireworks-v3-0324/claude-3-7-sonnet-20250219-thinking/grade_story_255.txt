<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and compelling, blending mystical insight with analytical rigor. Her distinct voice and actions align well with her traits, though her "nondescript" nature could be more vividly portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and petrichor are masterfully used to create atmosphere. Sensory details (rain, dust, confetti) immerse the reader and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the USB as a "mythic relic") and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The seer's hybrid method and the USB's symbolism demonstrate ingenuity. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering thought about truth's power. Feels complete despite brevity.</comment>
