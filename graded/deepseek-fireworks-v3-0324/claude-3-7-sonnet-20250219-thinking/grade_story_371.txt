<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vex's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her backstory, with her actions consistently aligned. Her "fervent apathy" is a compelling contradiction that defines her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The word limit is well-managed, though the climax could benefit from slightly more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (neon, rain, synthetic incense) that enhance atmosphere and character motivation. The storm's aftermath adds temporal texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hatpin, marbles) and subtext (shelter as defiance). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, with dialogue that feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The marbles-as-code twist is inventive, and Vex's emotional nuance avoids AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about resilience in dystopia.</comment>
