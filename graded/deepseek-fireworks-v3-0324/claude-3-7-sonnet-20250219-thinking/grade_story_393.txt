<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emmett's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the plot with emotional weight. His alchemical background and familial ties are well-integrated, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The alignment of celestial and biological timing is clever, though the chain-reactive coincidences verge on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, blending mundane suburban life with eerie alchemical mystery. Sensory details (tar pit, chrysalis) enhance the otherworldly tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coin, butterfly) and layered themes (inheritance, transformation). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The alchemical premise feels authentic, though the "chain-reactive coincidences" device slightly undermines the story's grounded nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful narrative where elements serve the story elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impression.</comment>
