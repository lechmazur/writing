<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness and emotional detachment are well-developed and consistent, revealing depth through her interaction with the stones and the anomaly. Her shift from armor to vulnerability is subtly but effectively portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the gravitational anomaly and stones driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is a brilliant, evocative setting that enhances both mood and theme. Sensory details (whispers in the stone, floating tools) immerse the reader without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stones as planets, gravity as emotional weight) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The gravitational anomaly and stones feel fresh, and Elara's emotional arc is nuanced rather than stated. Language is precise yet evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
