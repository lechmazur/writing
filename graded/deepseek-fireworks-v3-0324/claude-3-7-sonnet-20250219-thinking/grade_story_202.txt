<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's dual life as a poisoner and authenticator is compelling, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her "innocently guilty" demeanor adds depth, though her moral code could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the scavenger hunt and poison delivery logically interwoven. Pacing is excellent, and the ending delivers a satisfying resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum and skateboarding festival create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "dusty starlight") enhance immersion, and the setting actively supports the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (justice vs. law) and literary devices (symbolism of the rapier) elevate the story. The ending lingers, and the prose is polished without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., skateboarding as defiance). Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes; emotions are shown, not stated. Distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, and the story leaves a thematic aftertaste. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
