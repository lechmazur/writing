<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with her obsession and emotional stakes well-conveyed. Her "singularly plural" existence adds complexity, though this could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The DNA-to-animation method is inventive, and the pacing balances urgency with atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk underworld and neon orchard are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., "recycled air tasted of silicon") immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the bell as legacy and redemption) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly resonant, blending emotional and thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The DNA-as-code concept feels fresh, and the prose is precise without being overly ornate. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Every element serves the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering existential question about consciousness.</comment>
