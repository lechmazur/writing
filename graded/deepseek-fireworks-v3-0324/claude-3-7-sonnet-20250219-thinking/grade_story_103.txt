<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thornfeld's transformation from prisoner to redeemed knight is deeply nuanced, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His reflection in the brass knocker is a brilliant touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the girl's cryptic gifts driving the revelation. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's oppressive yet hopeful atmosphere. Sensory details (cool metal, salted fish) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the patterned items as royal seal/map) and emotional depth elevate this beyond a simple redemption tale. The ending is profoundly satisfying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful short story. Every element serves the narrative, and the brevity amplifies its impact. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
