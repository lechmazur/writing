<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lantern's flicker and the trunk's pages creating urgency and coherence. The arc from detachment to enlightenment is satisfying, though the transition could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo and twilight atmosphere are masterfully evoked, enhancing the story's ethereal tone. Sensory details like the cherry petals and luminescent stone deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candle, lantern, decay) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of cosmic cycles is explored with depth, and the ending resonates. Minor tightening of metaphors could perfect it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The morbid florist premise and cosmic musings feel fresh. Some phrases verge on overly poetic but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. Elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering meditation on mortality.</comment>
