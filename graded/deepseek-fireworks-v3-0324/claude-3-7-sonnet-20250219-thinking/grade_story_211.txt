<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alastair's motivation is clear and consistent, with his gambler's luck and defiance of hopelessness driving his actions. His distinct voice and personality shine through, though deeper introspection could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The spin-the-bottle method is inventive, though its execution slightly strains believability. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the abandoned schoolhouse and poisoned atmosphere enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, rusted filing cabinet) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and thematic depth, blending hope and despair masterfully. Literary devices (e.g., "gravity of hopelessness") are used effectively, and the ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and a unique premise. The tone avoids clich√©s, though the gambler trope is slightly familiar. Nuanced handling of emotion and subtext stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the spin-the-bottle device slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>
