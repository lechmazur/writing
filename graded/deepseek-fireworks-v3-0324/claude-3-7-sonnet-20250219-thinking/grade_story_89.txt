<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ravik's zealotry and warrior background are well-integrated, but his internal conflict ("confusing certainty") could be more deeply explored to elevate his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the time capsules' activation could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cosmic setting and atmospheric details (e.g., "pulsing crimson light") are vividly rendered and reinforce the story's themes. The nail's warmth in freezing conditions is a standout sensory contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism ("Matter is memory"), layered subtext, and a hauntingly purposeful ending. The prose is polished, with minimal exposition and strong showing-over-telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "truth spreading like starlight"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "silent revolution" trope is slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking narrative where every element serves the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
