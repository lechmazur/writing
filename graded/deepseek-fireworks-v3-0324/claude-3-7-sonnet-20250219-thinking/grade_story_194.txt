<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The time-displacement twist is handled deftly, and the pacing balances urgency with atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is brilliantly evocative, enhancing the story's eerie tone. Sensory details (e.g., the "wrong" paper, bone arrangements) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered themes (destruction/healing, fate/agency). The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, and literary devices (e.g., prophetic nightmares) deepen the narrative.</comment>
