<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dana's manipulative curiosity is well-established, but her transition to earnest seeker feels abrupt. The professor's reaction is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot hinges on cryptic revelations, which are intriguing but rushed. The skates' introduction is abrupt, and the mythos lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper is striking but underutilized. Hospital atmosphere is generic; the "lucid confusion" tone clashes with clinical setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (skates, footprints) is inventive but overexplained. Ending hints at depth but lacks emotional resonance. Dialogue is functional but stiff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "scattered seeds"). Avoids clich√©s but leans on archetypes (meddler, wise professor). Some AI-like abruptness in transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements feel assembled rather than organic. Skyscraper/hospital mismatch undermines cohesion. Strong concept, uneven execution.</comment>
