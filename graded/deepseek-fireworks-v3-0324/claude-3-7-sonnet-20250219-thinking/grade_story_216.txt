<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's motivation is clear and consistent, with his obsession for decoding the washer revealing depth. His "voice" is distinct, though his emotional range could be broader.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the washer's mystery driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Archivists' role could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cloud City's setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (e.g., "cirrus wisps") enhancing the tone. The washer's connection to the setting is subtle but meaningful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (washer as identity) and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of redemption is layered, though the climax's emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The washer's symbolism is inventive, though the "obsessive calm" tone occasionally flattens tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. Leaves a lingering question about identity and sacrifice.</comment>
