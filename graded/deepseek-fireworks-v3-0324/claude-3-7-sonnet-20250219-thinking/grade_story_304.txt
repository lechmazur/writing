<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's motivation is clear and consistent, with a distinct voice and well-aligned actions, though their "superficially profound" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the spider's web metaphor feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere, though "borrowed starlight" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices and subtext, with a purposeful ending and evocative style. Minor quibble: the spider's web method slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though the "unforgiving road" concept borders on clich√©. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering sense of contradiction and dawn's promise.</comment>
