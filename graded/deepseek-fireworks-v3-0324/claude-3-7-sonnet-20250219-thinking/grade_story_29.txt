<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His cleverly naive approach adds depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard garden and Machine are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The streetlamp's modernity is a subtle but effective contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (jigsaw piece, Machine) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "mathematics of pure emotion" metaphor slightly overreaches.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The jigsaw edge and syncing method are inventive, though the "agonizing bliss" tone occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
