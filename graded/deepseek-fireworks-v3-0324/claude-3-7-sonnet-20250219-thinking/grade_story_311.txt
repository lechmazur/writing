<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dex's motivation is clear and consistent, with his stubborn nature and desire for freedom driving his actions. His "divine obstinance" and collected fragments of overheard stories reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each park visit building tension toward the rebellion. Cause-and-effect is logical, and the pacing balances urgency with subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered, with sensory details (artificial waterfalls, lush vegetation) enhancing the contrast between control and sanctuary. The setting amplifies the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (e.g., the photograph as a tether, "serene anger") and layered symbolism (plants breaking free) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>
