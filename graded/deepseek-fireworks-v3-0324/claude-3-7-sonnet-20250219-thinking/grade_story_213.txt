<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, with her grandmother's influence and scientific obsession driving her actions. Her "dutiful sentinel" role is well-integrated, though her "primal" reaction could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the wedding's power overload and prototype crisis creating logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's eerie blue glow and wedding's celebratory chaos contrast brilliantly, enhancing tension. Sensory details (champagne laughter, humming machine) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hair clip as key, artificial sunrise) and layered themes (destruction/creation, persistence) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("sunrise in miniature"). Minor AI-like phrasing ("delightfully strange" repetition), but emotional nuance and style feel distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingers on the tension between scientific rigor and primal inspiration.</comment>
