<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending curiosity, regret, and a desire for connection. His actions align well with his "unknowing heir" status, and his reactions to the spoon and mural reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spoon's magnetism and the mural's revelation driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned movie house and Magnetic Mountain create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (projector's drone, peeling paint) immerse the reader, and the setting enhances the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spoon, mural) and layered themes (inheritance, chaos) elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly open-ended, and the prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "frolicsome regret" tone is distinctive, and the handling of emotion is subtle yet resonant. No AI-generated flatness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful blend of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind. Every detail serves the narrative and themes.</comment>
