<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marielle's motivation is clear and consistent, with her cartographer skills and quiet rage driving her actions. Her brief moment of unity adds depth but feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from infiltration to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "flicker of unity" could be better integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The initiation hall setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (marble, candlelight) enhancing the atmosphere. The paintings' hidden details are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (paintings as maps) and subtext (truth vs. belonging). The ending is purposeful and resonant, though the "flicker of unity" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cartographer-as-spy premise is inventive, though the "serene anger" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers after reading.</comment>
