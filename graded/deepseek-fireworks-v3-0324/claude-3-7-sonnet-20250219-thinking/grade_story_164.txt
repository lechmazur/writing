<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oren's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his background as a blacksmith turned arcade technician. His "wistful" nature and "drifting arrogance" add layers to his character, making his actions feel authentic and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Oren's 17-minute window and rooftop planting creating a clear arc. The cause-and-effect logic (dust patterns → seed placement) is compelling and well-paced within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is vividly rendered, with the skylight and dust motes serving as potent symbols. Neon reflections and toxic atmosphere contrast beautifully with Oren's botanical rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (dust as "nature's blueprint") and subtext (revolution through memory). The ending is resonant, leaving the reader with a sense of quiet defiance and possibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés by grounding cyberpunk tropes in botanical revival. The prose is precise yet evocative, with fresh metaphors ("information was his metal").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with provocative weight.</comment>
