<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past actions, but her "lovingly hateful" passion could be more vividly explored to fully justify her penitence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain, though the ritual's mechanics could be slightly more grounded in the world's logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vault and twilight setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, suspended mood. The fruit preservation metaphor is particularly striking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that feels complete despite its brevity. The elements serve the storyâ€™s depth rather than constrain it.</comment>
