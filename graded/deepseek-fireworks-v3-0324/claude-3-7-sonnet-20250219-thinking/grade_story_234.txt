<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hiroshi's late-bloomer swordsmanship and xenophile yearning are compellingly integrated, though his "faithfully unfaithful" duality could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s cosmic ritual and museum setting cohere beautifully, but the orchard dog’s timing feels slightly contrived as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dinosaur skeleton museum and nocturnal atmosphere are vividly immersive, with the sundial’s mystery enhancing the otherworldly tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (matchbox, sundial) and subtext (marital tension vs. cosmic longing). The ending lingers with quiet profundity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("cradled the universe") and nuanced emotion elevate this beyond tropes. Only minor stiffness in the curator’s dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with the matchbox and sundial serving the theme of hidden infinities. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
