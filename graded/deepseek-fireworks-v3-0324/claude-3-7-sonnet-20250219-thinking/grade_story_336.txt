<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Masood's weariness and ancestral burden are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "imprison grief" could be more deeply explored to align with his undertaker role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the clock's mechanics and the billionaire's grief driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The reimagined Persian palace and the clock create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (alabaster walls, sun paths) elevate the setting's symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (e.g., "time suspend itself like dust motes") and layered themes (grief vs. preservation) make the story resonant. The ending lingers with purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, though the "placid ferocity" tone occasionally wavers. Metaphors are fresh, but some phrasing edges toward ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the storyâ€™s depth. Leaves a haunting question about time and sorrow.</comment>
