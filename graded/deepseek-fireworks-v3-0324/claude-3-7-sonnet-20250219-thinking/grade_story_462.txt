<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mason's motivation is clear and deeply woven into the narrative, with his actions and reactions revealing a nuanced, wounded psyche. His "voice" is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could deepen his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the abandoned carnival serving as a perfect catalyst for Mason's emotional arc. Pacing is excellent, though the transition from despair to hope could be slightly more gradual.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted—sensory details (dust, light, sound) immerse the reader. The carnival setting and stained glass panel are evocatively connected to Mason's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirrors, sparks) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant and purposeful, though Eliza's reintroduction could feel less abrupt with a hint earlier.</comment>
