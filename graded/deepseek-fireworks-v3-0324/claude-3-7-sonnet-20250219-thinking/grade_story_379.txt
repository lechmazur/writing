<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and consistent, blending her legal background with fugitive desperation. Her "trickster instincts" add depth, though her "impatiently patient" nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lark's dare, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the stakes of the diversion. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the trap's implications could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is richly evoked with sensory details (artificial dawn, nutrient-rich soil) that amplify the story's tension. The futuristic farm enhances Mira's isolation and purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gift tag, server farm) and subtext about preservation vs. corporate greed. The ending resonates, though the "ghostly resolve" tone occasionally overpowers nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "luminescent prison"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "cryptic dare" device leans slightly toward predictable resistance tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the biodome and languages theme standing out. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on lost truths.</comment>
