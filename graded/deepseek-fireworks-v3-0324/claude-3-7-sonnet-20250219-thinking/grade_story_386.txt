<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her identity as a time refugee. Her actions and dialogue consistently reflect her longing for her lost empire, and her distinct voice shines through.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The catapult action drives the narrative forward logically, and the pacing is well-managed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and borrowed dawn create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hum of the atom core, embroidered tablecloth) enrich the world and enhance Nara's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (tablecloth as memory), evocative imagery, and subtext (temporal anchors as hope). The ending is satisfying yet leaves room for reflection.</comment>
