<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elio's motivation is clear and consistent, with his yearning for transformation subtly revealed through his interactions with the ladle and meteorite. His "openly private" existence adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ladle's discovery and Elio's transformation forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, balancing introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The giant's dining room is vividly rendered, with sensory details (steam, trembling floor) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Elio's smallness and longing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ladle as vessel, meteorite as catalyst) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, tying theme and character growth together.</comment>
