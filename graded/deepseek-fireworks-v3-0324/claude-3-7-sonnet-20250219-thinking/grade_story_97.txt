<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Oracle's transformation from logic-driven to emotionally resonant is compelling, though her initial "desperately casual" demeanor could be more vividly contrasted with her later vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the dimensional instability and visions driving the Oracle's growth. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly rendered, with sensory details ("rippled like disturbed water") enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and tone merge seamlessly to amplify the Oracle's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (compass as emotional guide) and subtext. The ending is both satisfying and thematically rich, though the emotional flood of visions could be more staggered for impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("territories of vulnerability") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "optimistic desperation" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels expansive despite brevity. Leaves a lingering meditation on empathy vs. logic, though the "whispered minute" framing could be more integral.</comment>
