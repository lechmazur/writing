<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Thomas Reeves is well-developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His trembling hands and analytical nature reveal depth, though his "inwardly social" trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with puzzles driving the narrative logically toward a satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the dance lesson cover feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The research facility and eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (electrodes, spectral light) enhancing immersion. The postcard's connection to the setting is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, blending symbolism (postcard as key), subtext (science vs. faith), and a resonant ending. Dialogue is purposeful, and the theme of bridging worlds is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of quantum theory and exorcism is inventive, though "coy aggression" occasionally feels forced in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about consciousness and the divine.</comment>
