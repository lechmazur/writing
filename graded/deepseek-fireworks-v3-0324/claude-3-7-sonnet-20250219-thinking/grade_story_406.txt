<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and nuanced, with the spy's internal conflict and evolving relationship with the witch adding depth. His "coy" nature is subtly shown through actions like the button catch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the loose button and potion hunt driving momentum. The resolution feels earned, though the time-reversal method slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brewery setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's magical realism. Sensory details (bubbling cauldrons, shimmering liquid) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (button/amulet), thematic depth ("borrowed valor"), and a resonant ending. Subtext about vulnerability elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The twist on "mended fences" and the spy's moral ambiguity feel fresh. Minor deduction for slightly predictable redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering reflection on altruism.</comment>
