<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's "perfectly flawed" nature is well-integrated, balancing curiosity and methodical precision. Her motivation is clear, though her mocking tone slightly undercuts her depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. The portal's discovery and grace harvesting create a satisfying arc, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (carvings, cobbler) enhancing the mystical tone. The setting and object (artifact tag) are meaningfully linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cobbler as password) and subtext (mundane vs. extraordinary). The ending resonates, though the mocking tone occasionally dilutes emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "grace" concept and librarian-guardian twist stand out, though the mocking sincerity occasionally feels overplayed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about legacy and secrecy.</comment>
