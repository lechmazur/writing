<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "naive summoner" trait could be more deeply explored to show growth or deeper flaws.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The fragment's elevation is a strong climax, though the Brotherhood's reaction feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with evocative sensory details (e.g., moonlight through crystal ceiling). The vault and midnight gatherings enhance tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fragment as bridge) and subtext (summoning vs. connecting). Ending is purposeful, though some emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "peculiarly virtual" concept is inventive, though the lullaby motif risks slight predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the goddess's fate.</comment>
