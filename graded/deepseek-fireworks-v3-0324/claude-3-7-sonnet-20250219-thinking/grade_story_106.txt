<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jenkins' transformation from stubborn farmer to inspired explorer is compelling and well-motivated, though his initial "objectively biased" trait could be more subtly woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent and satisfying, but the underwater city discovery feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The barren farm and submerged power station are vividly contrasted, with sensory details (cracked hands, murky water) enhancing atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stamps as passports, quilt as canvas) and a resonant theme of breaking generational cycles. Ending lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic voice, though "borrowed valor" tone occasionally overrides Jenkins' natural voice. Fresh metaphors elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
