<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Markus is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his edginess occasionally feels overplayed. His actions align well with his existential drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the windmill's collapse and dimensional shift creating urgency. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mushroom house and bioluminescent atmosphere are masterfully rendered, immersing the reader in a surreal yet cohesive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candle, watches) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor stiffness in Markus's dialogue ("Right on schedule") slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering existential weight.</comment>
