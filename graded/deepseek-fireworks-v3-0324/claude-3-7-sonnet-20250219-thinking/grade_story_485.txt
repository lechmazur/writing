<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with clear, nuanced motivations. Mira's brazen yet conflicted nature and Elise's weary brilliance are well-drawn, though Elise's physical frailty could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent plot with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the escape route could be slightly more detailed to avoid feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building and atmosphere. The submerged lab and social upheaval are vividly rendered, with sensory details (algae-light, murky waters) enhancing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful storytelling with rich symbolism (charcoal, locket) and emotional depth. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though Mira's internal conflict could be slightly more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. Avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fractured grace") and nuanced emotion. Minor flaw: "sea monsters" feels slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
