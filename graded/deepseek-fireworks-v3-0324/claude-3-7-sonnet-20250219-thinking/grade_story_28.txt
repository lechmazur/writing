<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "sly agent" trait feels underdeveloped. His desperation to preserve folklore is compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the climax (fork capturing voices) could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the eerie mood. A standout strength.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The folklore angle feels fresh, though the "sly agent" framing is somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
