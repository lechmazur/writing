<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morgan's superstitious nature and professional expertise create a compelling duality, but her motivation to transcend the physical realm feels slightly abrupt given her established pragmatism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the scavenger hunt and notebook discovery driving the narrative logically toward the climactic cave exploration. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater cave system is vividly rendered, with bioluminescence and impossible physics enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (pressure shifts, darkness) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (compass, membrane between worlds) and layered themes (liminality, ancestral wisdom) elevate the story. The ending is haunting and resonant, though Eliza's integration could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is precise yet evocative, though the "women's wisdom" theme edges toward didacticism in Eliza's poems.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brief length feels intentional, leaving the reader with lingering questions about permeability and legacy.</comment>
