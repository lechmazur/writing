<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, blending professional pride with personal vengeance. His "clumsily dexterous" hands add a unique physicality, though his emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The silent retribution concept drives the narrative elegantly, though the pantomime mechanism risks feeling slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cauldron room is vividly rendered, with sensory details (candlelight, bubbling potions) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The stained glass fragment ties beautifully to both setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stained glass as fractured truth) and subtext (corporate critique). The ending is satisfyingly ironic, though the "practical illusion" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors ("silence like a freshly erased chalkboard"). Avoids clichés, though the witch’s role feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of manipulation.</comment>
