<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Huxley's motivation is clear and compelling, with her "merry bitterness" adding depth. The agents' collective resistance and Martinez's individual struggle are well-articulated, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from preparation to transformation. The wax-drip method is inventive and drives the narrative forward logically, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the "charged" night air and candlelit ritual enhancing the eerie, experimental atmosphere. Sensory details (wax chimes, synchronous breathing) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (wax as psyche, hexagon as harmony) and subtext (Huxley's hidden agenda). The ending lingers, posing ethical questions about identity and control.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The hive-mind concept is fresh, and the prose balances precision with lyricism ("sound of hindsight"). Only minor stiffness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
