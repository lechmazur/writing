<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leonard's grumpy yet endearing personality is well-developed and consistent, with his motivation to protect the orchard feeling organic. His reluctance to embrace his role as mayor adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The overheard conversation efficiently sets the conflict in motion, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The swamp orchard and carnival settings are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The polluted water and monks' reclusiveness deepen the stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the beetle, mural) and subtext (fate vs. choice). The ending balances satisfaction with Leonard's trademark reluctance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh and original, avoiding clich√©s. The clockwork beetle as a purifier is inventive, and Leonard's voice feels distinct. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the short length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, leaving room for reflection on community and destiny.</comment>
