<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's cybernetic enhancements and veterinary oath create a compelling, consistent motivation. Her defiance of the Council reveals depth and moral conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect (reef decline → forbidden intervention → bacterial solution). Pacing balances urgency with atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged dystopia and kaleidoscopic coral are vividly rendered. Sensory details (pulsing coral, train sediment) amplify the tension between technology and nature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bucket as relic, coral as lifeline) and subtext (human/machine duality) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("devour a sacred taboo") and nuanced emotion (reef's "luminescent display of trust") avoid cliché. The cybernetic-veterinarian premise is strikingly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic depth.</comment>
