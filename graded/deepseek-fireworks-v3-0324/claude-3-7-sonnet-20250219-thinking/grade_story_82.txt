<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and compelling, blending reluctance with a deeper drive to uncover mysteries. His "analytically playful" nature is subtly shown through his decoding efforts, though more direct interaction with the orchard's curse could deepen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dragon tooth discovery and farmhouse explorations driving the narrative logically toward the revelatory ending. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the futuristic hub setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard's haunting atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (whispering fruit, rotting farmhouses) enhancing the mood. The contrast between New Aurora's futuristic gleam and the orchard's ancient decay is striking but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dragon tooth, living crystal) and layered themes (memory, guardianship) elevate the story. The ending is emotionally resonant and thematically satisfying, though the "gleeful sorrow" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dragon-orchard mythology, but some phrases ("gleeful sorrow," "dark stain") edge toward clich√©. The narrative avoids AI pitfalls but could benefit from more nuanced emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements, with the dragon tooth and farmhouses serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
