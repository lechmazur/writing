<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is clear and consistent, with her grandfather's apron and her minstrel role adding depth. Her cautiousness and revolutionary intent are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The connection between her actions and the Council's suppression is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescence, saltwater). The Forgotten Shore and Coralline enhance the story's mood and themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (apron, piano) and subtext (consciousness patterns). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "melodies like forgotten promises"). Avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct voice. Minor overuse of "luminescent."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about memory and rebellion.</comment>
