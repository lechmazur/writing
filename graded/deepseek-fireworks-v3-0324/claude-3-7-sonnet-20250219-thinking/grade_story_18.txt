<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gregor's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his tragic yet hopeful outlook. His telepathy adds a unique layer to his character, though his "tragically joyful" attribute could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Gregor's imprisonment to his liberation. The connection between weatherizing and calligraphy is inventive, though the centennial celebration feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the hissing valves and clanking carriages immerse the reader, though the timeframe ("throughout planning") could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and literary craft, with strong symbolism (hair ties, ink runes) and a satisfying ending. The theme of truth vs. deception is subtly but effectively explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The living statue and ink method are fresh, and the emotional nuance feels genuine. Minor quibble: "gloomy cheerfulness" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. The only weakness is the slightly underdeveloped timeframe.</comment>
