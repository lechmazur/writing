<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elliot's "fiercely nonchalant" demeanor contrasts compellingly with his high-stakes task, revealing depth. His motivation ("to kiss the horizon of madness") is vivid but slightly abstract for immediate clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the storm's chaos mirroring Elliot's poetic control. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution's abruptness slightly undermines cause-and-effect cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Steampunk details (hissing pipes, top hats) are immersive and purposeful. The dining room's contrast with external chaos heightens tension brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luminous tinderbox and pulsating manuscript stains are masterful symbols. The ending's silence-then-applause delivers emotional payoff, though Elliot's internal stakes could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("constellations of a forgotten cosmos") avoid clich√©. The bard's "tunelessness" is a clever subversion, though "brazen humility" risks feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with the airship setting amplifying the chaos theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting question: how much did Elliot sacrifice?</comment>
