<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martin's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to his grandfather's legacy. His actions align well with his quiet rebellion and curiosity, though his "passive conspirator" role could be more actively challenged.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the quantum foam's mechanics could be slightly more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of secrecy and wonder is immersive. Sensory details (e.g., the comic's texture, the vertigo of the void) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the comic as map/talisman) and layered themes (generational rebellion, hidden knowledge) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, prompting reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "reality pixelated") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "quantum foam" concept risks feeling slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic possibility.</comment>
