<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghostwriter's motivation is clear and compelling, with her actions and internal conflict well-aligned with her desire for self-determination. Her "poetically rational" mindset is subtly but effectively woven into her decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coded journals and impending speech creating urgency. The cause-and-effect chain is logical, and the pacing balances tension with reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground orchard and bio-luminescent fungi create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (cool earth, pulsing fungi) deepen the mood and mirror the character's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (sandals, fungi) and subtext (words as power). The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, and the prose elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The ghostwriter's nuanced emotions and the surreal setting defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
