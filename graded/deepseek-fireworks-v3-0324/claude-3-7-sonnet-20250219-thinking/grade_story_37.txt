<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's transformation from con artist to guardian is compelling and well-motivated, with her past subtly informing her present actions. Her "dishonestly honest" nature adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the detour feels slightly tangential. The yodeling demonstration serves as a strong climax, tying her past to her redemption.</comment>
