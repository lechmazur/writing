<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brother Thaddeus is vividly realized, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His weariness and arcane methods align perfectly with his goal of decoding the sky's language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from skepticism to acceptance. The hybrid forecasting system emerges organically, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The storm-chasing headquarters and eons-spanning timeframe create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (thunder, buttons) deepen the mood and tie into the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (buttons as translation keys, weather as dance) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of forgotten wisdom resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with no clich√©s. The fusion of meteorology and fairy tales feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple excess while remaining vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, and leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
