<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin Wei's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his professional obsession with historical authenticity into a personal quest for truth. His "rationally impulsive" nature is subtly shown through his decision to investigate rather than report the doll's dress.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to impending revelation. The cold-case mystery method drives the narrative effectively, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reimagined palace setting is vividly atmospheric, blending futuristic and historical elements seamlessly. Sensory details like sunlight through debris and dust motes enhance the mood of "anxious serenity."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's thematic depth—truth vs. illusion—is layered and thought-provoking. Literary devices (e.g., the dress as a symbol) are used deftly, though the ending's impact is slightly muted by brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dust motes like spirits"). The prose is purposeful, and Lin's emotional nuance elevates it beyond generic AI output.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, inventive whole. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic resonance. Only minor tightening would make it flawless.</comment>
