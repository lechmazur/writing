<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aric's wild upbringing and unfiltered perception are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, though his "feral" nature could be more vividly demonstrated beyond sensitivity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the newborn's cry and dandelion field serving as elegant catalysts. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the receipt method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dandelion field is a luminous, immersive setting that amplifies the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (seed tremors, wind) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scale as conduit, seeds as possibilities) and lyrical prose create profound emotional resonance. The ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "precisely random patterns"). Minor quibble: "hopeful melancholy" leans slightly toward stated emotion over subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
