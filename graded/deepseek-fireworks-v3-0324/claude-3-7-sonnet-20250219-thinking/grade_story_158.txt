<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the lullaby-to-reality-code leap requires suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ice cavern and candlelit hush create a haunting atmosphere, but the "strange new colors" at the end could be more vividly described.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative, though the brevity leaves some concepts underexplored.</comment>
