<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from grocery shopping to discovery. Pacing is effective, and the cause-and-effect logic is strong, though the grocery store callback feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower and vintage seed packets create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, faded illustrations) deepen immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of seeds, "gentle chaos") are used effectively. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of hidden legacies is explored with subtext.</comment>
