<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is deeply nuanced, with guilt and healing interwoven seamlessly. Their "manic clarity" and wilderness guide background add distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blanket's revelation driving the arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ship setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sunken ship is evocative but somewhat disconnected from the emotional core. Sensory details (coffee, blanket stitches) are strong, but the setting's potential isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ring, blanket) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of reconciliation is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "bizarre cathedral"). Emotional nuance avoids clich√©, though "manic clarity" slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the blanket and ring elevating the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate and powerful.</comment>
