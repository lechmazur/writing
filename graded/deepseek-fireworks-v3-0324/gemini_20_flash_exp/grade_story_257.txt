<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her "intellectually dreamy" attribute, though her "overqualified" nature could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the postcard method driving a coherent arc, though the fireflies feel slightly underutilized as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (fireflies, dried leaves) enhancing the mood, though the tavern's drabness could be more vividly contrasted earlier.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (postcards as hope, chalkboard as renewal) and a resonant theme of transformation. Minor quibble: "bruised exhilaration" slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The postcard method is inventive, though the fireflies verge on whimsy without deeper thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette that transcends its word limit. The elements serve the story elegantly, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
