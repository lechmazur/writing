<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her quiet strength and zeal well-portrayed. Her actions align with her traits, though her 'soft-voiced' nature could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The blackout's influence on the plot is strong, but the train choice lacks deeper justification. Pacing is decent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details enhancing the eerie stillness. The floating cloud cafe and blackout setting work well together, though the cafe's role could be expanded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story has subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict (harnessing energy) could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on overly flowery. The theme is fresh, though the "blissful agony" tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The length feels deliberate, but some ideas could be more fully explored.</comment>
