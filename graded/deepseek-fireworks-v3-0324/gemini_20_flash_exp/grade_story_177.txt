<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's rebellious nature and motivation to restore a lost art form are clear and compelling, driving her actions consistently. Her distinct voice and the way she interacts with the mask and organ reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Lyra's search to her transformative writing. The connection between the labyrinth of choices and her mission could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and hidden pipe organ chamber create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the humming resonance and shifting mask enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is strong, with rich symbolism (mask, organ) and a memorable theme of reclaiming life. The ending is purposeful, though the revolution subplot feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "pipes like skeletal fingers") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "lucid frenzy" tone occasionally strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the revolution's intersection with Lyra's mission.</comment>
