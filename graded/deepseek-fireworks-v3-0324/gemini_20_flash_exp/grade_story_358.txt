<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hemlock's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "purposefully aimless" attribute could be more deeply explored to reveal greater complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically assured, but the brevity slightly limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering, if not fully resonant, impression.</comment>
