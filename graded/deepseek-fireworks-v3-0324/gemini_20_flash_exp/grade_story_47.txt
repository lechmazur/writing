<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from dutiful ward to detective is compelling, but her initial "eagerly jaded" state could be more deeply explored to align with her later defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle-solving method driving momentum, though the stolen phones element feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" and audition backdrop are vividly rendered, enhancing the contrast between chaos and quiet, though the glove's scent could be more tactilely evoked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (glove, music) and subtext (mortality, imperfection). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though "graceless beauty" teeters on abstraction. Avoids clichés, but Thorne's voice notes could feel more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on art and legacy.</comment>
