<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's sorrow and motivation are clear, but his emotional depth could be further nuanced. His actions align well with his goal, though his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The exiled fortress and dim library enhance the mood, though the desert's relevance is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism effectively. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict could be more sharply defined. Subtext is present but subtle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper. The style is distinctive but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creatively utilizes its elements. The length works, but the ending lingers slightly too long. Leaves a thoughtful impression, though not deeply haunting.</comment>
