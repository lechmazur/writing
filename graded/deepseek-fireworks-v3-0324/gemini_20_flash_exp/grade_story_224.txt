<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "openly private" nature adding depth. His use of the ladle reveals his yearning for transformation, though his "lingering minstrel" backstory could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the meteorite method, but the rush hour setting feels underutilized. The arc is satisfying, though the pacing slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The giant's dining room is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The metallic scent and wildflower shift enhance mood, but the "rush hour" timeframe clashes tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (ladle as transformation) and subtext (silence as affirmation). The ending resonates, though the theme of escape could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (meteorite as "petrified plum"), with nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "gentle turmoil" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, but the meteorite method could feel less arbitrary with more setup.</comment>
