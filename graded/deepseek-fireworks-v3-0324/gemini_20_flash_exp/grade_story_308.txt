<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartholomew's bashfulness contrasts compellingly with his role, and his motivation to preserve art rather than destroy is clear and consistent. His rare smile and keychain detail add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dance's crescendo aligning perfectly with the net's casting. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and tides create a vivid contrast to the executioner motif, but their connection to the core action feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and subtext, with the net as a powerful metaphor for capturing ephemeral beauty. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., the net as a "sculpture of light"). Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers in the mind, elevating its themes beyond the plot.</comment>
