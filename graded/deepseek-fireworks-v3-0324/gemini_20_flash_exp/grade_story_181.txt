<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "blatant secrecy" feels slightly overstated. Her actions align well with her quest, though the romantic subplot slightly distracts from her primary drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed in the romantic pivot. The crayon doodles as a method of endorsement are inventive, but the kiss disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the floral scent feels slightly forced. The atmosphere enhances Elara's secrecy and the book's mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crayon doodles, dried flower) and subtext. The ending is purposeful but the romantic tension slightly overshadows the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The crayon doodles as a coded method stand out, though "edgy nostalgia" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the kiss feels like a narrative detour. The brevity works, though some elements (e.g., sanctuary) could be more integral.</comment>
