<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her archer background subtly influencing her introspection. The comb serves as a strong symbol of her past, though her "passionate disinterest" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the roadside attraction feels slightly contrived as a catalyst for her reckoning. Pacing is effective, though the transition to resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial bodies create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances Elara's emotional state. Sensory details (spray, gravel) are well-deployed, but the "bridge of regret" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, waterfall) and subtext, but the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed. The theme of regret is compelling, though the "social movements" thread is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "anxiously calm hum"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "bridge of regret" leans toward melodrama. Nuanced handling of emotion, though some descriptors are overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the roadside attraction and social chronicling feel tangential. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of Elara's transformation.</comment>
