<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is poetic but somewhat abstract; his actions align with his enigmatic nature, though his "superficially profound" past feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action; the spider's web trap is inventive but its execution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight create a vivid, haunting atmosphere, though the bus feels incongruous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and mood elevate the story, but the ending's resignation lacks the thematic punch it aims for.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("unforgiving road") verge on clich√©. The lens and web imagery are fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stylistically cohesive, but the bus and asteroid clash tonally. The dawn motif lingers beautifully.</comment>
