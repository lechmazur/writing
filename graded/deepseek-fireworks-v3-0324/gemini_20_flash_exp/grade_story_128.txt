<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Khepri's hesitantly bold nature is well-explored, but his archer background feels underutilized. Motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the recipe, though the subtitle method feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the palace's decay. The fading photograph ties beautifully to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, recipe) and thematic depth. Ending is purposeful but could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (hidden magic, portal). Language avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic flair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the archer and subtitles feel tangential. Story lingers but not profoundly.</comment>
