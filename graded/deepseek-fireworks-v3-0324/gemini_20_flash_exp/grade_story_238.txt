<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with a paradoxical charm and gloom, but his motivation to reclaim the light feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by his method of listening, though the resolution of "reclaiming the light" remains nebulous, leaving the arc slightly unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is masterfully evoked with rich sensory details, amplifying the eerie, transient atmosphere and Silas's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wallet, light) and subtext, though the ending's promise of a "new reality" feels more suggestive than fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clichés, but some phrases ("storm clouds brewing over a forgotten sea") edge toward over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s brevity slightly undermines the weight of Silas’s quest. Still, it lingers evocatively.</comment>
