<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but her "proudly humble" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the dice/diaries, though the space pirate brig feels underutilized as a setting for the core conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (e.g., the "sliver of light" and ship's hum), though the brig's connection to the diaries is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, fading star) and emotional resonance, but the ending's thematic resolution leans slightly toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "alarm bells of heartbreak"), though the "grave playfulness" tone occasionally wavers into inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the space pirate setting feels less integral than the diaries/dice. The length suits the story's depth.</comment>
