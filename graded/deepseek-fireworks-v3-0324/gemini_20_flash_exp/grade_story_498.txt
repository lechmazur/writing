<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's detour, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is effective within the word limit, with a clear cause-and-effect chain.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The midwinter setting and xenophobic enclave are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (pine scent, frozen ground) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seed pods as hope) and evocative prose elevate the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. Shows rather than tells effectively.</comment>
