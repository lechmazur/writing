<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "mildly curious" nature feels understated for the weight of his quest. His actions align well, but his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with a clear arc. The rain method is unconventional but logically integrated. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ship graveyard and rain create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt spray, barnacles, humming wood) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evokes profound emotional resonance. Literary devices (symbolism of rain, ring box) are masterfully used. The ending is bittersweet and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The rain-as-time metaphor feels fresh. Nuanced handling of grief and memory elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. Creative and deeply thoughtful.</comment>
