<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartholomew's tragicomic duality is compelling, but his motivation to bottle a star's breath feels slightly disjointed from his established persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic holds, but the transition from obsession to concession could be smoother. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The playground and wilderness meld beautifully with the melancholic tone. Sensory details (rust, ink, fading light) are masterfully deployed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "star's breath" conceit risks tipping into pretentiousness. Nuanced emotion saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that lingers, though the premise's absurdity may alienate some readers.</comment>
