<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's reserved nature and motivation to preserve ancestral practices are well-integrated, but his "honestly dishonest" paradox could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the music box and bats' flight driving a coherent, quantum-altering arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden's eerie, shimmering flora and crystalline trees create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that amplifies the story's mystical tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bats as ink, music box as key) and layered subtext about manipulation vs. preservation elevate this beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("whisper of forgotten stars") edge toward purple prose. The quantum-garden concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. Elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
