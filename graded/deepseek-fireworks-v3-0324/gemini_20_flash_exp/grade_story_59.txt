<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his 'mournful troubadour' persona feels slightly underdeveloped beyond the melancholic archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's quest, though the star-trail method feels abrupt and could benefit from more organic integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details amplifying the silence and emptiness, though the 'silent struggles' timeframe is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (collar, star trails) and subtext, but the ending's emotional payoff is muted by the abstract resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the star-trail method and echo chamber feel like imposed elements rather than organic choices.</comment>
