<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's "cynically hopeful" attribute is well-integrated, shaping his actions and internal conflict. His motivation is clear, though the speed dating backstory feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. The speed dating event disrupts pacing; the herb ritual is stronger but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (woodsmoke, herbs) immerse the reader. The observatory and "hush" timeframe amplify the mood, though the orchard connection is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herbs, horizon) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the speed dating detracts from emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("charred serenity") verge on purple prose. The drone pilot twist is fresh, though the worldbuilding lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the speed dating feels tacked on. The length suits the mood, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
