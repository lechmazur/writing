<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's carefree gambler persona contrasts effectively with his newfound purpose, but his transition could be more nuanced. The "uniquely trustworthy" attribute is well-integrated but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the blueprint, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships feeling rushed. The arc is clear but could benefit from more organic pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop and island memories create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (solder, videotapes) enhance immersion, though the "hush of old videotapes" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (blueprint as a map) and subtext (harmony in chaos). The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the blueprint's dual role, but some phrases verge on flowery. The gambler trope is handled well, though the "hammered repose" tone feels inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the word limit strains thematic depth. The story lingers, but a fuller exploration of Finn's past would strengthen impact.</comment>
