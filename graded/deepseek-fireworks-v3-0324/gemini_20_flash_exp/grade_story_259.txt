<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intriguing, but her "normally unusual" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her curiosity-driven nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the telescope's discovery, but the accidental double-booking feels contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant setting is vividly rendered, and the contrast with the telescope creates a compelling atmosphere. Sensory details enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are effective, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of hidden creation myths is thought-provoking but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (e.g., "forgotten tongue"). Language is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the double-booking weakens plausibility. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though the climax feels abrupt.</comment>
