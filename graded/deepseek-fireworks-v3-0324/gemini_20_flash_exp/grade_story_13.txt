<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's solemnity and purpose are clear, but his "mild fervor" could be more vividly contrasted with his swordsman identity to deepen his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on poetic abstraction; the urgency of "localizing" evolutionary shifts could be more concretely tied to the garden's role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory and shifting sands create a rich, ephemeral atmosphere, though the clock tower's relevance to the garden wisdom feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism and subtext elevate the story, but the poems-as-method lacks tactile detail to fully land their emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into overly ornate phrasing ("functionally dysfunctional" feels forced). The seed's duality is a standout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the tight word limit strains the integration of all elements (e.g., the magician's lab feels tangential).</comment>
