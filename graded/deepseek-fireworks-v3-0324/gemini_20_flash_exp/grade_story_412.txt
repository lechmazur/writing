<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's bookishness and assassin role are well-integrated, but her motivation to "soothe" through nightmares feels slightly inconsistent with her assassin title.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the rubber key cover, but the cyclical nightmares method could be more clearly linked to the director's breakdown.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frequency monitoring station is vividly atmospheric, and the mournful elation tone enhances the setting's cold, calculative nature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rubber key cover as conduit) and subtext, though the ending's hopeful resolution slightly undercuts the mournful tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "geographically challenged" feels underutilized. Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the director's transformation.</comment>
