<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas's transition from minstrel to cartographer is compelling, but his "dismayed" nature feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the photographs, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the word limit constraints show.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the sky-lounge and endless city creating a rich atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (watch band, gardens) and a memorable premise. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "laconic exuberance" feels slightly forced. The prose is stylish without being overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
