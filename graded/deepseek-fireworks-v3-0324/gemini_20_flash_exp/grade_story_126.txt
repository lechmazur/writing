<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' rebellious motivation is clear and consistent, but his "honestly strange" attribute could be more deeply explored to justify his extreme actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias' ascent, but the travel poster as a ladder strains plausibility. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile space station contrasts powerfully with the lost Earth, and the butter churn's symbolism is evocative. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butter churn, poster) and subtext about manufactured reality. Ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "aloof passion" occasionally feels overstated. Nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
