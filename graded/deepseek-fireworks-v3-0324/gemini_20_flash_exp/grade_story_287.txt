<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her obsession with solar cycles well-established. Her "torn visionary" nature and stubborn optimism are effectively woven into her actions and decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's quest, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is clear, but the pacing could be smoother.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the cellphone as a bridge to the past) and evokes a quiet determination. The ending is purposeful, though slightly abrupt. Literary devices are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The writing style is distinctive and avoids purple prose, though some descriptors could be sharper.</comment>
