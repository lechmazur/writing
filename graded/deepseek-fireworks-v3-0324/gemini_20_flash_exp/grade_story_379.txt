<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly portrayed with a clear, paradoxical motivation, though his "trickster" nature could be more sharply defined through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by dares, but the connection between milking a cow and saving languages feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome and bioluminescent cow are evocative, but the "stretching" timeframe is underutilized. Atmosphere expertly supports the mission's urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (gift tag, fading ink) and thematic depth elevate the story, though the ending lacks a definitive emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of futuristic farming and linguistic preservation is inventive, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, but the dares occasionally feel contrived. Leaves a lingering question about Silas's ultimate role.</comment>
