<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartholomew's edgy, pessimistic nature is well-developed and drives his meticulous actions. His motivation to reconstruct the past is clear and consistent, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the vectorization attempt, but the windmill's role feels slightly underutilized. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom house and blurry vividness create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, windmill groans) are evocative, but the setting's connection to memory could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (watches, candle) and subtext about memory elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict is introspective and small-scale.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The vectorization concept is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Nuanced handling of pessimism stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite many elements. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy. Style supports clarity without sacrificing depth.</comment>
