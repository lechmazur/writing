<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to their role as a guardian of traditions, but their "aggressively kind" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the whistle's fling serving as a pivotal moment that connects beginning and end. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The whistle's contrast with the ancient stone is a standout touch.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as key, whale song as wisdom) and a resonant theme of cultural preservation elevate this beyond surface narrative. The ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "brazen calm" tone occasionally clashes with the urgency of the motivation. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
