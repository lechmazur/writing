<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's headstrong nature and motivation to bring color back are clear and consistent, but her "merry bitterness" could be more deeply explored to fully round out her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Lyra's defiance to her fleeting triumph. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The contrast between decay and glitter is masterfully evoked through sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stained glass box, glitter) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The emotional resonance is strong, though the theme of "confession" could be more explicitly woven in.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The glitter-as-rebellion metaphor is inventive, though some phrasing ("merry bitterness") risks feeling slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. The elements serve the story beautifully, leaving a lingering hope against desolation. Only minor tightening could elevate it further.</comment>
