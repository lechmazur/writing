<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's uncertainty and druidic nature are well-integrated, but her motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" feels slightly abstract. Her actions align with her traits, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from auditions to repair shop feels abrupt. Pacing is effective, though the word limit strains cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blend of tech and nature is evocative, and sensory details (neon, hum of repairs) enhance immersion. The repair shop's atmosphere perfectly contrasts with the auditions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lunch tin, wildflowers) and subtext about beauty. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors, but some phrases ("lethargic excitement") verge on contrived. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the concept of "obligation" could be deeper.</comment>
