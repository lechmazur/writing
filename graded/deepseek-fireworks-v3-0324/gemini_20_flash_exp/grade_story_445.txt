<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc is clear, but the hiking trail's role as a catalyst is underdeveloped. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the hiking trail detour weakens momentum.</comment>
