<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her profession, but the "unusually usual" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her transformation is compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the ticket punch, but the farmer's market encounter feels abrupt. Pacing is strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hangar's decay mirrors Elara's internal struggle beautifully. Sensory details are vivid and immersive, enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ticket punch, decay) is effective, and the ending is satisfying. However, some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but "ancient novelty" and "unusually usual" feel forced. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story well, though some (farmer's market) feel tacked on. The length feels deliberate, and the theme lingers.</comment>
