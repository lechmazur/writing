<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's compassion and mage background are well-integrated, but her "hopeful brutality" feels slightly underdeveloped. Her motivation is clear, though the locket's connection to her lineage could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the locket's alignment method being inventive and logical. Pacing is excellent, though the submarine hull's relevance could be foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, blending the intelligence center's secrecy with ancestral mysticism. Sensory details (old paper, rusted metal) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (locket as map) and subtext (lineage vs. secrecy). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "hopeful brutality" could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The submarine hull method is particularly inventive. Minor overuse of adjectives ("precisely messy") slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of ancestral connection and quiet determination.</comment>
