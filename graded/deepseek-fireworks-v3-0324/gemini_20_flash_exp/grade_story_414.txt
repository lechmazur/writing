<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and consistent, but Elara's depth feels slightly underdeveloped. Their interactions reveal personality, but more nuance would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the dance class feels abrupt. The barricade action is strong, though the transition to the cavern could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake and cavern are vividly rendered, enhancing atmosphere. The scrimshaw's connection to the setting is compelling but slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, but the theme of art's impact could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "gentle sharpness" tone wobbles. The scrimshaw's role feels fresh, but some prose edges toward over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the dance class detracts slightly. The length feels deliberate, though tighter focus on the lake/scrimshaw would strengthen it.</comment>
