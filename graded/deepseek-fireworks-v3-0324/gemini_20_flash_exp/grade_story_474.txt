<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, transitioning from passive observer to active rebel. His connection to the chessboard and Anya's plight is well-developed, though his "radio host" trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the chessboard's symbolism, but the cooking class introduction feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the rebellion's stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (obsidian, bone, shifting shadows) enhance the mood, though the setting's connection to the rebellion could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (chessboard as a map, missing pawns as silenced voices) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of diversity could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the cooking class detour feels contrived. The prose is evocative but occasionally overreaches ("intricately simple"). Nuanced handling of Elias's transformation stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with creative integration of elements. The brevity works, though some concepts (diversity, rebellion) could be deeper. Leaves a lingering question about the pawns' recovery.</comment>
