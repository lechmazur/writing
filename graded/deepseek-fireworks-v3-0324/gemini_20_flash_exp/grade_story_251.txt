<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's ambivalence and "happily sad" state are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's peculiar method, but the cosmic stakes could feel more urgent. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, though the "rummage sale box" connection to the universe's design feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by Silas's detachment. The writing style is polished but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The tone is consistent, and the concept avoids clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, but the cosmic scale clashes slightly with the intimate setting. Leaves a lingering, though ambiguous, impression.</comment>
