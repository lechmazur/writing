<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and consistent, with his irate nature and abstractly physical heart driving his actions. The chopstick and tea leaves reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the tea leaves' revelation, but the transition from waterfalls to the docking bay feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and pre-dawn chill create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (worn boots, bitter tea) enhance the mood and align with Jax's motives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. Shows rather than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The chopstick and tea-leaf method feel fresh. Nuanced handling of emotion, though some phrases border on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about what Jax is truly seeking. Style supports clarity and depth.</comment>
