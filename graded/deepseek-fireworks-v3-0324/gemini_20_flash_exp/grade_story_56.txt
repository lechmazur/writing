<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly portrayed with a swindler's charm and a paradoxical lethargy, but his motivation to reveal truth feels slightly at odds with his established deceitful nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the computer's restart, though the meet-cute device is somewhat contrived. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard and skyscraper ruin create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (rustling trees, flickering screen) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (price tag, Walden) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue leans slightly toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "invisible allies" concept is intriguing, though Silas's duality could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about truth and perception.</comment>
