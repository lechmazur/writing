<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "lonesome minstrel" role feels underdeveloped. The rubber stamp and rivalry deepen her character, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. The rivalry drives the narrative, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "rooftop horse stables" feel slightly incongruous. The atmosphere effectively supports the conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of natural vs. manufactured is compelling but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The handling of emotion is subtle, and the narrative avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit strains the story's depth. The elements serve the narrative well, though some feel slightly forced.</comment>
