<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's morose demeanor and motivation are clear, but his stoicism slightly limits emotional depth. His deftness with the needle adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the blackout's role feels underdeveloped. The needle's significance elevates the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (hum of generators, glow of circuits) enhancing the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (needle as key) and subtext (exile/purpose), though the ending's satisfaction is muted by Kaelen's flat affect.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the needle's role, but "bored excitement" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the timeframe and blackout could be tighter. Leaves a lingering question about Kaelen's past.</comment>
