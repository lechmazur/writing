<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her connection to plants is vividly portrayed, but her "singularly multiple" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the shoelace disruption, but the resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is richly detailed, blending mechanical and botanical elements effectively, though the "thought experiment" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and sensory details, but the "test of faith" concept lacks deeper exploration, and the ending, while satisfying, could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into flowery prose. The plant-whisperer angle is fresh, though some metaphors (e.g., "violin string breaking") feel overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, but the brevity slightly limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering impression but could be sharper.</comment>
