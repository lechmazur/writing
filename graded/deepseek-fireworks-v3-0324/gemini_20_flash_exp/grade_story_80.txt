<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear but his "ingeniously clueless" nature feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper nuance or contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the transition from logs to roller coaster feels abrupt; pacing is strong within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with vivid sensory details, though the roller coaster setting's connection to the logs is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (doorknob, erosion) and thematic depth, but the ending lacks resolution or punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("quiet mania") verge on overused. Nuanced handling of obsession.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the roller coaster feels like a forced inclusion. Leaves a lingering question about time's nature.</comment>
