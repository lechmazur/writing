<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his telepathic abilities and stone form, though his "tragically joyful" attribute could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's calligraphy, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting and gloomy cheerfulness tone are richly evoked, with sensory details (hissing pipes, shimmering ink) enhancing immersion. The hair tie's connection to the setting is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink as truth, hair tie as lost innocence) and emotional resonance, though the ending’s hope feels slightly abrupt. Theme of truth vs. deception is layered but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (ink like a "miniature galaxy"), though "tragically joyful" risks cliché. Avoids AI tropes, but some phrases ("fragile bloom in the desolate landscape") edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story’s theme, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about truth’s fragility, though the calligraphy method slightly overshadows other elements.</comment>
