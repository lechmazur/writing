<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her unconventional method of using scent to untangle the past adds depth to her character. Her cynicism and detachment are consistent, though her "innocent cynicism" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. The pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect logic holds. The tight word limit is used effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party atmosphere are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (stale cake, rain scent) enhancing mood. The setting reinforces the theme of transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant. The writing style elevates the story's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The rain-scent method is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering thought about the futility of power-seeking.</comment>
