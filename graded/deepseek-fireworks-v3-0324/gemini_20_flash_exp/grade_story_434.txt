<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the beginning and end could be tighter. The method of outmaneuvering entities with the flame is inventive but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The recording booth setting enhances the eerie tone, and the napkin's connection to the other realm is compelling.</comment>
