<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and aligns with her "underestimated rebel" trait, but her "sadly joyful" attribute feels underdeveloped. The knife's comfort is a strong touch, but her emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the cuisine ritual, which feels abrupt. The haunted house setting and call setup work, but the transition to cooking lacks smooth cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The decaying amusement park is vividly rendered, and the "ephemeral gloom" tone enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details (spices, phone ring) are effective, though the haunted house's pulse feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (culinary metaphor, gloom/hope contrast) are strong, but the ending's hopeful shift is rushed. Theme of adaptation is clear, but the cuisine element dilutes its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "rebirth in decay" tropes. The cuisine twist feels contrived, and some phrasing ("sadly joyful tremor") leans toward artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the cuisine focus strains logic. The length feels deliberate, though the storyâ€™s depth is uneven. Leaves a flicker of intrigue, but not lasting resonance.</comment>
