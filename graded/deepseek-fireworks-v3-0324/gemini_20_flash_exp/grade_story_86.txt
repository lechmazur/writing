<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's apprehension and exceptional skill with her bow are well-established, but her motivation to rescue truth feels slightly underdeveloped given the cyberpunk setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lyra's actions, though the transition from archer to digital savior could be smoother. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "ancient timeline" connection feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (candle, dawn) and evokes emotional resonance, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of archer and cyberpunk, but some phrases feel formulaic ("digital labyrinth," "fabricated data").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements, though the hot air balloon festival feels tacked on. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
