<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's rashness and protectiveness are well-established, but her sudden shift to quiet introspection feels slightly abrupt. Her cosmic yearning is compelling but could be more deeply integrated with her initial traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the transition from chaos to cosmic revelation is somewhat rushed. The postcard's role as a catalyst is effective, though the detour's execution lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fortress and caverns are vividly rendered, with sensory details (wind, whispers) enhancing the mystical tone. The setting powerfully mirrors Elara's internal shift.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (postcards as keys) and evocative prose, but the theme of cosmic connection occasionally overshadows character nuance. The ending resonates but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its cosmic introspection, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("tapestry of the universe"). Emotional resonance is shown, not told, though the prose occasionally strains for grandeur.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though the cosmic theme might benefit from more grounding in Elara's personal stakes.</comment>
