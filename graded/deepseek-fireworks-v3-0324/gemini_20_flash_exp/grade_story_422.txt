<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's selective mutism and ventriloquism are well-integrated into his character, revealing depth through his interactions with the coffee sleeve and overheard conversations. His motivation to archive weather patterns adds a unique layer, though his optimism could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kai's eavesdropping, but the parallel universe beach feels underutilized. The resolution is satisfying, though the storm's arrival could be more climactic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The phosphorescent waves and swirling sky create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The parallel universe beach is intriguing but could be more fleshed out to enhance the story's strangeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (coffee sleeve) and subtext (chosen family). The emotional resonance is strong, though some transitions feel abrupt. The ending is poignant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., echoes of phone calls). Kai's nuanced reactions and the surreal setting elevate it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The elements coalesce well, though the parallel universe and weather archiving could be more tightly woven. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
