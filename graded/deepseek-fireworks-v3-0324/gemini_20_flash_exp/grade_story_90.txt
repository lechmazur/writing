<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby's contrition and transformation are compelling, but his shift from rigid swordsman to introspective guide feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves resolution, but the yarn-as-regret device borders on contrivance, and the spa setting's absurdity isn't fully leveraged.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating island spa is vividly surreal, but its potential as a thematic counterpoint to Barnaby's rigidity is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "freed by kindness" theme risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the ending's moral clarity slightly undermines the story's earlier ambiguity.</comment>
