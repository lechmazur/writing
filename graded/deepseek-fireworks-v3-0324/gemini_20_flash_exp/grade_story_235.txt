<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hana's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "remote" trait feels underutilized. Her actions align well with her introspective nature, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolism, which risks overshadowing narrative momentum. Pacing is deliberate, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The castle and wisteria create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., pressed flowers, meteor showers) are evocative and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's subtlety borders on ambiguity. The theme of unspoken connection is poignant but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept, but some phrasing leans flowery ("distant intimacy"). Avoids clich√©s, though the meteor shower decoding feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the castle's "reimagined" aspect feels underexplored. The brevity suits the story's meditative tone.</comment>
