<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "smiling saboteur" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. Her connection to the mannequins is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed in places. The connection between the mannequins and the star's wrath could be more logically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are effective, though the gorge's role could be more pronounced.</comment>
