<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, blending necromancy with intellectual curiosity. His "hushed" demeanor and nostalgic love for old movies add depth, though his necromantic side feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's mapping mission, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The arc is clear but could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave and its pulsing energy are vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (humming air, graphite scratches) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "quiet storm of intellect") are strong, and the theme of understanding vs. domination is compelling. The ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of necromancy and nostalgia feels fresh, though the "sound of resolve" concept leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of Silas's quiet determination.</comment>
