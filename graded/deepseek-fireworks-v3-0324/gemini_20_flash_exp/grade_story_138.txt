<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Auberon's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his forgotten nobility, but his "hollow recklessness" could be more vividly explored to fully align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Auberon's defiance, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of his symbolic act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is richly evoked, but the "between text messages" timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing the setting's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a memorable ending. The theme of truth through fragmented memories is compellingly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The drone's repurposing is a standout creative choice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the lab setting slightly overshadows other elements. Leaves a lingering question about Auberon's future.</comment>
