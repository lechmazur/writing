<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and consistent, with his streetwise nature and instinctual trust in the brooch revealing depth. His actions align well with his desire to harvest hope, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the reversed patterns driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the brooch as a key, the withered flower) and evocative prose create emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>
