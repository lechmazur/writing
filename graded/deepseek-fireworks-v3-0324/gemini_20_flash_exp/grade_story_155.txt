<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Finn's "patiently impatient" nature is well-integrated, driving his actions and reactions. His motivation is clear, though his underwater welding background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the temporal anomaly's mechanics could be clearer. The ending resolves the immediate tension but leaves broader questions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the nightclub's mirrored walls and temporal distortions enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "pulsing bass," "swirling lights") are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (button box, mirrors) and subtext (inherited power). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The vintage button box and temporal unraveling are fresh concepts, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the underwater welder detail feels tangential.</comment>
