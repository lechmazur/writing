<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' aloofness and cartographer background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "learn the language of the soul" feels slightly abstract. His connection to kayaking adds depth, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The tile as a "key" works, but the mall setting feels underutilized in driving action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic mall contrasts brilliantly with the ceramic tile's antiquity. Sensory details (holograms, hover-carts) enhance immersion, though the kayaking memory could be more vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (tile as portal) and subtext (memory vs. modernity). The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance wavers slightly in the middle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "eager resignation" feels slightly forced. The prose is evocative without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. The length feels deliberate, though the mall's role could be sharper.</comment>
