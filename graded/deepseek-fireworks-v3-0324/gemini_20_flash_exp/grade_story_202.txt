<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, blending meticulousness with a twisted philosophical drive. His actions align well with his "careful poisoner" persona, though his fleeting regret could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the scavenger hunt, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the latter half. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the resolution lacks full emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like "dusty starlight" and the rapier's cracked hilt deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the rapier as metaphor) are effective, and the story evokes unease. However, the ending's impact is muted by the abrupt shift away from the teenagers' fate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. Silas's nuanced motives and the museum's repurposing theme stand out, though the "code of instinct" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering unease, though the word limit slightly truncates thematic depth.</comment>
