<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sincerity and rebellious nature are well-defined, driving her actions and dialogue. Her motivation to preserve traditions is clear and consistent, though her backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The theorizing action drives the narrative, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the building's true purpose.</comment>
