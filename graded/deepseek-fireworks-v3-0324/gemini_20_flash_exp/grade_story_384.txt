<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his culinary instincts with a detective's curiosity. His "frantic" energy contrasts well with his methodical analysis, though his background as a cook could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's discovery, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the notches and the director's deception is clever but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (dust, dim light) enhancing tension. The facility's setting is underutilized—more seismic unease could heighten the stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (eraser as truth-tool) and subtext (control via fear). The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "manufactured fear" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "impossibly conceivable" motif is intriguing, though the director's calmness borders on trope. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, but the facility's role could be more pivotal. Leaves a lingering question about truth and control.</comment>
