<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' faintheartedness and intimate distance are well-integrated into his observational role, though his motivation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tapestry and drifting action driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chamber and dog-walking timeframe create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., ruler's smoothness, tapestry's threads) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ruler as false order, tapestry as cage) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor stiffness in phrasing ("intimately distant") slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about societal illusions.</comment>
