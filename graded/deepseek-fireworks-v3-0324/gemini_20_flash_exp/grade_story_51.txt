<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marco's contradiction as an "apologetic thug" is compelling, but his motivation to "learn resilience" feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his past, though his museum method could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The "silhouette" climax is effective, but the museum method feels underexplored. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "static electricity garden" is vividly atmospheric, enhancing Marco's internal tension. Sensory details (hum, rough wood) are immersive, though the museum setting is missed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crate slat, garden) and subtext about resilience. Ending is purposeful, but the theme occasionally veers into telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "quiet storm"), but "rationally subjective" feels overly formal. Avoids clich√©s, though some emotional nuance is stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the museum method feels underutilized. The length suits the introspection, leaving a lingering hope for Marco's future.</comment>
