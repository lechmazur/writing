<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his roguish charm with a deeper purpose. His cautious spontaneity adds nuance, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the climax (city awakening) feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater coral reef city is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the decaying atmosphere amplifies Finn's mission. The piano motif is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (driftwood as memory keys) and subtext (revolution through understanding). Ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on tropes (e.g., minstrel as archaeologist of consciousness). Some phrasing leans flowery, but avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the short length feeling deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about collective memory.</comment>
