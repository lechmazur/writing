<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empathy is well-integrated, shaping her actions and motivations clearly. Her quiet determination contrasts effectively with the pirates, but her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the marionette reassembly, but the connection between the journal and the asteroid's core feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The space pirate hideout and asteroid setting are vividly atmospheric, enhancing Elara's isolation. Sensory details (neon, starfish) deepen immersion, though the "mountain wisdom" concept slightly clashes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (marionette, starfish) is effective, and the theme of empathy resonates. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict with the pirates is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in Elara's method and the marionette's symbolism. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the emotional nuance avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers on empathy's power, though the "mountain wisdom" concept slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
