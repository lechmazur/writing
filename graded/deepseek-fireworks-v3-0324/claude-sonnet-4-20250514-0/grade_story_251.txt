<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's "happily sad" state and prophetic burden are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and alignment with his actions. His distinct voice and internal conflict elevate the character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the "final oath" serving as a logical and compelling driver. Pacing is excellent, though the jigsaw puzzle method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting enhances the story's isolation and stakes. Atmospheric details—like the marbles' glow—immerse the reader, though the colony itself could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (marbles as fate) and subtext (sacrifice vs. freedom). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with layered emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "cosmic scoreboard" concept is fresh, and Kael's emotional nuance avoids AI-generic phrasing. Only minor stylistic overreach in phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thematic story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
