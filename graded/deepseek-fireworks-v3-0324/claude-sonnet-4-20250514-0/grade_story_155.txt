<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation and background are clear, but his "patiently impatient" trait feels underdeveloped. His connection to the button box and his grandmother's legacy is compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is well-structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight but effective, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the fusion of drowned planetarium and nightclub is vivid, and the temporal distortion is evoked through striking sensory details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. The story excels at combining elements organically, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
