<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Beatrice's development from reluctant mayor to accepting her role is clear, with her grumpy demeanor softening believably. Her motivation aligns well with her actions, though her initial resistance could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the beetle’s discovery driving the transformation arc. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect logic (beetle → water → healing) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The swamp orchard and dawn light are vividly rendered, enhancing the story’s mystical tone. Sensory details (polluted water, ticking beetle) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (beetle as fate, water as memory) and layered themes (acceptance, transformation) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "water wisdom" concept feels unique, and metaphors (crystal veins, reluctant awe) are inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive, with all elements serving the story’s core. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder and thematic depth.</comment>
