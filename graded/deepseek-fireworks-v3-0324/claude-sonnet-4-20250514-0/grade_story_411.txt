<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's character is richly developed with a clear, haunting motivation. His repulsive fascination with human confessions adds depth, though his 73-year mechanic background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically tight, but the transition from mechanic to metaphysical curator could be smoother. The ending resolves elegantly within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and starlight river are breathtakingly original, elevating the story’s mood. Sensory details (bioluminescent fruit, corroded metal) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (opera glasses, fountain) and layered subtext. The emotional impact is profound, though the "exultant grief" duality occasionally overtells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors and no clichés. The AI-esque "liquid starlight" phrasing is the sole minor flaw in an otherwise human-voiced narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting gem. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader with lingering existential weight.</comment>
