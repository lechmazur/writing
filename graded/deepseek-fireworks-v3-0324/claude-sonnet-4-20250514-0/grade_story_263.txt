<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kelpius is vividly realized, with a distinct voice and layered motivation. His internal conflict and playful yet solemn tone add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive with a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The action (consolidating confessions) drives the narrative well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coral reef city is immersive and evocative, with sensory details that enhance the atmosphere and align perfectly with Kelpius’s introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext, effective symbolism (Mr. Bubbles as a confessional), and a satisfyingly ambiguous ending. Literary devices are used with precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are integrated seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight and creative execution.</comment>
