<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s dreamy, rebellious nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to memorialize the unremembered is clear and compelling. Her actions—like solving riddles and breaking the seal—align perfectly with her character, though minor nuances could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the riddles and letter serving as effective drivers. The resolution feels earned, but the pacing could slightly better balance the reveal with lingering atmospheric moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ivy-clad station and shifting wax seal create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the sundial’s shadow, pressed flowers) enrich the setting’s melancholy beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (the sundial, graves) and subtext (memory vs. erasure) elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the "delicate undoing" metaphor risks being slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "dreamy poet" archetype leans slightly predictable. The prose avoids clichés but could occasionally trade lyrical density for sharper immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant vignette. The elements serve the story’s theme elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate, though the climax could linger longer emotionally.</comment>
