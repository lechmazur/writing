<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, her hesitation revealing layered conflict. Her "voice" is distinct, though internal monologue dominates.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but effective; the climax hinges on a clear choice. The disruptor’s moral weight elevates the plot beyond simple sabotage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The chamber’s acoustics are brilliantly woven into atmosphere and action. Sensory details (footsteps, vibrations) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (compass, mosaic) and subtext about destruction/reconstruction. Ending lingers, though the final choice could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("tessera of colored glass"). Minor risk of over-poetic phrasing in the mosaic passage.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the chamber and compass feel essential. Word limit serves the story’s urgency.</comment>
