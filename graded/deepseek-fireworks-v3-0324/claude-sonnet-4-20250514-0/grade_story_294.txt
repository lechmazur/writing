<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong, nuanced portrayal of the bard's struggle with self-doubt and authenticity. Motivation is clear and deeply tied to her grandmother’s legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight, well-paced arc with a satisfying resolution. The prism and voicemails drive the plot organically, though the mushroom hall's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (moonbeams, rainbow fragments) enhance the fungal hall’s mystique, but the setting’s connection to the bard’s transformation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (prism, cloak) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("gorgeously awkward") and avoidance of clichés. The voicemail device is inventive, though the mushroom hall edges toward whimsical tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the prism and voicemails serving the theme of preservation. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
