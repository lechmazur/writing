<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus' motivation is clear and compelling, deeply tied to his astral abilities and sister's disappearance. His 'voice' and reactions feel consistent, though some inner conflict could deepen his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well, though the funhouse climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (groaning metal, twilight shadows). Atmosphere amplifies the eerie, liminal tone perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth (redemption, sacrifice). Symbolism (key, shadows) enriches the narrative, though the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on astral tropes. Language avoids clich√©s, though "sometimes always" repetition borders on stylistic overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere elegantly, serving the story's emotional core. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
