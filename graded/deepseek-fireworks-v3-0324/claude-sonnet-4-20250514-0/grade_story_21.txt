<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chen's measured demeanor and deep-seated vengeance are compelling, but Webb's shift from bravado to fear could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight, logical progression with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is superb for the word limit, though Webb’s realization feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (must, drum circles) heighten tension. The abandoned theater's irony is masterfully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich subtext (diplomacy as vengeance). Symbolism (tassel, vial) and crisp dialogue elevate the story. Ending lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Minor risk of trope (revenge plot) but subverted by Chen’s clinical execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly. Length feels deliberate, leaving a chilling resonance. Only flaw: Webb’s abrupt panic.</comment>
