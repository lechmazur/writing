<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "serene anger" could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tightly paced with a clear arc, though the climax with Voss feels slightly rushed. Cause and effect are logically connected.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., "flowering jasmine plant") enhancing the tension between beauty and oppression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism (e.g., the photograph in the soil), though the dialogue could feel more natural. Ending is satisfyingly thematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise with minimal clich√©s, though "serene anger" and "timely rebirth" verge on over-poeticism. Emotional nuance is mostly shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Lingers on justice and liberation, though the rebirth motif could be subtler.</comment>
