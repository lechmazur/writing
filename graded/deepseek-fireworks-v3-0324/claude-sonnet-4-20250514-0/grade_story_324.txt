<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kiera’s insecurity is clear, but her deeper psychology feels underexplored. Her motivation to chase the rumor drives the plot effectively, yet her "advisor" role lacks distinct voice or authority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect. The discovery and destruction of the brain create tension, though the ending’s abruptness slightly weakens resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout—abandoned HQ and eerie future are vividly rendered. Sensory details (echoing footsteps, luminous fluid) enhance immersion, though "simmering future" feels slightly vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brain as truth, footsteps as pursuit) and evocative prose. The ending lingers, but Kiera’s panic and its consequences could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "dreamer’s calling" edges toward cliché. Nuanced handling of ambiguity, but some phrases ("fractured idyll") feel overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story leaves unanswered questions effectively, though Kiera’s arc could be tighter.</comment>
