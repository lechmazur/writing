<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong, nuanced portrayal of Marcus and Elena; their motivations and history are deeply intertwined with the amber's symbolism, though Elena's backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is elegantly compact, with a clear arc and logical progression; the reunion resonates emotionally, though the "rumor chains" method feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric details—cathedral’s decay and artistic rebirth amplify themes; sensory immersion is masterful, though the "echoing hour" timeframe lacks deeper integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal clichés; metaphors (e.g., amber as memory) feel fresh, though "carefully reckless" verges on formulaic in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful; elements serve the narrative seamlessly, and the brevity amplifies emotional resonance without sacrificing depth.</comment>
