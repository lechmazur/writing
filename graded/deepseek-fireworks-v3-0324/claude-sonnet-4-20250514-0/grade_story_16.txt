<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's multifaceted freelancer role and the amber ring's significance create a compelling, cohesive character arc, though her "inadvertently profound" realization could be more subtly foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, but the transition from wedding aftermath to apprenticeship feels slightly abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk airship and post-wedding hush meld beautifully, with sensory details (copper pistons, whispering wind) deepening the atmosphere. Amber ring's warmth is a standout touch.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as memory, engines as rhythm) and layered themes (wisdom vs. documentation) elevate the story. Ending resonates with quiet satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original handling of steampunk tropes and fresh metaphors ("wave-song" engines). Minor flaw: "scattered harmony" tone occasionally tips into overt exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly; the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers on the interplay of tradition and innovation with emotional weight.</comment>
