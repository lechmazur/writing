<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kai's reckless nature and smuggler background are vividly portrayed, aligning well with her motivation to join the Spectral Runners. Her emotional calculus adds depth, though her "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect from audition to unmapped territory. Pacing is brisk but coherent, though the finale’s abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The haunted funhouse setting is immersive, with sensory details (warped mirrors, peeling paint) amplifying the atmosphere. The clover and map deepen the eerie, liminal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (clover, torn map) and layered themes of belonging elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the "jubilant despair" duality could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotion (e.g., "calculated joy") stands out, though some phrasing ("jubilant despair") risks overstatement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with the clover and map enriching the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on outsiderhood.</comment>
