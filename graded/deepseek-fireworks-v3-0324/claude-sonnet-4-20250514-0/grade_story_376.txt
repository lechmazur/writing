<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astrid and Magnus are well-developed, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Astrid's transition from observer to participant is subtly executed, though Magnus could benefit from deeper internal exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect progression. The pacing is deftly managed within the word limit, though the resolution leans slightly toward predictability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details that enhance the mood. The juxtaposition of ancient and modern elements strengthens the thematic resonance, though the "overlooked era" framing could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (inkwell, wine) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically rich, though the dialogue, while purposeful, occasionally verges on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is elegant but occasionally risks over-polishing emotion (e.g., "fierce repose"). Nuanced handling of hesitation elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the tension between documentation and lived experience.</comment>
