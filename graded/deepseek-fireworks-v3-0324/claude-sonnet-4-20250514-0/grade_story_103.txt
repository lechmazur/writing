<question>1</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Gareth's transformation is deeply nuanced, with clear motivation and internal conflict. His actions align perfectly with his established traits, and his 'voice' is distinct through introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the knocker's reflection serves as a brilliant narrative device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is hauntingly vivid, with sensory details amplifying the atmosphere. The jagged reefs and storm-gray sky reinforce the tone of despair and redemption.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the knocker, mementos) and subtext. The ending is profoundly satisfying, with layered themes of guilt and reclaiming agency. Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Emotional resonance is earned through nuanced character reactions. The prose is precise, avoiding purple flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful short story. Elements serve the narrative seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
