<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and poignant, anchored by personal loss and redemption. His introspection and dialogue with Chen reveal depth, though his 'uneasy emissary' role could be sharper in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the coathanger and postcards driving a coherent arc from grief to insight. Pacing is excellent, though the orbital setting feels underutilized for the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (postcards rustling, fridge hum), but the orbital station’s potential as a metaphor clashes slightly with the domestic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling: symbolism (debris vs. regeneration), layered themes, and a resonant ending. The only flaw is a slight over-reliance on exposition in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (trees growing around obstacles). Nuanced emotions, though Chen’s postcard armor edges toward quirkiness over depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful, with elements serving the story’s emotional core. The brevity feels deliberate, though the orbital setting’s payoff is muted.</comment>
