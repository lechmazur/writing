<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's storm-chasing past and mechanical restoration present are sharply defined, but her "eagerness unwillingness" could be deeper explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with the tapestry-to-carousel connection elegantly resolving the arc. Minor pacing hiccup in the transition to Brother Thomas.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The monastery and carousel are vividly rendered, with sensory details (warm tongs, frayed threads) amplifying the nostalgic-innovative tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (storms vs. restoration) and subtext, though the ending's thematic clarity slightly overpowers nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original fusion of meteorology and medieval craft, avoiding tropes. Only flaw: "inner strength" phrasing edges toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, leaving resonance—though the carousel's symbolism risks overtness.</comment>
