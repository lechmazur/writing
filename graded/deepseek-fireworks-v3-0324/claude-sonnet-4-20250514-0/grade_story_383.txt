<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's hollowed-out psyche and gradual renewal are vividly portrayed, with strong alignment between his military background, defeat, and eventual epiphany. His "voice" is distinct, though his dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's surreal structure aligns perfectly with the themes of absurdity and renewal. Pacing is tight, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity. Some transitions risk abruptness but serve the liminal tone.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner's physics-defying atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (neon, cosmic jukebox) elevate the absurdity without overshadowing character growth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (arcs, seaweed) and subtext. The ending lands with emotional precision, balancing whimsy and profundity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal premise and fresh metaphors. Nuanced handling of grief and renewal avoids clich√©. Only minor overuse of "salt" imagery slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the theme. The length feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance. Creative fusion of absurdity and emotional truth.</comment>
