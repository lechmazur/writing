<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kane's exhaustion and fractured psyche are effectively conveyed through his reliance on the kaleidoscope, but his backstory is hinted at rather than fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat compressed; the breadcrumb trail of playing cards works, but the connection between cases could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting is vivid and thematically resonant, enhancing the disorienting tone. The "hush after chaos" is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (kaleidoscope, playing card) and a layered ending. Slight over-reliance on metaphor occasionally distracts from pacing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors, though Kane’s "confidently unsure" trait feels slightly overstated. Avoids most clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh well, but the tight word limit slightly truncates the emotional payoff. Still, it lingers provocatively.</comment>
