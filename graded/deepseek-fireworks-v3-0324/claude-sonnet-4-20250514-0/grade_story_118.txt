<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong character development for Dr. Synthesis; motivations for cadets are clear but could be deeper. Hive-mind therapist's unique perspective is well-executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The wax ritual is inventive but feels slightly contrived as a central driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed. The setting enhances the eerie, introspective mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative use of symbolism and subtext. Ending is satisfying, though the theme of regret is somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and stylish, avoiding clich√©s. The hive-mind concept and wax method are fresh, though the tone wobbles occasionally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements feel forced. The length works, but the bold discovery tease is underdeveloped.</comment>
