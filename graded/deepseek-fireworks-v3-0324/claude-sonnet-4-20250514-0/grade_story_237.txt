<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her psychic abilities and family history deeply influencing her actions. Her "proudly humble" attitude adds nuance, but could be further developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from capture to revelation. The dice roll and diary whispers create a satisfying payoff, though the pirate confrontation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, blending cosmic scale with intimate details. The fading star and derelict trains are evocative, though the pirate ship's tone clashes slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—symbolism (dice, diaries), emotional resonance, and layered themes (destiny vs. agency) elevate the story. The ending is profound and thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The psychic genealogist premise and modified die twist defy clichés. Some phrases ("grave playfulness") feel slightly forced, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story organically, and the length feels deliberate. Lingers in the mind long after reading.</comment>
