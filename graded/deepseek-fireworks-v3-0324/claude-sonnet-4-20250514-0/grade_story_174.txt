<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation and regret are clear, and her transformation through the frost patterns is compelling. Her "voice" is distinct, though deeper introspection could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from regret to revelation. The waterfall library’s introduction feels slightly abrupt, but the resolution ties beautifully to the beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hidden library and frost patterns create an immersive, dreamlike atmosphere. Sensory details (frost, cascading water) enhance the setting’s magic and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (frost as memory, leaves as blueprints) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying and thematically rich, though a touch more subtlety in the mentor’s disappointment would refine it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The fusion of fireworks, memory, and temporal manipulation feels fresh. Some phrases ("ephemeral nature of time") border on ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends all elements into a poignant whole. Leaves a lingering sense of redemption and artistic transcendence. Only minor tightening of the library’s logic would perfect it.</comment>
