<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's fidgety nature and musically untalented attribute are well-integrated, driving her methodical approach to magic. Her motivation is clear, but her fear-joy balance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect linking Kira's desperation to her unconventional method. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
