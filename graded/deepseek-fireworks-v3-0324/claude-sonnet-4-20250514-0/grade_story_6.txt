<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finn's skepticism and minstrel background are well-integrated, driving his actions and dialogue with a distinct voice. His motivation to out-scheme Zephyr is clear and aligns with his traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Finn's reckless generosity driving the narrative logically and efficiently. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the factory's revival.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned factory setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hissing steam, rusted machinery) enhancing the atmosphere. The disappearing ink concept ties elegantly to the theme of impermanence and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (ink as hope) and subtext (generosity as folly). The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural. Emotional resonance is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The twist on reckless generosity is inventive, and the prose avoids purple flourishes. Character reactions feel nuanced, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels purposeful, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and thoughtful throughout.</comment>
