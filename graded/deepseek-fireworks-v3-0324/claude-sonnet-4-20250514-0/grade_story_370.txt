<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his rebellion against corporate protocols subtly revealed through his actions and the inherited comic. His "voice" is distinct, though more dialogue could deepen this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Marcus's defiance to his symbolic act of passing the comic. The quantum foam setting enhances the action, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details ("particles winked in and out of existence") amplifying the atmosphere. Tone and setting harmonize perfectly with the theme of hidden wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the comic as rebellion) and layered subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its word limit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("hope particles clustered around acts of rebellion"). Avoids clich√©s and AI pitfalls, though a few phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on generational resistance.</comment>
