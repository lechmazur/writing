<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, tying his brashness to a generational legacy. His voice is distinct, though some actions (like breaking into a store) could use more justification.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds to a purposeful climax, but the transition from anvil-forging to fireworks feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized, with sensory details (dust, flickering lights) enhancing the atmosphere. The "dancing dust particle chamber" slightly strains believability but enriches the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (nautilus shell, war medal) and emotional resonance, though the theme of reciprocity could be more subtly woven. Ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (Fibonacci fireworks), but phrases like "dusty exuberance" risk feeling forced. Avoids clichés but occasionally overreaches for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length, though some elements (e.g., the shell’s mathematical precision) demand more space to feel fully earned. Leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
