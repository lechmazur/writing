<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is deeply personal and clear, her actions align perfectly with her grief-driven rebellion against temporal laws. Her scholarly background enriches her defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight and efficient arc; the forbidden research, grandmother's voice, and final act of rebellion are seamlessly linked. Pacing balances urgency with reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (wire coil as both tool and heartstring), layered theme (love vs. erasure), and a hauntingly resonant ending. Subtext elevates the sci-fi premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh twist on time-travel tropes, avoiding clichés. "Earthbound flight" and "unspoken heart" feel organic, not forced. Nuanced emotional logic distinguishes it from AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The capsule hotel and well could feel disjointed but instead amplify the theme of hidden connections across time.</comment>
