<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Khaemwaset's fretful nature contrasts well with his bold curiosity, giving depth. His motivation is clear and evolves believably, though his transition from archer to storyteller could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a clear arc. The mirror's visions drive the narrative organically, and the resolution feels earned. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative. The palace's ancient grandeur and the mirror's eerie modernity clash brilliantly, enhancing the theme. Sensory details (torchlight, papyrus) are vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling craft. The theme of storytelling as universal magic is layered and poignant. Literary devices (symbolism of fading relief) elevate the narrative. Ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The concept of jumbled subtitles as a portal is fresh, and emotional beats feel nuanced. No clich√©s or AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. Elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
