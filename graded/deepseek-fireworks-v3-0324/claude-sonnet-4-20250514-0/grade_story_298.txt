<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is compelling and deeply integrated into the narrative. Her rationally impulsive nature effectively drives her actions, and her transformation into Lin Wei reveals emotional depth. However, Detective Chen's presence feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The reproduction of Lin Wei's performance is a clever device that propels the story forward while maintaining coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the post-oil world and ancient palace creating a rich atmosphere. Sunlight through debris enhances mood and mirrors past events. Sensory details are precise and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and thematic depth. The interplay of illusion and truth is masterfully executed, and the ending resonates. Literary devices (e.g., the dress as a symbol) are used subtly and effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced handling of emotion. Some descriptors could be sharper, but the prose is purposeful and avoids excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, with all elements serving the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, and the combination of themes (art, justice, memory) is inventive. Leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
