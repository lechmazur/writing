<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lord Pemberton’s motivation is clear and layered, blending aristocratic duty with genuine empathy. His "bumbling" persona masks sharp perception, creating a compelling contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the letter opener’s acoustic properties driving the stakes. Pacing is brisk but purposeful, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The potting-shed-as-facility setting is wryly evocative, and the juxtaposition of genteel yard work with espionage heightens tension. Sensory details (rust, moss) reinforce tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the letter opener’s symbolism (dull but sharp in use) mirrors Pemberton’s facade. Subtext about privilege and rebellion elevates the narrative. Dialogue is natural and revealing.</comment>
