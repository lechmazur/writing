<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and well-integrated, with his "carefully careless" demeanor revealing depth. His role as a dog walker adds a unique perspective, though his investigative leap feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with logical cause-and-effect, but the resolution feels rushed given the word limit. Pacing is strong, though the blood drive's role could be more pivotal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally crafted—botanical and haunted mansion elements merge seamlessly. Sensory details (e.g., "leaves rustling without breeze") elevate tension and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (plants as witnesses) and subtext (philanthropy as alibi). Dialogue is sharp, but the ending's recording device twist feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("garden of lies"), though some phrases flirt with cliché ("weight of their history"). Nuanced handling of Mrs. Ashworth's trembling guilt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylish, with elements serving the story expertly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste, though the blood drive's relevance could be sharper.</comment>
