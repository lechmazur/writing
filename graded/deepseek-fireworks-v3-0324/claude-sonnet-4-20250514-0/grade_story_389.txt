<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, but his thin-lipped attribute feels underutilized. His hunger for forbidden knowledge is compelling, though his "formally casual" demeanor could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and effective pacing. The midnight timeframe elevates tension, but the climax’s abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—crystalline formations, whispering voices, and crumbling dust create vivid immersion. The mine/library setting is richly symbiotic with the artifacts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and literary devices (e.g., the figurehead’s heartbeat-like pulse). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "confusing certainty" tone is unique, though slightly over-relied on. Metaphors (e.g., "frozen thoughts") are inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative fusion of elements. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of doomed immortality.</comment>
