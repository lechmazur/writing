<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elena's solitude and birdwatching obsession are vividly portrayed, her motivation ("cosmic chaos as a birthright") is original and consistent, and her mask symbol ties into nonviolence with striking clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with the "cosmic blink" serving as a compelling hinge. The arc—from observation to transformation—feels complete despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The leaf classification office and cosmic blink create a hypnotic atmosphere. Sensory details (porcelain, marble reflections) amplify the eerie, introspective mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (mask, heron) and subtext. The ending resonates deeply, and the prose is lush yet precise, showing rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice, no clichés. The mask metaphor and "braided bitterness" tone feel fresh, and emotion is conveyed through nuanced imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A masterclass in brevity: every element serves the theme of chaos/gentleness cohesion. Leaves a lingering meditation on stillness as power.</comment>
