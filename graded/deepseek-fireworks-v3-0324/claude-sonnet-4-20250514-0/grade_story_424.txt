<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elaine's motivations are clear and deeply tied to her father's legacy, but her "mild zealot" trait could be more vividly demonstrated through actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a satisfying arc, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax. The connection between chaos theory and sacrifice is well-executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rustic lab setting and defunct currency create a rich, evocative atmosphere that enhances the theme of legacy. Sensory details are sparing but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (currency, equations) and a resonant theme of unfinished legacy. The ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "forgotten wishes" method occasionally feels abstract, but the prose is precise and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the tight word limit slightly truncates emotional depth. Leaves a lingering thought on legacy.</comment>
