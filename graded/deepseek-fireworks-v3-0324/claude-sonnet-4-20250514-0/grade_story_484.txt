<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus is vividly characterized as a groggy brewer with a clear motivation—transforming his craft into a defiant statement. His actions align well with his rebellion against corporate greed, and his "voice" shines through his grim determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Magnus's quest for transformation, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between protest, brewing, and darkness is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard and fermenting darkness create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (moonlight on the mirror, spilled wine-like stains) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (mirror, fermentation as rebellion) and subtext, though the ending’s impact is slightly diluted by abruptness. The theme of craft-as-resistance is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The blend of brewing and revolution feels fresh, and the flippant solemnity adds nuance. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively executed, with elements serving the story’s core theme. Leaves a lingering thought about art as defiance, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
