<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, her 'voice' distinct, and her actions align with her desire for legend status, though her pivot to soup-serving feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the twist to interdimensional soup kitchen slightly undermines the initial stakes. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the resolution leans more whimsical than profound.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (pulsing carvings, soup aroma), enhancing the absurdity and atmosphere. Portal stones and generational duty are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of irony and subtext (soup as grace), though the emotional shift from ambition to absurdity lacks depth. Dialogue is purposeful, and the ending is satisfyingly unexpected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The tomato soup twist subverts expectations, and the tone balances mockery and sincerity without cliché. Nuanced handling of absurdity elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story’s theme of legacy and absurdity. Creative combination of mundane and mystical leaves a lingering, playful thought. Length feels deliberate.</comment>
