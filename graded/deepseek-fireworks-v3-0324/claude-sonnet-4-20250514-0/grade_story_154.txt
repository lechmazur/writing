<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maeve's motivation is clear and consistent, with her frazzled courier role and deep connection to cultural preservation shining through. Her "strongly weak" attribute adds nuanced depth to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ink pot's levitation serving as a pivotal moment that resolves the tension between tradition and modernity. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
