<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's crisis of faith is vividly portrayed, and his transformation feels earned. His ritual with the fork and obsession with decoding the piano reveal depth, though his "capriciously consistent" trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's progression from doubt to revelation is tightly structured, with the fork and piano serving as potent symbols. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, but the "capriciously consistent" detail feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The glass desert is hauntingly evocative, and the piano's discordant melodies amplify the mystical tone. Sensory details (light on the fork, wind-song) are masterfully deployed to immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, fork, piano) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the thematic resonance of "tested faith" could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The glass desert and piano-as-altar are fresh, though the "capriciously consistent" phrasing feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on magic and faith.</comment>
