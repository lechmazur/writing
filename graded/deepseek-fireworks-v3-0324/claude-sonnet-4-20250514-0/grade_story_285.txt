<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's portrayal is compelling, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His transformation is nuanced, though his initial "hesitant swordsman" trait could be more sharply defined early on.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from betrayal to revelation. The hermit crab metaphor drives the narrative elegantly, though the geothermal vents' role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (steam, frozen ground) enhancing the atmosphere. The contrast between frigid tundra and geothermal warmth mirrors Kael's internal conflict perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling craft, with layered symbolism (shells, postcard) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, inviting reflection. Minor quibble: "ephemeral rancor" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The hermit crab metaphor is fresh, and Kael's awkwardness humanizes him. Only flaw: "bridging worlds" theme leans slightly abstract in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished work. The elements serve the story masterfully, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about renewal and legacy.</comment>
