<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's frail physique and internal conflict are vividly rendered, with clear, consistent motivation that drives his transformation. His "voice" is distinct through subtle actions and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the phial’s dilution and bark messages logically escalating tension. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the revolt’s execution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal island setting is inseparable from the theme of shifting loyalties, with sensory details (sour phial, mist) deepening atmosphere. Timeframe and setting amplify the stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (phial as spilled courage, tides as fate) and layered subtext elevate this beyond plot. The ending resonates with thematic weight and emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in Elias’s quiet rebellion. Tropes (prison escape) feel fresh due to nuanced execution. Only minor AI-like phrasing ("painted allegiances" slightly overused).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brief length serves the story’s intensity, leaving a haunting question about the cost of defiance.</comment>
