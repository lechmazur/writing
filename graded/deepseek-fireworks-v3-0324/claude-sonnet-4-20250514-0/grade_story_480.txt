<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and aligned with his role as a social media exorcist, but his indifferent enthusiasm feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions reveal depth, but the "quietly loud" attribute could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The pacing is effective, though the infiltration method feels somewhat rushed and could be better explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the eerie, introspective mood. Sensory details (flickering candle, peeling paint) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's exploration of digital authenticity is thought-provoking, with strong symbolism (the receipt). The ending is purposeful, though the subtext could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept is original and avoids clich√©s. The writing style is fresh, though a few phrases verge on overly poetic ("manufactured authenticity"). Emotional resonance is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving a clear theme. The length is deliberate, leaving room for reflection. However, some connections (like the infiltration method) feel slightly forced.</comment>
