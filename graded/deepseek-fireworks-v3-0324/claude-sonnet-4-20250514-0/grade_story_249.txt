<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus's layered motivations (vigilantism, game collecting) are intriguing but slightly disjointed; the drill as a "calling card" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in the resolution; the barbershop quartet gossip as a catalyst works surprisingly well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative ("city of forgotten fountains"), though the rain metaphor is slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance ("games as resilience"), but the vigilante subplot feels tangential to the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "dust and dreams deferred"), though the drill's symbolism is oddly under-explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements; the whimsical tone elevates it, but the vigilante angle slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
