<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and compelling, her actions align with her "intelligently foolish" nature, and her shapeshifting ability is well-integrated into her character. The broken figurine serves as a strong symbolic anchor for her fractured purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and effectively driven by Zara's plan. The pacing is tight, though the climax (Council members' transformation) feels slightly rushed. The resolution ties back neatly to the figurine motif.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sound, light) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the thematic tension between control and chaos. The taxi ride is inventive but slightly dissonant with the caves' mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (figurine, caves' song) and subtext (power, transformation). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional impact could be deeper. The theme of rebellion through revelation is well-executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("measured wildness," caves singing). Avoids clichés, and the prose is purposeful. Minor quibble: the taxi feels incongruously modern for the setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brief length feels deliberate. The story lingers on the idea of brokenness as potential. The taxi is the weakest link but doesn’t derail the whole.</comment>
