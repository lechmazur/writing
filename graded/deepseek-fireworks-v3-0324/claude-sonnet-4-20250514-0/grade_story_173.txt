<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in his grandmother's wisdom and his unique ability, but his 'wandering orchardist' role feels slightly underdeveloped given the multiverse context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, leveraging the leaf-map concept effectively, though the phantom hand's guidance could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>
