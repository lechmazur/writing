<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mabel's motivation is clear and her "solemnly silly" nature is well-integrated into her actions. Her ghostly caretaker role and the plastic straw reveal a unique, endearing character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a satisfying arc, though slightly rushed in resolution. The forbidden logs and straw perforations logically drive the story forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (auroras, steam) enhance the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (straw as a key), emotional resonance, and a memorable ending. The theme of connection through absurdity is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "perforating fate"). Avoids clich√©s and maintains a consistent, nuanced tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
