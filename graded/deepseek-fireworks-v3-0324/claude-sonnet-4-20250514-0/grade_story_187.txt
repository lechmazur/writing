<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's stoicism and hidden warmth are compelling, though his "brash tenderness" could be more consistently woven into his actions. His lies feel necessary but lack deeper moral conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly paced, with clear cause-and-effect, though the witch's abrupt trust shift slightly strains credibility. The ending's lingering threat elevates it.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive—shadow-familiars and erasing formulas create haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (gnarled fingers, chittering) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong subtext about preservation vs. loss, but dialogue occasionally leans expository. The floorboard as a symbolic artifact is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "mesmerizingly bland strokes"). Only slight stiffness in the witch's dialogue mars otherwise nuanced prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the story feels complete despite brevity. The theme of endangered knowledge lingers powerfully.</comment>
