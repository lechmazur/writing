<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's socially awkward inventor persona is consistent and well-utilized, but his "hopefully cynical" attribute could be more deeply explored. His motivation to overcome regret is clear and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from regret to determination. The encrypted messages and reversed trails logically advance the story, though the diner interruptions slightly disrupt flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like the hum of fluorescent lights and the whistle's smooth surface deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and subtext, particularly in Marcus's regret and redemption. Literary devices (e.g., the whistle as a symbol) are used effectively, and the ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The handling of "forgotten arts" is inventive, though the "reversed trails" method could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the theme. The brief length works in its favor, leaving a lingering impression of legacy and renewal.</comment>
