<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's character is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and eccentric methods that reveal depth. His "apathetic eagerness" is consistent and intriguing, though his "urgings of the soul" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from discovery to purpose. The radio fragments and soil studies drive the narrative logically, though the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The giant's shoe setting is brilliantly evocative, and the harvesting timeframe enhances the urgency. Sensory details (cracked radio, whip's echo) immerse the reader, though more olfactory/tactile cues would heighten the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story excels in subtext (industrial vs. natural agriculture) and literary devices (the whip as metaphor). The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., the whip's moisture detection). No clich√©s, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Ezra's eccentricity feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about ecological stewardship.</comment>
