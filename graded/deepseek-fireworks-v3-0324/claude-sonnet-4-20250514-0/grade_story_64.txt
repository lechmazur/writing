<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her internal conflict about the ethics of immortality could be more deeply explored to elevate her character further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the pacing near the climax feels slightly rushed due to the word limit. Cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered, and its contrast with the dying forest enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (e.g., the "pulsed" scale, carnival colors) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (dragon scale as sacrifice, coded floor as legacy) and emotional weight. The ending resonates, though the judge's verdict could carry more thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but a few phrases ("liquid starlight," "mundane miracles") verge on cliché. The premise avoids tropes, and Elara’s voice feels distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
