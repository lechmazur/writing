<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with clear cunning and moral ambiguity, though his "sudden urge" feels slightly abrupt. His motivation aligns well with his profession, but his shift to destiny-seeking could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the tower's sudden relevance and xerograph's introduction strain plausibility. The ending’s open ambiguity is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout—smoke signals, fluorescent grocery lights, and ancient tech create a rich, evocative contrast. Sensory details (e.g., "wind's gentle chaos") are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seeds as promises) and thematic depth (resurrection vs. exploitation). The prose is polished, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Marcus’s moral ambiguity and the xerograph’s role feel inventive, though the "gentle chaos" motif is slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story’s thematic core, leaving a lingering question about ethical preservation.</comment>
