<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply woven into her actions. Her "solemn absurdity" and defiance against divine beings reveal a nuanced, distinct personality. Her "voice" is strong even in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from ritual to vindication. The postcard method drives the plot logically, and pacing is excellent for the word limit. Cause-and-effect (vanishing postcard → blossom) is deftly handled.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is impeccable—the fog-laden ruin and forge amplify the story’s melancholy whimsy. Sensory details (swirling fog, cold iron) deepen immersion. Setting and object (forge) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evokes profound emotional resonance through symbolism (blossom, postcards) and subtext (defiance as love). Literary devices are fresh and purposeful. The ending is satisfying yet open, lingering in the mind.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés with a unique premise and fresh metaphors ("fog like curious cats"). Nuanced handling of grief and defiance. No AI-generic phrasing or abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion; elements serve the story organically. The length feels intentional, not restrictive. Leaves a haunting question: Can love outlast divine wrath?</comment>
