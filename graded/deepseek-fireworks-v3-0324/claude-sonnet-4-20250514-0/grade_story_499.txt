<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is compelling and sharply defined, with her ghostwriting past and poetic justice arc revealing layered depth. Her actions align with her quiet rebellion, though her internal voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the resolution's reliance on the orchestrated performance feels slightly rushed. Pacing balances urgency and atmosphere well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground orchard and bioluminescent fungi create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere that mirrors Maya's duality. Sensory details (glowing moss, discordant tunes) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: coded poetry as weaponized truth, layered subtext, and a resonant theme of reclamation. Literary devices (symbolism of sandals, fungal light) elevate the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "poetically rational verse") and nuanced handling of secrecy. The journal's fabricated provenance is a brilliant touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about performative justice.</comment>
