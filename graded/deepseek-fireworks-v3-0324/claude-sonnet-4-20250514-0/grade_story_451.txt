<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is compelling, though her hiring actors feels slightly contrived for the plot. Her internal conflict and acceptance of her role are well-executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies heavily on exposition at the climax. Pacing is strong, but the transition from farmers market to mountain feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with "crystal shadows" and the mountain's mystique standing out. Farmers market contrasts effectively with the apocalyptic undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (baseball, shadows) is striking, but the ending's weight feels underexplored. Theme of destiny vs. choice is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists on time travel and apocalypse tropes. Minor clichés in "prophecy" and "hidden cave" hold it back from brilliance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the story's ambition slightly exceeds its word count. Leaves a lingering question about fate’s burden.</comment>
