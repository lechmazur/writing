<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's superstitious nature and connection to her grandmother are well-developed, driving her actions and reactions believably. Her motivation to transcend the physical realm is clear and consistent, though slightly more introspection could deepen her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively within the tight word limit, with the scavenger hunt discovery and submarine descent logically leading to the cave's revelation. Pacing is excellent, though the climax could linger slightly longer for impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with bioluminescent details and sensory-rich descriptions ("salt crystals," "hull groaned") elevating the setting. The cave system feels alive and mythic, perfectly aligned with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., knitting metaphor for creatures) are fresh and purposeful. The ending resonates, though the theme of ancestral wisdom could be more explicitly threaded earlier. Dialogue is sharp and character-revealing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, with no clich√©s and surprising turns (e.g., shifting handwriting). Style is distinct, though a few phrases ("bone-deep certainty") edge toward formulaic. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Minor tweaks could elevate it to flawless.</comment>
