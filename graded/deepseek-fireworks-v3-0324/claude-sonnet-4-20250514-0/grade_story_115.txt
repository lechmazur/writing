<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her guilt and redemption, but her "curious tinkerer" trait could be more vividly integrated into her actions beyond the initial setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from discovery to redemption. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution with Marcus feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city and toxic atmosphere are vividly rendered, with the plague doctor's mask adding a haunting, symbolic layer. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext about guilt and forgiveness, with strong symbolism (mask, wishes). The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper into Elena's remorse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "crystallized regret"). The tone avoids clich√©s, though the "hours of remorse and forgiveness" framing feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere beautifully, with the nano-city and mask elevating the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
