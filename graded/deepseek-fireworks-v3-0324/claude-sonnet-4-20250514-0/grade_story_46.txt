<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's porcelain mask of emptiness and her precise, mechanical actions align well with her role as a guardian, though her "uniquely typical" nature feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with lunar tracking and dream-editing forming a clear cause-effect chain. Pacing is efficient, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of waterfalls, ferns, and piano music creates a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the ring's warmth, Chopin's notes) are sharply evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (plastic ring, moon-paths) and subtext (the fragility of dreams). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into dream-trope familiarity. Language is vivid but occasionally over-precise ("mathematical beauty"). Nuance in Maya's detachment is compelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the storyâ€™s eerie logic. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering unease about the unseen machinery of dreams.</comment>
