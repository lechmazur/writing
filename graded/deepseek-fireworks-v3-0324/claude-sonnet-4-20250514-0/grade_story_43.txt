<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and her introversion contrasts beautifully with the vast, empty setting. The CD's symbolism deepens her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from discovery to revelation, with pacing that balances mystery and payoff. The fireflies' guidance feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the neon cathedral and fog merge dystopia and reverence. Sensory details (LED stained glass, CD prisms) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the theme of fractured beauty. The ending resonates deeply, blending symbolism (mirror, fireflies) with emotional catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though some phrases ("crooked hope") skirt predictability. The CD as a relic feels freshly poignant.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, jewel-like narrative. Every element serves the core theme of courage amid decay. Lingers in the mind.</comment>
