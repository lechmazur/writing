<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her systematically rebellious nature. However, her "elegant chaos" could be more vividly shown through her interactions or internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The star-pattern method is inventive, but the transition from regret to transaction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the tattered scarf and dusty trinkets deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scarf, star charts) and subtext (cultural preservation vs. corporate erasure). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "vibrations of intent" feels slightly forced. The prose is stylish without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers on themes of sacrifice and preservation.</comment>
