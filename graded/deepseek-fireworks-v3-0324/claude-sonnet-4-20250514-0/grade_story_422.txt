<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, her selective mutism and ventriloquism add depth, but her "hopelessly optimistic" trait could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by weather research, but the phone call feels slightly contrived as a dimensional bridge. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about dimensional boundaries and acceptance.</comment>
