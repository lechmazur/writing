<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, though the concept of shared dreams occasionally overshadows the zeppelin setting's role in driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin and 'between radio static' timeframe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (fabric dancing, static crackling) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and subtext, the story excels in symbolism and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful, though the 'chain of letters' motif could be more sharply resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though the 'calm frenzy' tone occasionally feels forced. Avoids clich√©s and demonstrates a distinct style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, leaving a lingering impact. The brevity feels deliberate, and the creative use of shared dreams is compelling.</comment>
