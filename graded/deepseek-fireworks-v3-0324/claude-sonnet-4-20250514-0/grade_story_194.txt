<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's spirited lumberjack persona and gracefully awkward movements create a vivid, distinct character. Her motivation to learn healing traditions is clear, though the transition from lumberjack to healer could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the coded letter and bike rides, but the urgency of future wars feels slightly rushed. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is brilliantly evocative, with sensory details (skull-lined walls, femur chandeliers) enhancing the macabre atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bones as witnesses, spilled wine like blood) and subtext (healing vs. destruction) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("harsh tenderness") and originality in combining elements (lumberjack + ossuary) avoid clich√©s. Minor overuse of "gracefully awkward."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the hidden agenda twist feels slightly abrupt. Creative and cohesive, with lingering thematic weight.</comment>
