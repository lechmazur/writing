<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maya's guilt and motivation are deeply intertwined, revealing a nuanced character arc. Her actions and reactions are consistent with her traumatic past, and her "voice" is distinct, though slightly more introspection could enhance her depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent, balancing revelation and action within the word limit. The resolution feels earned, though the diary's discovery could be foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom is vividly rendered, with sensory details that amplify the atmosphere. The setting reinforces Maya's isolation and the story's themes of grief and redemption. A rare flaw: the "barnacle-encrusted" coffee preparation slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with potent symbolism (the ring, blanket) and emotional resonance. The ending is both satisfying and thematically rich. Minor quibble: the "manic clarity" tone could be more sustained earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The crocheted diary concept is strikingly inventive. Nuanced handling of emotion and subtle subtext elevate the prose. Only a hint of over-formality in phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative where every element serves the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. The thematic depth transcends the constraints.</comment>
