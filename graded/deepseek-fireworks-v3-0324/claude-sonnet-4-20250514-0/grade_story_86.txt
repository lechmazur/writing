<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira's apprehension is clear and drives her actions, though her cybernetic archer background feels underutilized. Her motivation to uncover truth is strong but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the balloon festival refugee feels contrived as a catalyst. Pacing is tight but some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center and "borrowed dawn" tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (candle, breath clouds) enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, balloons) and layered themes (truth vs. deception). Ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of cyberpunk and mythic tones. Some phrases verge on ornate ("chrome cathedral"), but metaphors feel fresh overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the archer motif feels tangential. Leaves a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
