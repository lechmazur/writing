<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, her defiance against oppression well-articulated. Her voice is distinct, though some nuance in emotional depth could elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the cosmic echoes could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the mirror maze and orchard cat adding atmospheric depth. Sensory details are evocative, though the "cosmic echoes" slightly clash with the grounded setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rope, mirrors) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the cosmic echoes feel underutilized for emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors. Some phrasing edges toward flowery, but the theme and style are cohesive and inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven seamlessly into a compelling whole. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, and leaves a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
