<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miranda's motivation is clear and consistent, though her "diabolically benevolent" nature could be more deeply explored. Her actions align well with her spy persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a logical cause-and-effect chain. The time reversal concept is integrated smoothly, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of espionage and fantasy tropes. The writing avoids clich√©s, though Miranda's internal logic occasionally feels overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, though some themes could be deepened.</comment>
