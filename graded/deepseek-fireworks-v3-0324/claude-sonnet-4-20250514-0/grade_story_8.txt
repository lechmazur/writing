<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lord Ashworth's motivation is clear and compelling, blending academic rebellion with mystical pursuit. His actions align well with his empirically rebellious nature, and his distinct voice shines through the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from discovery to transformation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical and impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (sound garden's melodies, chalk scraping stone) enhancing the ethereal yet grounded atmosphere. The tone complements the cosmic-mathematical theme perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craftsmanship, using symbolism (chalk as both tool and prayer) and layered subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of logic-madness duality lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is poetic yet precise, and emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The narrative leaves a lasting impression of intellectual and spiritual daring.</comment>
