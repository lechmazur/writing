<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara's detachment and clinical curiosity are well-defined, but her "zany" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than listed contraptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically, with time-folding and call logs driving discovery. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes the thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subway tunnels and temporal distortion create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked tiles, copper wires) deepen the mood without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext about societal dismissal of artistry. Symbolism (broken case = flawed perceptions) is potent. Ending resonates with quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("time bleeding like watercolors"), no clichés. Emotional nuance in Zara’s detached analysis of judgments. Original voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize brilliantly. The length feels intentional, leaving room for contemplation. Lingering questions about beauty and rejection.</comment>
