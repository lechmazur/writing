<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's layered motivation (defiance, grief, survival) is vividly portrayed, though his "slapdash" nature could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite pacing and taut cause-effect logic, with the cliff's instability mirroring the family's precarious defiance. Minor quibble: the hourglass motif feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The tectonic edge setting is visceral and thematically resonantâ€”every sensory detail (crumpling stone, starlight bread) deepens the story's haunting beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (doorplate as gateway), aching subtext (love vs. mortality), and a devastatingly perfect ending. Only lacks a touch more ambiguity to reach perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("bread that tasted of his grandfather's last laugh") and a daring premise, though the "bard" archetype slightly leans on tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements; the tectonic picnic motif alone justifies publication. Only the hourglass reset feels marginally decorative.</comment>
