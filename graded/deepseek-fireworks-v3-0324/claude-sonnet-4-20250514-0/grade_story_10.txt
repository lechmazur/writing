<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and ghostly server hum create a haunting, evocative backdrop that amplifies Marcus's isolation and the theme of forgotten connections. Sensory details like the rattling chest and crumbling pages enrich immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, using symbolism (the cookbook, the chest) and subtext (perfection vs. vulnerability). The prose is lyrical without being overwrought, and the ending resonates.</comment>
