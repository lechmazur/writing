<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from a sullen farmer to a "cartographer of dreams" is compelling and well-supported by his backstory. His motivation—escaping dead-end fields—is clear, but his sudden zest could benefit from more gradual development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot elegantly connects Marcus's mundane life to the fantastical underwater discovery, maintaining coherence despite the tight word limit. The pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent algae and corroded turbines creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., quilt glowing under organic light) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as portals, quilt as map) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the leap from despair to inspiration could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "patches erasing boundaries") and original world-building avoid clichés. The emotional resonance is genuine, though the "borrowed valor" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's brevity feels intentional, with elements seamlessly integrated. It lingers in the mind, though the fantastical resolution might polarize readers seeking grounded realism.</comment>
