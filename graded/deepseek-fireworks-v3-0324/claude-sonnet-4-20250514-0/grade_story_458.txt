<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, anchored by her father's legacy. Her "spiritually secular" worldview adds nuance, and her final decision feels earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly focused around a pivotal choice, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is strong, though the coffee-stain prophecy borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, echoes, cracked tiles) amplifying the melancholy. The stars' final imagery is transcendent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (button, stains as constellations). The ending resonates with thematic weight, and the prose is lyrical without veering into purple.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "mathematical poetry"). Minor quibble: "fractal sorrow" feels slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically into a poignant meditation on memory and storytelling. The brevity serves the narrativeâ€™s intensity.</comment>
