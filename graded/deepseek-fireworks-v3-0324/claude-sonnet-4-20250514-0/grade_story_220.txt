<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's aloofness and obsession with archives are well-established, but his sudden shift to purpose feels slightly abrupt. Rosa's introduction adds depth, but her backstory could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elena's logbook, but the resolution feels rushed. The strike's role as a catalyst is clear, though the chance meeting with Rosa could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port city and wounded season create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details like rust-streaked containers and echoing footsteps enhance immersion, though some descriptions verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (logbook as truth) and evokes tension, but the ending lacks emotional punch. Dialogue is purposeful, and the theme of buried truth is clear but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the maritime conspiracy angle, but phrases like "innovative nostalgia" feel forced. Some tropes (whistleblower, corporate cover-up) are handled well but not subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and leverages its elements thoughtfully, though the brevity limits deeper exploration. It leaves a lingering question about power but could resonate more.</comment>
