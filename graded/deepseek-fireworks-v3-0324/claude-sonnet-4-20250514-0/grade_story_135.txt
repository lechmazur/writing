<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a richly evocative atmosphere. Sensory details enhance immersion, though more tactile elements (cold, metal) could heighten the mood further.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bruises as a map) and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful and resonant, though a touch more emotional nuance in Magnus's reactions would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors. The premise avoids clich√©s, though some phrasing edges toward slight formality. The voice is distinct and memorable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
