<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Meredith's guilt and motivation are vividly portrayed, with her past and present actions aligning seamlessly. Her decision to redeem herself feels earned, not forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot moves organically from Meredith's routine to her pivotal choice, with tight cause-and-effect logic. The word limit is used economically without sacrificing arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "witch's chamber" setting is evocatively atmospheric, reinforcing Meredith's isolation and moral ambiguity. Sensory details (dusty light, chipped bowl) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bowl as guilt/hope), layered subtext (eulogies as confessions), and a resonant ending. The prose is both precise and lyrical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("vessel of guilt"). Avoids clich√©s; emotions are shown through nuanced actions (trembling fingers, steady voice call).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where every element serves the theme of redemption. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
