<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his desperation driving the narrative. His interactions with the candle mold reveal depth, though his "naive" trait could be more subtly woven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the midnight lecture and tidal surge creating a logical arc. The tight word limit is used effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (candlelight, humming turbines) enhancing mood. The tidal station and candlelit dinner are meaningfully connected, grounding the story’s mystical undertones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle mold as hope) and subtext (bargains with nature). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of surrender to deeper wisdom resonates powerfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The candle mold’s emotional weight and Kellerman’s madness feel fresh, though some phrasing ("wild eyes gleaming") edges toward predictability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of wisdom.</comment>
