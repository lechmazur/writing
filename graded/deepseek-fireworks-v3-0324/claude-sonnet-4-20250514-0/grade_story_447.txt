<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Meredith's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "dutifully defiant" nature shining through. The stuffed toy ear adds a poignant layer to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the amber's deterioration driving the narrative. The cause-and-effect chain is logical, and pacing is well-managed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "amber prison" and mystical atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tone. Sensory details (smell of burnt pie, golden dust) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., the amber as both prison and conduit). The theme of preventing tragedy through subtle intervention is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with minimal clich√©s. The stuffed ear as a conduit for future news is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive and impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
