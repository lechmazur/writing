<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from thug to seeker of redemption is compelling and well-motivated. His actions align with his rational subjectivity and desperation for resilience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the crate slat serving as a strong symbolic thread connecting past and present. The accidental meetings feel slightly contrived but serve the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly rendered, its crackling energy mirroring Marcus's internal tension. Sensory details immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong literary craft—symbolism (slat as measurement of growth), subtext (resilience as active transformation). Ending is satisfying, though slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases ("humming metal sculptures") flirt with over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements interlock well, and the length feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of redemption.</comment>
