<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "measured diplomat" trait feels underutilized. His abrasive calm and methodical revenge are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the quest, but the connection between the theater and genetic patterns feels slightly forced. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with vivid sensory details (dust, drum circles), but the "forgotten city hall" setting could be more integral to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tassel, theater) and subtext (revenge as erasure). Ending is purposeful, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (organically synthetic fibers humming). Avoids clich√©s, but the "diplomat" role feels incongruous.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements (drum circles, diplomat) feel decorative rather than essential. Leaves a lingering question about revenge's cost.</comment>
