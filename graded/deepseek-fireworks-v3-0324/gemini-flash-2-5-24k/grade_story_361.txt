<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's dual nature as a trapper and tech-savvy guardian is compelling, but his "mild-mannered" trait feels underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, but the transition from diner to schoolhouse is abrupt. The dice-as-key concept elevates the structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic atmosphere is vividly rendered, though the diner setting feels underutilized compared to the schoolhouse's rich detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending tech and tradition, though some phrases ("silicon forest") verge on clich√©. Emotional resonance is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The brevity serves its purpose, but the ending lacks a definitive punch.</comment>
