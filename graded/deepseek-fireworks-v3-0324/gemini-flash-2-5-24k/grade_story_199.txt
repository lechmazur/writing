<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's obsessive motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but his 'overzealous' nature could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by chance encounters, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending feels purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly evocative and enhances the story's eerie, liminal atmosphere. Sensory details like the "pale, dreamless sky" are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the notebook, the echo) are well-used, and the theme of searching for the divine in desolation is compelling. The ending lingers but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors ("chasing a memory he never had"). Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story leaves a lingering sense of yearning.</comment>
