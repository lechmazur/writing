<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The careful poisoner's paradoxical nature ("innocently guilty") is compelling, but their motivation ("testing gravity's edge") feels abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is coherent, but the pacing falters slightly in the middle. The ending resolves cleanly, though the experiment's stakes remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, almond scent) enhancing tension. The skateboarding contrast is underutilized but intriguing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier, vial) and subtext (fragility vs. control). The ending lingers, though the emotional resonance is muted by the poisoner's detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("dusty starlight"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "code of instinct" feels slightly forced as a guiding principle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the scavenger hunt mechanic slightly overshadows character depth. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
