<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sneering envoy's motivation is grand yet absurd, and his actions align well with his disdainful, ambitious nature. His "furiously tranquil" state adds depth, though his sneer feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the search for the folded note driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the ending delivers a satisfying payoff within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The domed vineyard and alien plain create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (decay, alien life) enhance the mood and support the envoy's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) and a memorable theme of cosmic ambition. The ending is purposeful, and the writing style elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "cup starlight" motivation and "rambling destiny" tone feel unique, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story rather than feeling forced. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
