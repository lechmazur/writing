<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is clear and consistent, blending hope with desperation. His cleverly naive intuition and emotional depth are well-integrated, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden and its atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (jigsaw edge) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism, imagery) and a resonant theme elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional peak could linger longer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of possibility, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
