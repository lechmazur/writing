<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's headstrong nature and merry bitterness are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and motivations consistently. Her distinct voice and the alignment of her actions with her longing for color are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The connection between the stained glass box and the spell is logical, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "sickly glow of the twin moons" enhance the mood and support Elara's defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stained glass box, glitter) and subtext (confession as liberation). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The feminization of dust storms via glitter is inventive, and the tone balances bitterness with whimsy. Minor overuse of "merry bitterness."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the power of vulnerability.</comment>
