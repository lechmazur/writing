<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his surly demeanor and cosmic quest. His actions and "serenely frantic" energy reveal a complex, distinct character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's riddle-solving, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The graveyard setting and "between seasons" timeframe are evocatively rendered, enhancing the story's eerie, liminal atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (yarn as compass, graveyard as ledger) and a unique blend of mysticism and market logic create depth. The ending lingers, though the conflict is subtle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("dignified chaos") verge on over-polished. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question about cosmic economics. Minor stylistic excesses.</comment>
