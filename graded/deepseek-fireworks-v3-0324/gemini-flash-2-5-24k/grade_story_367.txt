<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "sapped herbalist" background feels underutilized. His obsession with tides is compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The goose method is unique but slightly disrupts logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The observatory and ocean are perfectly matched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bellows, goose) and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of obsession is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The goose metaphor is fresh, though the "price of perfection" theme borders on familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the herbalist element feels tacked on. The story lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
