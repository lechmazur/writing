<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending scientific rigor with whimsy. Her reaction to mortality reveals depth, but her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her actions, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The suspended palace and stalactites create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (brass thermometer, clockwork whirring) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sculpting data, fortune-tellers) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The handling of mortality is nuanced but could feel more human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about legacy.</comment>
