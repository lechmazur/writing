<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intriguing, but her "social media exorcist" role feels slightly underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her curiosity-driven nature, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's quest, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The connection between the receipt and the clubs could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details enhancing the decayed setting. The abandoned mess hall and music hall work well together, though the timeframe's impact is subtle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the receipt as a ghost) are effective, and the story prompts reflection. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. However, the "social media exorcist" concept risks feeling gimmicky without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, leaving a lingering thought. The brevity feels deliberate, though some ideas could be expanded.</comment>
