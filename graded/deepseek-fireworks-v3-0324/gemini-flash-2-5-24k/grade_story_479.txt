<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and profound, aligning well with her glamorous yet solemn profession. Her distinct voice and actions reveal depth, though her "fruitlessly patient" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action of "elongating" digital echoes, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting of a "social network archive" is evocatively juxtaposed with ancient practices, creating a rich atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the brass tape's coolness) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the tape, metaphor of "digital ghosts") are effective, and the theme of legacy resonates. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional payoff could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its blending of digital and funerary traditions. Avoids clich√©s, though the "jubilant remorse" tone occasionally feels overstated. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite multiple assigned elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on memory and legacy.</comment>
