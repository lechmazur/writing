<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with astral projection and survival skills deeply integrated into actions. However, "unyielding compassion" feels slightly forced as a driving trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with fleeing as a strong driver. Pacing is excellent, though the shadow-tracking method could be more logically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered and enhances tension. Sensory details (rust, wind, sun shadows) are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key, shadows) and evocative prose. Ending is abrupt but purposeful. Theme of preservation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "sometimes always" feels contrived. Avoids clich√©s but leans slightly into genre tropes (hunted protagonist).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but "unyielding compassion" and "practiced spontaneity" tone slightly disrupt cohesion. Story lingers despite brevity.</comment>
