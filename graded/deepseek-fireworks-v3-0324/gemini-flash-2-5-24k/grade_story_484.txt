<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brewer's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his craft with existential defiance. His "uniquely generic" nature is a strength, but his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the discoloration, though the protest backdrop feels underutilized. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with strong sensory details. The graveyard and mansion enhance the encroaching darkness, though the protest's auditory contrast is faint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (mirror, fermentation) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict resolution could feel less abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in its mundane-meets-mystical approach. Avoids clich√©s, though "flippant solemnity" wobbles between tone and execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about small acts of defiance.</comment>
