<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's impassive demeanor contrasts sharply with his profound motivation, creating a compelling tension. His actions and method reveal depth, though his 'voice' remains somewhat muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kaelen's quest, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (blossoms, hive hum) enhancing atmosphere. The cathedral-orchard juxtaposition elevates the story's mood and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the twist tie, bee language) are fresh and purposeful. The ending is subtle but resonant, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the bees' language and grace-seeking premise. Nuanced emotion avoids clich√©, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the twist tie and orchard serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about grace.</comment>
