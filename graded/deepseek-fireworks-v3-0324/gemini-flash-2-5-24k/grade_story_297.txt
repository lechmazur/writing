<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her mystical profession and ancestral roots, but her rebellious nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's ritual, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the transition from doubt to resolve. The arc is clear but could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (shimmering ink, hum of the coffee shop) enhancing the mystical tone. The setting, however, feels underutilized beyond ambiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bone, ink) and subtext about reclaiming tradition. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper with more nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases ("professionally rebellious") verge on overstatement. The theme is fresh and thoughtfully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery and purpose.</comment>
