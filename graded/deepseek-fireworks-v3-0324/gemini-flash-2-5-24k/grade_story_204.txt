<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her profession as a cuddler adds depth to her defiance against prejudice. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the farmer's market encounter feels slightly rushed. The phantom punch drives the plot effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar and its decay create a vivid, evocative atmosphere that enhances the story's themes. Sensory details are used sparingly but effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (phantom punch, decay) is strong, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional resonance could be deeper, and the theme, while clear, isn't groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases ("ancient novelty") feel slightly overworked. The handling of emotion is nuanced but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. It leaves a lingering thought but doesn't fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
