<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and consistent, with his unconventional method revealing depth. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., petrichor, stale cake) enhancing mood and immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are effective, and the theme of cosmic justice is compelling. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the seer's olfactory method and the mythic relic premise. No clich√©s, though some phrases border on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about justice's absurd paths.</comment>
