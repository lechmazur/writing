<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaito's transformation from violence to peace is compelling, but his backstory as a "gaijin former lawman" feels slightly underdeveloped for such a nuanced arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the letter and spectacles serving as elegant catalysts. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the castle and spring rains creating a haunting contrast to Kaito's inner turmoil. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spectacles, seeds) and lyrical prose ("corroded rapture") deepen the narrative. The theme of redemption is poignant but risks overtness in the note's message.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "corroded rapture" repeats awkwardly. The spectacles' symbolism feels fresh, but the "cycle of violence" motif borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant vignette. The brevity serves its meditative tone, though some elements (e.g., the boy's delivery) could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
