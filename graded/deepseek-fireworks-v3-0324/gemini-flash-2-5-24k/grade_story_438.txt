<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "vague mystic" trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her drive to chronicle histories, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's action, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships feeling abrupt. The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>
