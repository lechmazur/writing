<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's sullenness and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his connection to the stamps and quilt revealing depth. His shift from despair to inspiration feels organic, though his "borrowed valor" could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the quilt's symbolism driving the narrative forward logically. The word limit is used effectively, though the resolution could linger slightly longer for emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater setting is immersive and thematically resonant, with bioluminescent fungi and algae tanks adding texture. The power station's oppressive atmosphere amplifies Elias's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as fragmented hope, quilt as resilience) elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "borrowed valor" theme could be more subtly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The patchwork metaphor is fresh, and the emotional resonance is earned through nuanced details, not stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the sustainability of Elias's hope.</comment>
