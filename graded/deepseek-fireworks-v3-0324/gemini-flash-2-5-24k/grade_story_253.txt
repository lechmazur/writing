<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his past and present seamlessly. His "eloquently silent" nature and physical limitation add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the chip's unlocking, though the harp method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with vivid sensory details. The refuge's electronic decay enhances the story's mood and stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (harp, chip) and subtext (betrayal, time). Ending is purposeful, though the harp's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The bandit's voice and the harp's dissonance stand out as inventive choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the chip and time motif central. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question.</comment>
