<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's "loudly introverted" nature is vividly portrayed, and their motivation to find courage is clear and consistent. The damaged CD serves as a strong symbolic anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from searching to realization. The firefly method is unique but slightly underdeveloped in driving the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and fog create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (fireflies, CD hum) enhance the mood and align with the character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (CD, fireflies) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of courage could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "crooked hope" tone and damaged CD metaphor feel fresh, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering resonance, though the firefly method could be more pivotal.</comment>
