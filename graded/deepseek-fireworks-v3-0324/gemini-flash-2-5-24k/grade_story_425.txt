<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's morose demeanor and flicker of bored excitement are well-integrated into his actions and reactions, revealing depth. His motivation to restore ancient systems is clear and drives the plot, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the anomaly's confinement, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight but effective, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt given the cosmic stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lavishly austere observatory and starless void create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (emergency light, needle's shimmer) enhance the mood and align with the decay theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (needle as temporal tool) and subtext (decay vs. mending). The ending is purposeful but could evoke deeper emotional resonance. Style supports the story's weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The needle's role is inventive, and the tone avoids predictability. Nuanced handling of Kaelen's gloom and fleeting excitement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the needle and anomaly serving the theme of decay. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on cosmic futility.</comment>
