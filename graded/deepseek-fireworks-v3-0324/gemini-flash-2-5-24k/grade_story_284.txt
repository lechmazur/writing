<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's stoic yet vulnerable transformation is compelling, though his initial "pompous humility" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's simplicity belies its depth; the wallet return as a catalyst for emotional revelation is elegant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The beekeeper's sanctuary is vividly rendered, its tranquility amplifying Silas's internal disruption. Sensory details (buzz, paper plane) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (paper plane as vulnerability) and subtext. The ending lingers with quiet power, though the gasp moment could feel less abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The beekeeper's knowing smile and the paper plane’s childlike sincerity feel fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant vignette. The brevity serves the story’s emotional punch, though the "band stops playing" hook feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
