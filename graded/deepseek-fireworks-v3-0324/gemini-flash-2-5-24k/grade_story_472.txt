<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "renegade" aspect feels underexplored. Her melancholic grace and dedication are well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle. The button's role as a catalyst is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating library and zeppelin setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's cosmic melancholy. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's thematic depth and use of symbolism (button, data streams) are strong, but the ending lacks a definitive punch. The prose is elegant but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases verge on clich√© ("cosmic tapestry"). The concept of matching cosmic puzzle pieces is fresh and intriguing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. It lingers in the mind but could benefit from sharper resolution.</comment>
