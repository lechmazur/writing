<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her unpredictable nature, but her "scrappy tavern-hand" background feels underutilized in shaping her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her ritual, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the connection between her method and the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden and reversed time are vividly rendered, creating a haunting atmosphere that enhances Elara's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's thematic punch could be sharper. The prose is evocative but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The seashells and fossilized footprints are particularly inventive, though the "flippant solemnity" tone wobbles.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts beg deeper exploration.</comment>
