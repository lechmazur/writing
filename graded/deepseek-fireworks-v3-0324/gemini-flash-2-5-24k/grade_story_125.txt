<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's underachieving nature and quiet desperation are well-conveyed, but his "exceptional usualness" could be more deeply explored to justify his motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the misdelivered packages and doll head serving as effective, if quirky, plot drivers. The ending feels purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland boundary create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, blinking eyes, hum) enhance immersion, though the farmland's relevance could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in subtext (mediocrity vs. hidden potential) and literary craft, but the emotional resonance is muted by Kaelen's detached tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The doll head and misdelivered packages are inventive, though the "reclaiming heritage" concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering question about Kaelen's potential, but the farmland subplot feels tangential.</comment>
