<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's internal conflict and quiet transformation are well-developed, though his "openly private" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ladle's discovery and its effects driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the giant's dining room feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (dust motes, ladle's texture) enhancing the mood. The setting contrasts beautifully with the minstrel's mundane life.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ladle as a key, silence as affirmation) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The meteorite texture and ladle's role are inventive, though the "gentle turmoil" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished piece where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of renewal and purpose.</comment>
