<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's ruthless efficiency and unsettling politeness are vividly portrayed, but her transition to ancient stones feels slightly abrupt. Her motivation is clear, but the duality could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the road trip and stone circle visit logically connected. Pacing is excellent, though the final revelation could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (bruised sky, radio static) enhancing the ancient energy of the stone circle. The setting and tone are perfectly aligned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (comb, radio) and a haunting ending. The theme of hidden knowledge is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The comb as a pointer and the "polite anarchy" tone are fresh and memorable. Nuanced handling of emotion and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering sense of unease and curiosity.</comment>
