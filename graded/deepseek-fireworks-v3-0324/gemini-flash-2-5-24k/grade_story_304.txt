<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and poetic, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. The paint-splattered lens adds depth, but his assassin role could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tense, but the spider's web method feels forced. The bus arrival is effective, though the climax is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, but the setting's connection to the bus is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., dawn symbolism) are well-used, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of light vs. darkness is compelling but slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "unforgiving road" concept feels generic. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally drifts into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylish, but some elements (spider's web, bus) feel contrived. The brevity works, though the story could benefit from more subtlety.</comment>
