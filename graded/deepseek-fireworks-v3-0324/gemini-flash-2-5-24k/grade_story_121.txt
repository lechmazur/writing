<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with their unconventional method, revealing a complex, desperate personality. Their "voice" is distinct, though slightly overshadowed by the dense prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the character's quest, but the surreal circus caravans feel underdeveloped as a method. The resolution is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in theater and eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., "cracked asphalt," "impossible colors") are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional depth elevate the narrative, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending resonates, but the theme of "mineralizing chaos" could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. The surreal premise is balanced by grounded character stakes.</comment>
