<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and compelling, with a distinct voice and consistent actions. The "grim sentinel" role is well-integrated, though some nuance in emotional depth could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The method of escape via coin melodies is inventive and drives the narrative forward without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is vividly rendered, with sensory details that enhance the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe ("between shows") amplify the story's tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of simulated reality vs. memory resonates deeply. Writing style elevates the impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The coin-melody method and "weight of remembering" concept feel fresh. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about reality and escape.</comment>
