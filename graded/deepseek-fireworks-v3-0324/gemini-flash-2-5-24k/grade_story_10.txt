<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his past and transformation. The "cheerless duelist" archetype is subverted effectively through his method of emotional alchemy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the "recipes" serving as a coherent device to explore his regrets. Pacing is deliberate but not rushed, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant—abandoned spaceport mirrors his isolation. Server hum adds eerie permanence to his unchangeable past.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "emotional alchemy") and symbolism (chest as emotional baggage). Ending lingers with quiet poignancy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise—no tropes here. "Recipes as coded regrets" is a fresh, specific metaphor. Prose avoids cliché while remaining purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
