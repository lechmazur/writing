<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's naive gambler persona and motivation are vividly portrayed, with her actions and thoughts aligning well with her traits. Her distinct voice and the influence of her unconventional education add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her symbolic act, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect relationships are clear, but the pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal power station and candlelit dinner setting create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (salt, wind, wax) immerse the reader, and the setting reinforces her defiance against oblivion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle as defiance) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be sharper. Literary devices enhance the theme of cosmic defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The professors' chaotic lectures and Elara's nuanced reactions feel fresh. Language is purposeful, with minimal purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brief length works, leaving a lingering question about defiance in the face of inevitability.</comment>
