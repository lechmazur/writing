<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the feather's patterns and flight logs creating a logical, compelling arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the conspiracy's full scope could benefit from slightly more elaboration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility is an inventive setting, but its connection to the peacock feather feels tenuous. Sensory details (e.g., the feather's iridescence) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism and subtext, with the feather and seal enriching the narrative. The ending is satisfying, and the writing style enhances the dark, intricate tone.</comment>
