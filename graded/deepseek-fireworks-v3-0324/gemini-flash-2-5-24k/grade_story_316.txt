<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's timid yet determined nature is well-developed, and her motivation is clear, though her "seraphic" quality feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the scoreboard method, but the resolution feels somewhat rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, blending decay and hope, though the Greek temple's connection to the industrial setting could be stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but the story could benefit from deeper exploration of the town's fractures.</comment>
