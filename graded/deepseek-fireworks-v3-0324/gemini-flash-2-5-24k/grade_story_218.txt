<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's reclusive nature and motivation to escape his self-imposed solitude are clear and compelling, though his "shadowboxing" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the ticket's discovery, but the improv show backstory feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The clock tower and phantom ticket create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, shimmering light) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ticket as escape) and subtext (belonging vs. isolation) are rich, but the ending's emotional punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clichés. The "metaphysically physical" object and near-distance tone feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the improv show feels tangential. The brevity serves the story’s introspective focus.</comment>
