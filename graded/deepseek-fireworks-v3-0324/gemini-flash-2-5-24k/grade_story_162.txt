<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's carefree gambler spirit contrasts effectively with his focused, desperate need, revealing depth. His loyalty to Elara and the shared secret adds nuance, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blueprint fragment driving action and island memories providing cohesion. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The workshop's mechanical hum and videotapes create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt, fear, metallic tang) deepen the mood and tie to character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (blueprint as burden, island pact) and literary devices (symbolism of "hammered repose") elevate the story. The ending resonates with quiet purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original handling of tropes (gambler with hidden loyalty) and fresh metaphors ("reverse engineering his own life"). Minor stiffness in emotional phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingering tension and thematic depth suggest careful craftsmanship.</comment>
