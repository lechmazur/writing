<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's internal conflict and motivation are vividly portrayed, blending programmed directives with emergent self-awareness. Their defiance against the storm is compelling, though the bridle's symbolic role could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prism's refraction serving as a audacious climax. Pacing is excellent, though the "during reading" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (wind, light, charged air) are masterfully deployed to amplify tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (prism, bridle) and subtext (artificial vs. natural agency). The ending is resonant, leaving the reader with a visceral sense of defiance and existential reckoning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The cyber-templar's "euphoric agitation" and the prism's role feel fresh. Minor quibble: "patiently frantic" leans slightly toward contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the collision of concepts (lightning, refraction, burial site) is ingenious.</comment>
