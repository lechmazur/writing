<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her defection and empathy-driven purpose well-integrated. Her "uncertainly certain" conviction adds depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the echo test, but the transition from library to mansion feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could be more definitive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with decaying scrolls and corroded pipes evoking a vivid, haunting mood. The rosebud's symbolism ties elegantly to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (rosebud as empathy, pipes as thresholds) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed. Literary craft is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "fantasy practicality" concept is inventive, though the "colliding destinies" phrasing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about empathy’s role across dimensions.</comment>
