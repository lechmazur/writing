<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and compelling, blending alien purpose with human disguise. Their "fierce tenderness" adds depth, though their alien nature could be more vividly contrasted with their human role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the organ's resonance, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the climax feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (humming stones, organ reverberations) enhancing the mood. The connection between object and setting is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the tile, organ as language) are strong, and the theme of liberation resonates. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the tile and organ serving the story’s core. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting question about humanity’s potential.</comment>
