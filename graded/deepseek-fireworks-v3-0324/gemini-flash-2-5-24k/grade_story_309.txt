<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Detective Corbin's "confidently unsure" attribute is vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "outdance inevitability" feels slightly abstract. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection, slowing momentum. The Queen of Spades as a catalyst works, but the resolution is elusive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gallery setting and "hush" timeframe create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "cheap cologne," "cold card") are sharply evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("kaleidoscope," "molten sarcasm") and subtext, but the ending lacks punch. Style elevates the tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh imagery avoid clichés. The "confidently unsure" paradox and kaleidoscope method feel uniquely human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s brevity leaves thematic depth slightly underdeveloped. Lingers, but not indelibly.</comment>
