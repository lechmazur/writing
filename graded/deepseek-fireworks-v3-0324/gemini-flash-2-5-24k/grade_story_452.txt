<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's softhearted nature and motivation are clear, but his "champion" role feels underdeveloped. The belt buckle symbolism is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts. The planetarium ritual works, but the cyberpunk setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent. Cyberpunk and planetarium clash tonally; sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism. Ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise, but "unraveling fate" feels generic. Nuanced emotion, though some phrasing is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by word count. Elements serve the story, but the cyberpunk setting feels tacked on.</comment>
