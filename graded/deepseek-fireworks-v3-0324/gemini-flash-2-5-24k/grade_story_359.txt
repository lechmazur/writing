<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's absent-mindedness and ironic hope are well-integrated into his character, revealing depth through his sensory retreat and brewing passion. His motivation is clear, though his shift to resolve feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the train station encounter's pivotal role feels somewhat contrived. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nature sound archive and AI-era backdrop are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (brass lion, extinct sounds) enriching the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Elias's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the lion, digital amber metaphor) are effective, and the theme of preserving human craft resonates. The ending is satisfying but leans slightly toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "flicker of compassion" moment borders on predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's theme. Leaves a lingering reflection on human craft in an automated world.</comment>
