<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Aris's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his medical background with an esoteric quest. His desperation and methodical nature are well-conveyed, though his "bleary-eyed" trait could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the coffee-grounds method feels slightly contrived. The cutlass and temple inscriptions are well-linked, though the resolution is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (salt spray, brewing coffee) enhancing the tension. The digital nomad camp feels underutilized compared to the island's mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cutlass as a thread, coffee as prophecy) and subtext (cycles, doom). The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the coffee-grounds trope risks familiarity. The dire enchantment and pirate-temple connection feel fresh. Nuanced emotion and style stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Elements serve the story well, but the digital nomad camp feels tangential. Leaves a haunting question about cycles and fate.</comment>
