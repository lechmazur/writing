<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The herbalist's quiet, deliberate actions and celestial observations create a distinct, nuanced character. Their motivation—subtle communication—is clear and consistent, though slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the meteor shower method feels slightly forced as a plot driver. The flower repositioning is more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The castle setting and distant intimacy tone are evocatively rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (brittle pages, celestial whispers) are particularly strong.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The herbalist's voice and the cosmic-terrestrial duality feel fresh, though some metaphors verge on excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate vignette with lingering emotional resonance. The elements serve the story well, but the meteor showers slightly disrupt focus.</comment>
