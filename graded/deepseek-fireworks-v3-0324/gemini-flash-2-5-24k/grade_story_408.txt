<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is compelling, with clear motivation and a distinct, unsettling presence. His past as a conscientious objector informs his obsessive surveillance, but the "coy malevolence" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, though the tight word limit leaves some connective tissue between his method and motivation implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard and ravine are vividly rendered, with storm-battered resilience mirroring Elias. Sensory details (rusty nails, gnarled branches) deepen the eerie atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nails as data points) and subtext (control vs. observation). The ending lingers, but the "malevolence" could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of surveillance and folk tradition feels fresh, though the "valiantly bored" phrasing risks leaning into pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, though the "holiday tradition" thread could be tighter.</comment>
