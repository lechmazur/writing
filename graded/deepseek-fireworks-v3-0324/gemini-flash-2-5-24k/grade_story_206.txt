<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, blending vengeance with a deeper quest for truth. Her "precisely creative" attribute shines in her methodical, artistic revenge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's psychological counterattack, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of the hidden continent thread.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten market is vividly rendered, with dust motes and shattered skylights enhancing the atmosphere of decay and conflict. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (locket, sugar sculptures) and subtext (moral fulcrum of kindness) enrich the narrative. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The candy sculptor's vendetta and the locket's role feel uniquely integrated, though scorn occasionally overpowers nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, though the hidden continent could use more grounding.</comment>
