<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unusually normal" attribute feels underdeveloped. His con artist background and defiant spirit are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat static. The interrogation of ghosts is intriguing but doesn’t drive the plot forward as effectively as it could.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the oppressive atmosphere. The "story time" frame is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tape dispenser) and subtext, but the ending lacks a definitive punch. The theme of defiance resonates well.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The handling of remorse is nuanced, though the ghostly apparitions verge on trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering thought but could be tighter.</comment>
