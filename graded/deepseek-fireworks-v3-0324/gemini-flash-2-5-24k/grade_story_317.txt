<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's nostalgic yet anxiously fearless nature is well-integrated, driving his actions and lending depth to his resolve. His motivation is clear, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc. The crystal threat and betrayal patterns logically drive the action, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The levitation facility and breaking dawn create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (fizzing sound, tarnished telescope) enhance immersion and tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (telescope as relic, crystals as betrayal) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (crystals fraying reality). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing leans slightly generic ("internal tremor of anxiety").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic weight (cycles of failure, quiet defiance).</comment>
