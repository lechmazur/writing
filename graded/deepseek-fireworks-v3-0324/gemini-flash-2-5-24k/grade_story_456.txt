<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her morbid fascination and tempered beliefs well-integrated into her actions. However, her "boldly timid" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through dialogue or interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her search, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending feels purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, and the setting enhances the story's mood. The floating rock dojo and candle are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a memorable perspective on decay and cycles. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally relies on familiar tropes (e.g., the solitary seeker). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be sharper in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. The length feels intentional, though some thematic depth is hinted at rather than fully explored.</comment>
