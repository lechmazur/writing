<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the method of reconnecting threads could be more concretely tied to the lunar setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the sterile lunar base contrasting beautifully with the ballet shoes' fragility. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's quiet clarity might lack punch for some readers. The theme of grace is explored thoughtfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The ballet shoes as an anchor and the lunar setting feel fresh, though the "rustic refinement" tone is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. Leaves a lingering sense of quiet achievement.</comment>
