<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, and his unique gift for discerning truth adds depth. However, his 'subtle swordsman' trait feels underutilized beyond initial description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's "fleeting moment" could be slightly more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The petrified forest is vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the theme. Sensory details (e.g., "brittle, preserved bark") enhance atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (forest as library, schematic as cosmic principle). The ending is profound and lingers, though the "lucid confusion" refrain borders on overuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "subtle swordsman" archetype feels slightly generic. Emotional resonance is strong, though Kaelen's internal reactions could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The schematic's revelation elevates it beyond a simple quest narrative, leaving a haunting thematic aftertaste.</comment>
