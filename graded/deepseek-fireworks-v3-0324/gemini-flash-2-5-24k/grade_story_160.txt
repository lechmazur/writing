<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clandestine watchman's motivation is clear and compelling, blending analytical detachment with a primal defiance of finality. His use of the goggles and briefcase adds depth, though his 'voice' remains somewhat elusive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the watchman's obsession, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is vividly rendered, with sensory details (grease, decay, the single bulb) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting perfectly mirrors the watchman's futile defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (goggles as "ancient eyes," briefcase as a cipher) and subtext (mechanics vs. rebirth). The ending lingers, though the conflict's scale could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The wilderness wisdom feels slightly forced, but the prose is purposeful, with fresh metaphors ("ghosts of grease").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story's theme. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting question about the limits of defiance.</comment>
