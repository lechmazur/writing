<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's sincerity is clear, but his conjuring aspect feels underexplored. His motivation is consistent but could delve deeper into personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cause-and-effect logic with a satisfying arc. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the sanctuary's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-weary atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the sanctuary's contrast enhancing thematic resonance. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("dysfunctionally functional"). Avoids tropes but occasionally over-relies on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate seamlessly, and the length feels deliberate. Lingering hope lingers effectively, though the conjuring could be more central.</comment>
