<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alistair's mechanical arm and philosophical pursuits create a compelling, distinct character. His motivation is clear, though slightly abstract, but his reactions to the sock and revelation under pressure reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from obsession to revelation. The sock's discovery and Silas's confrontation drive the story effectively, though the ending applause feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (whirring arm, crumbling walls, sea mist) deepen immersion. The sock's presence ties meaningfully to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sock, flaw) and layered themes (perfection vs. chaos). The ending is satisfyingly philosophical. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "conduit of imbalance"). Avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose. Nuanced handling of emotion and subtext. Voice is distinctive and tonally consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on imperfection and dreams. Creative and deeply resonant.</comment>
