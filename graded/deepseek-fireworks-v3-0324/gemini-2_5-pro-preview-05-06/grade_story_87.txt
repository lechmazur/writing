<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her "hyperactively serene" demeanor, though her "patient librarian" trait could be more integrated into her present actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mixtapes driving the emotional arc. Pacing is excellent, though the steampunk setting feels slightly underutilized in the plot's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly rendered, but its connection to Elara's emotional journey could be deeper. Sensory details (e.g., the gramophone's distortion) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (sticker sheet, mixtapes) and subtext. The ending's muted catharsis is poignant and purposeful, though the prose occasionally verges on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The "hollow victory" theme is fresh, though "savage grace" tone sometimes feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant story that leverages its constraints well. The steampunk setting is the only semi-extraneous element.</comment>
