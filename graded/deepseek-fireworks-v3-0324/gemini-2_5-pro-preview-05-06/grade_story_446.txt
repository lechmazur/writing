<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with a clear, layered motivation that drives his actions. His "peaceful anger" and obsession with the ledger reveal depth, though his gambler persona could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect. The tight word limit slightly rushes the revelation of the ledger's secret, but the arc is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and charity drives are evocatively rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere and Elias's introspection. Sensory details are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fireflies, petals) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the central conflict could be more explicitly tensioned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "unbecoming" concept is fresh, though some metaphors verge on over-poetic. Emotional resonance is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the gambler trait could be more integral.</comment>
