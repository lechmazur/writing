<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maeve's motivation is clear and consistent, with her rebellious yet earnest nature compellingly driving her actions. The wilted paper flower serves as a poignant symbol, deepening her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed, with the laundromat encounter and giant's study feeling abrupt. The core conflict—her struggle to unify minds—is compelling but could be more tightly woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout, with the laundromat and giant's study evocatively contrasting mundane and mystical. Sensory details (bleach, forgotten dreams) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending lacks resolution. The writing style is lush but occasionally overwrought, risking purple prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The handling of Maeve's visions and the paper flower's symbolism feels uniquely personal, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though the word limit forces some compression. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of prophetic insight.</comment>
