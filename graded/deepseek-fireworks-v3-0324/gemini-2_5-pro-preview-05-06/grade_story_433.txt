<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's brittle spirit and hardheaded nature are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and reactions consistently. Her motivation to seek solace is clear, though slightly underdeveloped in its transition to inner peace.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from desperation to realization. The connection between the gallery's transience and Elara's journey is subtly effective, though the prophecy's role feels rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the wildflower's symbolism, the theme of acceptance, and the restrained prose evoke deep resonance. The ending is poignant and thematically satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "mosaic of past griefs").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering reflection on brokenness and wholeness.</comment>
