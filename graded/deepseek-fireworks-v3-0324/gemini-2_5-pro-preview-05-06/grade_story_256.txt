<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is compelling and well-articulated, with his 'loyally disloyal' nature adding depth. His actions align perfectly with his yearning for the horizon, though a touch more nuance in his background could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Alistair's ritual, but the tight word limit leaves some connective tissue between the cafe's stasis and his rebellion underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating island cafe and 'soft edges of time' create a vivid, dreamlike atmosphere. Sensory details (cloud-stuff, whipped cream despair) are exquisite and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spoon as divining rod) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The unresolved tension between hope and despair lingers beautifully, though the ending could resonate more sharply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and haunting, with fresh metaphors. Some phrases border on overly ornate ("cotton-candy boundaries"), but the emotional core feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize well, and the brevity feels intentional. The storyâ€™s strength lies in its thematic depth, though the 'soft edges of time' concept could be more tightly woven.</comment>
