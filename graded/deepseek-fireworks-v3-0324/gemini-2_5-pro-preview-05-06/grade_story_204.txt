<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's transformation is subtly and convincingly portrayed, with her professional background and initial prejudice clearly motivating her reactions. Her internal shift feels earned, though her profession could be more tightly integrated into her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from the farmer's market encounter to the hangar's symbolic resolution. Pacing is deft for the word limit, though the "acceptance speech" framing feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned hangar is evoked with vivid sensory details, its decay mirroring Elara's crumbling prejudice. The floral-rust contrast and "cathedral of decay" metaphor are particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The phantom ticket punch as symbolism is masterful, and the subtext about finding beauty in imperfection lingers. Only minor quibble: Kai's community could feel less idealized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("cathedral of decay") and nuanced emotion. The cuddler profession risks gimmickry but ultimately serves the theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the hangar and decay motif resonating most. The length feels intentional, though the farmer's market detour slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
