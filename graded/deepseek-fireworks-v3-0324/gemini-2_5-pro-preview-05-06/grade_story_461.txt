<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair’s sardonic bitterness and reluctant hope are vividly rendered, with his motivations and reactions consistently aligned. His voice is distinct, though his "irate explorer" trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from resistance to tentative resolution. The generational curse concept drives the action effectively, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, blending decay and nostalgia with occult undertones. Sensory details (dusty floorboards, cobweb-like silence) deepen immersion. The pendant’s symbolism is seamlessly tied to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., "uniquely static," "sharp as shattered glass") and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s fragile peace is satisfying, though the thematic depth slightly outweighs the emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh, specific imagery and nuanced emotion avoid clichés. The sardonic tone and thematic originality stand out, though the "irate explorer" framing feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, with the pendant and generational pain central to its impact. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on inherited trauma.</comment>
