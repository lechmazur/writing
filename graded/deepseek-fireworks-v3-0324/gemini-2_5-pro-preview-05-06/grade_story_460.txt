<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's character is richly developed, with his unassuming nature and calloused hands contrasting his royal title. His motivation to cradle wisdom and his tactile decision-making method are consistent and deeply revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with Alaric's dilemma driving the narrative. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the resolution leans slightly on abstract symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The acid rain forest is vividly rendered, with sensory details (tang of corrosion, iridescent feather) enhancing the oppressive yet wondrous atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Alaric's struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent metaphors (puzzle pieces, ember of choice) and subtext about resilience. The ending is purposeful, though the feather's symbolism borders on over-reliance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of post-apocalyptic decay with tactile mysticism. Some phrases ("prickly wonder") verge on repetitive, but the voice avoids clich√© and feels distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, the story integrates elements skillfully. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on hope amid ruin.</comment>
