<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's stubbornness and monk background are well-integrated, driving his obsessive quest. His motivation to outsmart his dark reflection is clear but could use slightly deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with the flute's analysis driving the revelation. The ending twist (reclaiming vs. destroying) elevates the arc, though the gondola's role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is impeccable—pine, ice, and fragile gondola heighten the tension. The setting amplifies Kaelen's isolation and the reflection's menace.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (flute as flawed history) and subtext (purification vs. vengeance). The ending lingers, though the "grim smile" moment slightly telegraphs the resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh take on the doppelgänger trope, with tooth marks as language adding originality. Minor quibble: "cautious enchantment" edges toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. The short length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic resonance without sacrificing logic.</comment>
