<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with self-deception as a compelling driver. The "skillfully incompetent" attribute is subtly woven into actions, but could be more explicitly tied to pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's internal logic holds, but the transition into forgotten dreams feels abrupt. The resolution is strong, though the middle could better justify the method's peril.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric detail; the attic and clockwork animals amplify the theme of fractured identity. The "sculptor's chisel" timing is a standout, resonant touch.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional weight, but some metaphors (e.g., "bruised fighter") verge on cliché. The ending's thematic payoff is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original handling of tropes, though the "self-deception" arc isn't groundbreaking. Language is precise, but occasional phrases feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity serves the story’s intensity, though the dream sequence could be more integrated.</comment>
