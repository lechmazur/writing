<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's cold-natured stoicism contrasts powerfully with his artistic awakening. Motivation is clear, but his shift toward warmth could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses organically from remedy-collecting to artistic purpose. Pacing is tight, but the altars' introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—frost, shadows, and the red mitten create vivid tension. The agent center’s sterility contrasts well with the city’s hidden life.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (mitten, altars) resonates, but the artistic awakening’s execution leans slightly tell-y. Ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "knight in Kevlar"). Minor stumbles in emotional nuance (e.g., "warmer than any he’d known" feels overstated).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere elegantly; the mitten’s role is inspired. Length feels deliberate, though the altars’ significance could be woven earlier.</comment>
