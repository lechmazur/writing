<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's reckless yet meticulous nature is well-developed, and his internal conflict about his promise to Elara adds depth. His motivation is clear, but the shift to vulnerability feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the resolution of Kaelen's epiphany could be more layered. Pacing is effective but leans slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair and misty forest are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly mirrors Kaelen's internal decay and potential rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (camera as judgment, carousel horse as lost joy) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("atomized the promise"). Avoids clich√©s, though the street musicians' advice borders on didactic. Emotion is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and serve the theme of self-reckoning. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about redemption.</comment>
