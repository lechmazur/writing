<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's edgy, pessimistic nature is vividly conveyed and drives his actions, but "edgy tradesman" feels slightly underdeveloped as a descriptor. His motivation is compelling and coherent, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect and a resonant arc. The word limit is masterfully used—no wasted space, yet nothing feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and evocative; the mushroom house and decaying windmill enhance the mood of fragility. Sensory details (mycelium scent, bioluminescence) are standout strengths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich subtext (memory vs. oblivion). Literary devices (symbolism of watches, faded flyer) deepen the narrative. Ending is poignant and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal clichés. The "vectorize" action and synchronized watches method feel fresh. Nuanced emotions ("blurry vividness") avoid AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
