<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bolt's motivation is compelling and consistent, their actions deeply aligned with their purpose. The metallic tenderness adds nuance to their voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly focused, with clear cause-and-effect, though the infinite timeframe slightly undermines tension. Pacing is elegant within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and river of stars create a transcendent, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crystalline fruits, starlight) are masterful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "repulsively attractive" confessions and Bolt’s dual emotion feel fresh. Minor risk of over-poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story’s meditation on silence and witnessing. Length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
