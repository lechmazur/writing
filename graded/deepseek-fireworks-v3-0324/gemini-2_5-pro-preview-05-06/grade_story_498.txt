<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized—his nervousness, control, and internal conflict are sharply drawn. The seeds as a symbol of hidden hope versus his xenophobia adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from stagnation to potential change. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Oakhaven’s frozen isolation is palpable. Sensory details (frost, weak sun) and the Grove’s contrast amplify tension. The setting reinforces theme and character perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful subtext: seeds as rebellion, "tyranny of indifference" dual meaning. The ending’s quiet defiance lingers. Literary devices (symbolism, juxtaposition) are seamless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and nuanced—no clichés. Elias’s shift feels human, not algorithmic. The garden as defiance is fresh, and the prose avoids pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The length feels intentional, and the story resonates beyond its words. Every detail serves the narrative.</comment>
