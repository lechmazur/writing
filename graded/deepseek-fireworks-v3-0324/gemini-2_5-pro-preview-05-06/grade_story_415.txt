<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with clear motivation, though the "taste memories" ability borders on gimmicky. Chef Antoine's internal conflict is well-explored but risks overshadowing his culinary identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but slightly meandering. The "tracking rain trails" method feels abstract, diluting the forward momentum. Resolution is subtle yet satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with exceptional sensory detail (e.g., the paperclip's texture, memory-taste). The stadium setting contrasts poignantly with the valley metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with vivid metaphors ("emotional archaeology"), though some symbolism (yodeling valley) strains under its own weight. Ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s, but the memory-tasting device feels overly contrived. Nuanced emotions balance occasional over-formality ("ruminative exasperation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. The paperclip and stadium elevate the story, but the yodeling valley concept detracts slightly from focus.</comment>
