<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation and personality are vividly rendered, with his "spineless" nature contrasting beautifully against his deep, almost devotional quest to understand flowers. His actions and method are tightly aligned with his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced for the word limit, though the resolution is intentionally ephemeral, leaving a sense of longing rather than closure. The connection between beginning and end is subtle but present.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (rain, decay, salt) immersing the reader. The setting amplifies the story’s melancholy and Alistair’s isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending lingers, and the prose style enhances the emotional weight. A clear, poignant theme emerges.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the writing style feels distinct, with fresh metaphors and purposeful language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively executed. The length feels deliberate, and the elements serve the narrative. It leaves a haunting, reflective impression.</comment>
