<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the action of preserving voicemails driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom hall and dreamless night create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (light, sound, touch) are masterfully used to enhance mood and character tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (prism/cloak) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of self-liberation resonates deeply. Writing style elevates the emotional impact.</comment>
