<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, blending altruism with pragmatism. The child's skeleton key necklace adds depth to his backstory, though his "logically emotional" framework could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the unstable tunnel section feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the climax could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (e.g., jasmine scent, metallic decay). The whispering gallery and lockdown setting enhance tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, subtext) are well-used, and the theme of survival resonates. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the jasmine-scent method and Elias' nuanced morality. Minimal clich√©s, though the "grandiose modesty" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice and redemption.</comment>
