<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the catapult launch serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent, and the story feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and Elara's isolation. Sensory details (salt, ozone) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tablecloth as celestial map) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, and the theme of defiance against time resonates deeply.</comment>
