<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's cunning and morally ambiguous nature is well-developed and drives his actions convincingly. His sudden urge and subsequent discovery feel authentic to his character, though his "gentle chaos" could be more vividly contrasted with his usual rigidity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain from the grocery detour to the tower discovery. Pacing is excellent, though the xerographing could feel slightly abrupt if not for its thematic significance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower and seed packets create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (cobwebs, faded illustrations) deepen immersion, though the grocery setting's transition could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of shifting symbols, botanical immortality) elevate the story. The ending thrills with its promise of power, though the "gentle chaos" tone occasionally clashes with the meticulous prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases ("botanical Rosetta Stone") border on ornate, but the core concept is inventive. Alistair's moral ambiguity adds nuanced humanity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for the reader to imagine Alistair's next steps.</comment>
