<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's guilt and motivation are clear, driving her actions consistently. Her scientific skepticism contrasting with her emotional desperation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the emergency descent feels slightly abrupt. Cause-and-effect is logical, with a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dull radiance, damp earth) amplify the atmosphere. The setting reinforces Elara’s isolation and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (ice violin, Lumina moths). Emotional resonance is achieved, though the ending leans slightly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "silent overture of tomorrow"). Avoids clichés, though "roar of guilt" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce purposefully. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
