<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's weariness and quiet yearning for freedom are vividly portrayed, but his transformation feels slightly underdeveloped given the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from jostle to introspection is cohesive, but the shift from garden to lava lamp room could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric contrast between the "intensely quiet" sanctuary and Alistair’s inner noise is masterfully rendered, though the community garden could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the Queen of Spades, lava lamps) and understated prose elevate the story, though the theme of "breaking free" leans toward the expected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original in execution but occasionally slips into familiar tropes (the world-weary lawman). The quiet tone and sensory details feel organic, not AI-generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant vignette, though the resolution borders on tidy. The lava lamp metaphor is inventive but risks overexplanation.</comment>
