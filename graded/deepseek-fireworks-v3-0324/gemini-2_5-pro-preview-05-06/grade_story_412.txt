<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending intellectualism with fanaticism. His use of the rubber key cover and cyclical nightmares reveal depth, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the infiltration's ease feels slightly contrived. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the climax lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The station’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming corridors, flickering lights) amplifying the tone. The setting and object mesh seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key cover as "silence") and layered themes (destruction/rebirth). The ending is poignant but leans slightly into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "surgeon excising rot"). Minor AI-esque flourishes ("mournful elation") but avoids clichés overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative interplay (bookish assassin + secret keepers). The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering existential weight.</comment>
