<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby's loneliness and dual role as a protector and entertainer are compelling, but his playful dread could be more deeply explored to fully justify his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the artifact's protection driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the zero-gravity method feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The booth's eerie atmosphere is masterfully rendered, and the spectral whispers enhance tension. Sensory details (ozone, incense) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flame as defense) and subtext (loneliness vs. duty), though the ending's wistfulness could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the zero-gravity ritual, but some phrasing ("playful dread") edges toward artifice. Nuanced emotion avoids AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive tale that balances constraints elegantly. Leaves a lingering question: who—or what—will challenge Barnaby next?</comment>
