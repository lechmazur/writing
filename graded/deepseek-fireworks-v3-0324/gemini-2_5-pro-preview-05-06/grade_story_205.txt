<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's fragility and cynicism are well-balanced, driving her mission believably. Her "delicate warrior" persona is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The seaweed-cameo method is creative but risks feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swamp's eerie, firefly-lit atmosphere is vividly rendered and enhances the story's emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (Harmony, laughter) and a resonant ending, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on "forsaken land" tropes. The cynical voice feels fresh, but the seaweed's role is predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the word limit strains the ending's payoff. Leaves a lingering hopefulness.</comment>
