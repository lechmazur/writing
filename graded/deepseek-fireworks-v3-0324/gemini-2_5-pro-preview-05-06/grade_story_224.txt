<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent; her "openly private" nature adds depth, but her actions could show more nuance in alignment with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and well-paced, with a clear arc. The meteorite's role as a catalyst is logical, though the ladle's connection feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with strong sensory details. The giants' dining room amplifies the tension, though "rush hour" could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and subtext elevate the story, but the ladle's magical resolution lacks deeper exploration. The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though the ladle's role borders on tropish. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though some elements (like the ladle) feel underutilized. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of transformation.</comment>
