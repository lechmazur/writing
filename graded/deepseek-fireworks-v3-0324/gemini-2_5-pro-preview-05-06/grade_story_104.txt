<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's stoicism and motivation to defy conformity are clear and consistently aligned with his actions. His reaction to the bird skull cameo reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action of venerating the cameo. The word limit constraints are managed well, though the arc could feel slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting and timeframe are evocatively tied to the story's tone. Sensory details enhance immersion, but some connections (e.g., harvest day) could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of defiance resonates. Minor room for deeper emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Leaves a lingering thought about authenticity. Elements serve the story well, with minor room for tighter integration.</comment>
