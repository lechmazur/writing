<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her actions. Her "quiet deserter" nature and "dizzyingly grounded" state are vividly portrayed, and her arc feels both authentic and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Anya's struggle to her decisive act. The method of carbonizing masks is logical and impactful, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "plant communication study" setting is brilliantly evoked, creating a resonant atmosphere. Sensory details (burnt clay, fractured reflections) deepen immersion and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (mirror, masks) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically rich, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids tropes. The prose is elegant without being ornate, and the emotional depth feels nuanced rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic resonance lingers.</comment>
