<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's "carefully reckless" attribute is well-integrated into his actions, and his motivation is clear and consistent. The amber relic reveals depth about his past, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final reveal of "Begin" slightly overshadows the buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting and "echoing hour" timeframe are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The street artist’s haven contrasts beautifully with Silas's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amber, seraph murals) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt. Theme of new beginnings is subtly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "defiant bloom on decaying stone"). Avoids clichés, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate. Nuanced handling of Silas's trembling hope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Combines elements inventively, leaving a lingering sense of quiet transformation. Minor quibble: "Begin" could feel overly sparse.</comment>
