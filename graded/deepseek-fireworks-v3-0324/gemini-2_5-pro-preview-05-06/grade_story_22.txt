<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is strong and distinct, though her "perfectly flawed" trait could be more deeply integrated into her actions. Her voice is sharp and memorable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tight and driven, with clear cause-effect logic. The pacing balances urgency and deliberation well within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered, but the "portal-strewn canyon" could feel more dynamically alive. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subtext (ambition vs. tradition) resonates, and the ending lingers. Dialogue crackles with purpose, though some metaphors verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh take on tropes, but "harvesting grace" risks abstraction. Avoids AI pitfalls, though tart subplot leans quaint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere elegantly; length feels intentional. Leaves reader pondering legacy’s cost. Minor quibbles don’t undermine impact.</comment>
