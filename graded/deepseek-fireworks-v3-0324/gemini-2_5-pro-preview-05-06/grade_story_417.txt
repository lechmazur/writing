<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thistlewick's fervent zealotry and fragile vulnerability create a compelling, layered character. His motivation is clear, though his playfulness could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent, with a clear cause-and-effect chain (uprooting the vine → confession). Pacing is strong, but the transition from action to reflection feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The jungle's encroachment on the parlor is masterfully atmospheric. Sensory details (humid air, grime, candlelight) immerse the reader, though the timeframe ("during studying") feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottle cap as "navel," jungle as chaos) and a haunting emotional core elevate this. The ending lingers, though the whispered confession could be more thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and vividly strange, avoiding clichés. The prose is lush but purposeful, though some phrases ("fervent light," "verdant maw") edge toward over-decoration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, though the "unspoken agreements" concept could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>
