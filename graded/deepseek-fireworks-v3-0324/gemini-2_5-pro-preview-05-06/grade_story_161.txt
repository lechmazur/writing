<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a logical progression from discovery to revelation. The mosaic demonstration is a striking climax that ties everything together elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hangar setting enhances the story's themes of flight and fragility. Sensory details (cold metal, distant wind tunnel) deepen immersion without overshadowing the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (orchard blight/airplane failures) and subtext (malice disguised as chance). The ending is both satisfying and haunting, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
