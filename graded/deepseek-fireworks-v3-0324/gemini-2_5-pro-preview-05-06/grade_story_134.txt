<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her curiosity-driven, polite yet determined personality. The "obnoxiously polite" attribute adds a distinct layer to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the conflict with the entity, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The laundry cycle's interference is a clever touch but could be better integrated.</comment>
