<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's frailty and desperation are well-conveyed, but her "resolutely wavering" state could be more deeply explored to fully align with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and well-paced, with the Sorting ceremony and escape logically connected. Only minor tightening of the phial's diversion could improve coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal island and painted allegiances create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere, though the "hopeful melancholy" tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the ending's hope feels slightly rushed. The central conflict (escape vs. conformity) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("frantic drum against her ribs") verge on overused. The premise is fresh, though.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length, leaving a lingering question about freedom. The elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
