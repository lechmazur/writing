<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and compelling, though the "desert wanderer" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped in the current context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive and driven by research, but the looming deadline (last apple) could be more urgently threaded through earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the crow's nest and pirate ship offering rich atmospheric contrast to Kael's introspective mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft; themes of love and connection resonate deeply, though the ending could linger more deliberately.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., brass ruler as a measure of connections). Minor risk of "translated love" feeling abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Only the crow's nest setting feels slightly underutilized for thematic payoff.</comment>
