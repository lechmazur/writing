<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her trait as a flighty yet determined cartographer is well-portrayed, though her "serene anger" could be more deeply explored to clarify its impact on her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's method, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with subtle sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The "strangely normal" opulence contrasts effectively with the esoteric society.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering impression of thematic depth.</comment>
