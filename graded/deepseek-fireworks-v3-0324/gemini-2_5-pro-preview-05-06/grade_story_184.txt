<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pip's motivation is clear and intriguing, though his tavern-hand background feels slightly underutilized. His "flippant solemnity" voice is distinct and engaging.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's structure is tight and purposeful, with the randomization method driving a coherent, surreal arc. Pacing excels within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden and dying-star hourglass are brilliantly evocative. Sensory details (cracked mud, phantom winds) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext on time and possibility, with potent symbolism (seashells as "seeds of infinite tomorrows"). Ending resonates philosophically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor quibble: "cosmic itch" verges on purple prose, but the rest feels uniquely crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity amplifies its impact.</comment>
