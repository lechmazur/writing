<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's dutiful yet rebellious nature is well-established, and his alliance with Lyra adds depth. Motivation is clear but could benefit from more internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the drone encounter feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescent flora, cloud-sea). Atmosphere enhances the heist's tension and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fortune cookie as prophecy) and subtext (rebellion vs. duty). Ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "forgotten dance"). Avoids clich√©s, though the alliance trope is somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a thematic resonance about cultural preservation.</comment>
