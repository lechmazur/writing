<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s relentless hunger for forbidden knowledge is vividly portrayed, driving his actions with a clear, consistent motivation. His distinct voice and methodical nature shine through, though his thin-lipped description feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Alistair’s arcane optimization driving the narrative logically. The ending delivers a satisfying payoff, though the connection between the mine and library could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned mine-library is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (ozonic air, grime, cold light) enhancing the eerie mood. The setting profoundly supports Alistair’s obsessive quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose and potent symbolism (the figurehead’s eye) create layers of meaning. The climax thrums with tension, leaving a haunting impression of Alistair’s dangerous certainty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Refreshingly original, avoiding clichés. The "confusing certainty" motif and Alistair’s nuanced obsession elevate it beyond tropes. Minor overuse of adjectives ("worn velvet," "pale green").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate vignette that lingers. Every element serves the story’s thematic depth, though the mine-library connection could be more seamless.</comment>
