<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's hive-mind therapist is vividly portrayed with a distinct, multi-vocal voice, and its motivation to "anchor the ephemeral in reality" is compellingly consistent. The character's reaction to the phone charger plug reveals a melancholic yet pragmatic approach to failure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the wax-dripping method driving the narrative forward logically. The connection between Thorne's regrets and the "blueprint of failure" is clear, achieving a complete arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The secret agent facility's sterile, oppressive atmosphere enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the sizzling wax and the "faint, residual energy" of the plug deepen immersion and align perfectly with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "enlightened necromancy") and symbolism (the wax as regret-data). The ending is chillingly purposeful, leaving a lingering meditation on failure. The writing style elevates the emotional and thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal clich√©s. The hive-mind therapist and wax method are fresh, and emotions are shown through nuanced subtext (e.g., "merry bitterness"). No AI-generated repetitiveness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven into a deliberate, impactful narrative. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers with thematic depth. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
