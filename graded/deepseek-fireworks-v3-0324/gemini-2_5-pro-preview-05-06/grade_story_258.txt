<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's nimble locksmith background subtly informs her precision and methodical approach to piecing together the dances, but her jaded wonder feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the urgency of the final leaf and the discovery of the dance sequence creating clear cause-and-effect momentum. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard and the storm of secrets create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the driftwood's pulse and the shimmering water are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the leaf, the dances as a metaphysical key) and a resonant ending. The "physically metaphysical" energy is a standout literary device.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "jaded wonder" tone occasionally slips into formulaic phrasing. Avoids clich√©s in its handling of the dances' power.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
