<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's dual role as an elevator technician and ghost-seer is compelling, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "elegant clumsiness" and method of staking out ghost tours reveal depth, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the elevator repair framing a poignant internal arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-effect logic (ghost tours → acceptance) is subtle but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's hushed, spectral atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (salty air, brittle petals) enhancing the theme of impermanence. Setting and object (flower crown) are deeply intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flower crown, sandcastles) and subtext. The ending’s quiet resolution is deeply satisfying, and the theme of shared fragility resonates without being overtly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clichés. The handling of ghosts as metaphors for unresolved grief feels fresh, though a few phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering meditation on impermanence. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
