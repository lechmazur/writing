<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's character is deeply nuanced, with clear motivation and a distinct arc. His envy and subsequent growth are palpable, but his "confident" trait feels slightly underutilized in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The fingerprint revelation is clever, though the shift from physical search to internal resolution could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vivid and immersive, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The hexagonal corridors and honeyed atmosphere are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext, potent symbolism (the ruler, the fingerprint), and emotional depth elevate this. The ending resonates, though the "jubilant remorse" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of envy and forgiveness is nuanced, though the "echo of yearning" phrasing borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically tight, with creative use of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, though the beehive setting could be more central to the conflict.</comment>
