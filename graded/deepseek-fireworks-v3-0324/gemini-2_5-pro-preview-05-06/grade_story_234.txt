<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's gentle swordsman persona contrasts beautifully with his cosmic ambitions, creating a compelling tension. His motivation is grand yet personal, and his voice is distinct through muttered dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the climax. The method (sundial angles) is inventive but could be better integrated. Pacing is tight yet effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dinosaur skeleton museum at night is masterfully atmospheric, with stark moonlight and cold air enhancing the cosmic theme. Sensory details (dust, shadows) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich literary craft—symbolism (matchbox), subtext (listening vs. summoning), and thematic depth (late bloomers, cosmic humility). Ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of emotion (e.g., "brusque affection" for the T. rex). Language is purposeful, though one or two metaphors verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. Creative fusion of concepts (swordsman + xenophile). Leaves a resonant question about cosmic connection.</comment>
