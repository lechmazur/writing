<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's eccentricity and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his actions and dialogue reinforcing his mad scientist persona. His interaction with the belt and Audrey III adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The ionizing method is creative but the abrupt film break disrupts momentum. The arc is clear, though resolution is minimal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with evocative sensory details (ozone smell, flickering film). The tea house and high-altitude setting enhance the eerie, otherworldly tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism in the belt, Audrey III as a character foil). The ending is purposeful, but the conflict resolution is abrupt. Themes of obsession and discovery are clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("sanity as questionable as the edibility of his Venus flytraps"). Avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct, engaging voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive integration of elements. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about Alistair's quest. Creative thinking evident in the film reel method.</comment>
