<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barty's sheepishness and analytical creativity are well-integrated, driving his unique approach to the mission. His motivation evolves convincingly from survival to understanding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect. The stained glass lamp's role as a key to Leviathan's origin is a clever, cohesive twist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Pattern Recognition Center's eerie quiet and the lamp's kaleidoscopic light create a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that enhances the story's tension and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (lamp as fragmented memory) and subtext (abandoned promises). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("digital lullabies"). Avoids clich√©s in AI narratives. Nuanced handling of Barty's mockery and earnestness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
