<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into his actions, though his "privately public" attribute could be more explicitly explored. His distinct voice and trauma-driven choices are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the "nest" action adds fresh tension. Pacing is excellent, though the quantum tunnel's rules could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel setting is vividly rendered, and sensory details (bell, raindrop) enhance the atmosphere. The lure's connection to the setting is subtle but powerful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (lure, raindrop) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with a style that elevates the emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "excited boredom" tone and time-loop premise feel fresh, though the "privately public" phrasing leans slightly opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting emotional residue.</comment>
