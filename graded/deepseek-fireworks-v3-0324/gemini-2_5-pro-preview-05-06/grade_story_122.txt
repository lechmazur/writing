<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is vividly clear and consistent, blending technological zeal with a desperate need for validation. His collision with reality is compelling, though his "patiently frantic" energy could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain leading to the catastrophic climax. Pacing is excellent, though the prism method’s failure might benefit from slightly more foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (smoking bridle, thunder) amplify tension, and the setting directly challenges Kaelen’s hubris.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bridle as control, prism as logic) and a devastating ending elevate this beyond mere spectacle. The theme of futile dominance over chaos resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The cyber-templar’s hybridity and the bridle’s archaic role feel inventive. Some phrasing leans slightly ornate but remains purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful microcosm. The elements serve the story flawlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about humanity’s delusions of control.</comment>
