<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and consistent, but their "indifferent enthusiasm" feels slightly underdeveloped. The digital exorcist role is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the botnet resolution feels abrupt. The receipt as a pivot point works elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest suit—abandoned spaces and digital decay merge evocatively. Sensory details (stale air, screen glow) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "digital miasma") enhance impact, but the ending lacks emotional weight. Theme of cleansing digital despair is timely but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise and execution, avoiding clichés. Some phrases ("indifferent enthusiasm") border on contrived, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though constrained by word count. Leaves a lingering thought about digital hauntings, but depth feels slightly truncated.</comment>
