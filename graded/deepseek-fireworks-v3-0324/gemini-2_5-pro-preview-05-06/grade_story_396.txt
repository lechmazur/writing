<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's charming forgetfulness and his disinterested passion create a distinct voice and motivation. His actions align well with his desire to shield the fragile wonder, though subtle inconsistencies in his forgetfulness could be polished.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiation drives the plot effectively, but the connection between the science fair and the vault feels tenuous. The pacing is strong, though the resolution slightly rushes Evron's change of heart.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The champagne vault and final performance create a rich, moody atmosphere. The stained-glass shard and setting are evocatively linked, though the vault's relevance to the negotiation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery (e.g., "shard of light") and subtext in the cultural clash. The ending is satisfying, but some dialogue leans toward exposition. The theme of preservation resonates well.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original handling of the urban forager concept, though "disinterested passion" toes the line of contrivance. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally over-polishes emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thoughtful narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers on the tension between progress and preservation.</comment>
