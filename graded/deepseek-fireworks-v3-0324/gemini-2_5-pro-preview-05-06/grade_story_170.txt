<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is nuanced and consistent, with her academic artistry and free-spirited nature blending naturally. Her motivation to confront shame is clear and drives her actions, though the herbalist aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with memorizing the letters serving as a pivotal action that resolves thematic tension. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the coral restoration station's role in the plot could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (salt, coral tanks) that enhance mood, but the setting's connection to Elara's internal conflict feels slightly superficial despite its vividness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (sewing kit as a key), layered themes (generational shame), and evocative prose. The ending is poignant and resonant, with minimal telling and strong showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally authentic, avoiding clichés. The handling of shame is nuanced, though the "heart of doubt" phrasing edges toward melodrama. Language is purposeful, not overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically dense, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. A few elements (herbalist, coral station) could integrate more tightly.</comment>
