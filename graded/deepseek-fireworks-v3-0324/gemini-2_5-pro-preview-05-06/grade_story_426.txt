<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's secretive nature and motivation to preserve folk medicines are well-developed and consistent. Her "angrily peaceful" resolve and interactions with Leo reveal depth, though her backstory as a forgotten prodigy could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's mission, with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight but effective; the hug scene resolves the arc nicely. The marathon training slightly distracts from the core conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and teapot create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (herbs, popcorn, disused tracks) immerse the reader. The setting uniquely supports Elara's isolation and mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teapot, playlists) and subtext (resilience vs. modernity). Ending is satisfying, though the "angrily peaceful" motif feels slightly overstated. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (playlist hacking as "digital seeds"). Avoids clich√©s; emotional resonance is shown through actions (the hug). Style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. Length feels deliberate; the plot lingers thoughtfully. Minor quibble: marathon training slightly dilutes focus on the core mission.</comment>
