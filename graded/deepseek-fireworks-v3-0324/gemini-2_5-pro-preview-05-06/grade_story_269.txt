<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias' nostalgia as a tailor is well-integrated, but his motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits feels slightly abrupt. His voice and actions are distinct, though more internal conflict would deepen his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the climax feels rushed. The connection between the broken code and the mirror's role could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk setting is vivid and immersive, with atmospheric details enhancing tension. The storm and mirror are brilliantly tied to Elias' emotional state.</comment>
