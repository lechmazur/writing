<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is vivid and consistent, his actions deeply aligned with his quest to salvage lost knowledge. His "frenzied" nature and the personal connection to the love letter add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from setup to resolution, with the cosmic tea-leaf method cleverly driving the search. Pacing is tight but not rushed, though the void's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The yawning void and abandoned summer create a haunting, evocative backdrop. Sensory details (starlight, dust) enrich the atmosphere, though the "final moment" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tea leaves as cosmic dust, the spiral sigil) and layered themes (loss, connection) elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the "muted euphoria" tone could be more consistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (juggling "forgotten languages") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "void" edges close to generic abstraction at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The elements cohere beautifully, with the love letter and tea leaves serving the theme organically. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of melancholic hope.</comment>
