<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's introspection and silent defiance are compelling, but their "loudly introverted" nature could be more vividly shown through actions or internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s slow, meditative pacing aligns well with Kael’s quest, though tighter cause-and-effect linking the CD to their courage could strengthen cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the neon cathedral and fog are immersive, with sensory details (ozone, crumbling concrete) elevating the post-human melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fireflies, CD) and a resonant theme of fragile hope. The ending’s quiet uplift is earned, though the CD’s impact could be less abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "loudly introverted" feels slightly contrived. The prose avoids cliché but occasionally strains for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story’s mood and theme, though the CD’s role could be deeper.</comment>
