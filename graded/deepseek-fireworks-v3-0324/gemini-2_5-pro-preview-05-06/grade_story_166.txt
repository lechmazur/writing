<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phineas is compelling with clear, consistent motivation and a distinct 'voice.' His 'solemnly silly' nature adds depth, though his ghostly aspect could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Phineas's actions, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect is logical, though the ending feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (crystalline apples, hissing steam) immerse the reader beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the straw, humming as communication) are effective. The ending is satisfying, but thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The plastic straw's mundanity juxtaposed with magic feels fresh. Nuanced emotions and unique style stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively. The brief length works, leaving a lingering question about fate. Creative and deliberate.</comment>
