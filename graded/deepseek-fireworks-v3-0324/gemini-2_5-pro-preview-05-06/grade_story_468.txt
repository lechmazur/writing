<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and mortician background are well-integrated, driving her unique hobby and interactions with the spirits. Her motivation is clear and consistent, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the bracelet and vanishing footprints serving as clever, logical devices. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vividly rendered, with evocative sensory details ("dawn-kissed water," "shimmering water") deepening immersion. Atmosphere perfectly supports the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dream journals as curated souls) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending satisfies while hinting at deeper themes of memory and liminality. Conflict is subtle but resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Descriptors are specific ("skeletal fingers grasping"), and the mortician-mangrove connection feels inventive. Minor risk of "polite anarchy" bordering on twee.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the spirits' true nature.</comment>
