<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear but his personality lacks depth beyond his alchemist role. The coin's connection to his grandmother hints at deeper layers, but his reactions remain somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot coheres well with clever use of coincidences, though some transitions feel abrupt. The arc is complete but slightly rushed in resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed, with strong sensory immersion. The suburban-lab contrast works, and the tar pit setting is vividly unsettling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (butterfly, coin) is effective, and the theme of kinship resonates. Ending is satisfying, though the emotional payoff could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on mystical-trope phrasing ("invisible thread," "arcane knowledge"). Some descriptions verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story cohesively, but the chrysalis/butterfly motif feels slightly contrived. Length suits the narrative.</comment>
