<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is compelling and consistent, evolving from grief to cosmic curiosity. His "softly militant" resolve adds depth, though his late-blooming heroism could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The spyglass discovery and Hemlock confrontation drive momentum, though the rooftop farm setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (tarnished brass, scarred heavens) amplifying the post-apocalyptic tone. The rooftop farm could be more vividly integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (celestial web, cosmic dance) and subtext. The ending resonates with reluctant awe, though dialogue with Hemlock could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cosmic-balance theme is nuanced, though "softly militant" occasionally feels strained as a descriptor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. The length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic depth. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
