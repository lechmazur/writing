<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miles Corbin’s exhaustion and cynicism are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His reaction to the Jack of Diamonds reveals depth, though his "confidently unsure" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the kaleidoscope’s trigger, but the connection to the old foe feels slightly rushed. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Vanishing Point Gallery’s atmosphere is richly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the heist’s pretentious wreckage. The setting and object (kaleidoscope) tie meaningfully to the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., the kaleidoscope as symbolism) and a memorable perspective. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "shadow puppet animated by caffeine"). Minimal clichés, but the "molten sarcasm" phrasing edges toward repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with creative integration of the playing card and kaleidoscope. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic punch.</comment>
