<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and consistent, with her nomadic spirit and ancestral compass driving her actions. Her 'ferocious politeness' and internal conflict are well-portrayed, though her distinct voice could be sharper in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with Elara's intervention logically stemming from her motives. The tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution, but the arc remains satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flower pressing workshop and its cloying atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the contrast with Elara's wild spirit. Sensory details (scent, touch) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mariner’s wheel, ivy bindings) and subtext. The ending delivers emotional weight, though the "anguished joy" tone could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on ornate. Emotion is shown well via action and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, serving the story’s theme of true harmony vs. control. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about compromise.</comment>
