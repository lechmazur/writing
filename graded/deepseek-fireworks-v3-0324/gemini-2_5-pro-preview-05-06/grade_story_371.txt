<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending selflessness with cynicism. His use of the marbles and hatpin reveals depth, though his "fervent apathy" could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Jax's desperation, but the marbles' magic feels slightly abrupt. The resolution is satisfying, though the word limit strains cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the storm's aftermath enhances the atmosphere. The neon and grime contrast well with Jax's antique methods.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (marbles as divination, hatpin as relic) elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the emotional impact could delve deeper beyond surface apathy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original world-building and fresh metaphors (e.g., "bruised sky"). The voice avoids clich√©s, though the "swashbuckler" archetype leans slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers but could sharpen thematic cohesion between kindness and adversity.</comment>
