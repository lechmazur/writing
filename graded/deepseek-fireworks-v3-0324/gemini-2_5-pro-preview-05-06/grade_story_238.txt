<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with a clear, haunting motivation; his abrasive charm and droning ritual reveal depth. His voice is distinct, though his backstory could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven around fragmented confessions, but the climax lacks punch. Pacing is strong, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival booth and hushed twilight are masterfully atmospheric. Sensory details (peeling paint, soft wallet) immerse the reader flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (midnight as a thief, locket symbolism) elevate the story. The theme of lost light resonates, though the ending’s subtlety risks underwhelming.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("leather soft as a forgotten sin"). Nuanced emotion and a unique stylistic voice avoid AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, but the word limit slightly stifles thematic expansion. Still, it lingers with haunting poignancy.</comment>
