<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and motivation are deeply intertwined, with his past as a wilderness guide informing his present salvage work. His distinct voice and internal conflict are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the crocheted log as a unique driving force. The resolution feels earned despite the word limit, though pacing could marginally tighten.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken ship's atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (barnacles, water-logged opulence), amplifying Elias's isolation and the ghostly weight of history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—layers of symbolism (ring as compass, textile as code), resonant subtext, and a hauntingly satisfying conclusion that transcends the literal treasure hunt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The crocheted diary is a standout invention, and emotional nuance avoids AI pitfalls (e.g., "a profound, guiltily innocent" is subtly human).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A rare cohesive gem—elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance and lingering questions.</comment>
