<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her calm yet furious demeanor is compelling, and her "faithfully odd" nature is well-integrated. However, deeper emotional nuances could be explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness despite the word limit. The train whistle as a signal works, but the transition to "resuming" could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and dawn setting are vivid and immersive, enhancing the story's tone. Sensory details (dust motes, train whistle) are effectively used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and a memorable voice. The ending is purposeful, though the central conflict could be more pronounced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers after reading.</comment>
