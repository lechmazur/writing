<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The swamp fortress and pre-cosmic setting are vividly evoked, enhancing the story's mythic tone. Sensory details (e.g., "damp, echoing halls," "primordial ooze") immerse the reader, and the atmosphere reinforces the conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with rich symbolism (yarn swift as a loom of creation) and layered subtext. The ending is deeply satisfying, and the writing style elevates the narrative without feeling overwrought.</comment>
