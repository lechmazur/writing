<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward with urgency. Her distinct voice and actions reveal depth, though her "strangely trustworthy" attribute could be more thoroughly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is effective, and the climax resonates, though the restroom discovery feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with vivid sensory details. The garage's atmosphere enhances the story's mystical tension, though the corridor's hush is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, imagery) are masterfully deployed. The ending is poignant and thematically rich, though the "frantic peace" tone could be more sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The seashell's symbolism is fresh, but minor phrases ("slumbering beasts") verge on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the restroom method slightly strains credulity.</comment>
