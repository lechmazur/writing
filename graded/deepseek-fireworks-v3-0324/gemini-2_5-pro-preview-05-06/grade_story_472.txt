<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply integrated with her unconventional methods and renegade status. Her distinct voice and sensitivity are well-conveyed, though her backstory could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the button's revelation serving as a satisfying pivot. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating library and "between channels" setting are vividly evoked, enhancing the story's ethereal tone. Sensory details (e.g., the button's texture) are sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices (e.g., the button as a cosmic tuner), the story lingers in the mind. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the conflict with the Consortium feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The prose is elegant but not overly ornate, and the emotional depth feels authentic. Minor quibble: "sharp gentleness" teeters on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the story’s depth transcends its length.</comment>
