<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai’s motivation is clear and compelling, blending mystery with a sacred calling. However, his underwater welder background feels underutilized beyond surface-level contrast.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-effect chain. Pacing is excellent, though the timeline crossover could be slightly more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (fractured light, glitching stars) that deepen the surreal tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling is immersive, with potent symbolism (the button box) and a haunting ending. Minor critique: "inherited mystery" could be more explicitly woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, though "patiently impatient" verges on cliché. Language is purposeful, avoiding AI-generic traps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the word count feeling deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of infinite possibility.</comment>
