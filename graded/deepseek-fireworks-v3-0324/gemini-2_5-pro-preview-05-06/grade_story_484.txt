<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby’s motivation is clear and well-developed, with his brewing background informing his actions and internal monologue. However, his "groggy" trait could be more consistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and progresses logically, but the climax feels slightly abrupt. The word limit constraints are managed well, though the resolution could be more definitive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The graveyard and mansion setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The protest’s "lull" adds a unique tension.</comment>
