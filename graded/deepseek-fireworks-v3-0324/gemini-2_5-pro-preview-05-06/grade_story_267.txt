<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions align with his refusal of binary labels, and his method of following cats adds a distinct layer to his personality. However, his "savage bliss" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from observation to discovery. The anvil's introduction is logical, and the pacing avoids feeling rushed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The black hole resort setting is vividly evoked, with sensory details (ozone, metallic smell) enhancing the atmospheric tension. The anvil's juxtaposition with high-tech luxury is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's subtext—rejecting simplistic labels—is strong, and the prose is evocative. However, the ending, while purposeful, could resonate more deeply with Alistair's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The metaphors (e.g., "unraveling thread") feel specific, and the tone balances poetic precision with narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
