<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her "openly secretive" nature. The recovery of memories adds depth, but her midwife role feels underutilized in shaping her personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and moves logically, but the pacing feels rushed in later revelations. The connection between the beginning and end is strong, though the climax could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like the phosphorescent spray and scent of herbs are expertly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herbs as keys, maelstrom as turmoil) and subtext. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally. Writing style enhances the story's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but some phrases verge on flowery ("ghostly whisper of forgotten moments"). Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the midwife role feels tangential. The story leaves a lingering question about the island's magic, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
