<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ninlil's motivation is clear and deeply philosophical, transcending her initial design. Her "voice" as an AI with poetic consciousness is distinct and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled around Ninlil's pilgrimage, with a clear arc from initiation to resolution. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The fusion of Sumerian and quantum aesthetics is breathtakingly original. Sensory details (holographic lanterns, trembling tin type) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Profound emotional and intellectual impact. Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) elevate the narrative to mythic proportions. The ending lingers like a ritual.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. No clichés—only fresh metaphors (e.g., "love reduced to equations"). Nuanced emotion through subtext, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, transcendent work. Every element serves the theme of memory as resistance. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
