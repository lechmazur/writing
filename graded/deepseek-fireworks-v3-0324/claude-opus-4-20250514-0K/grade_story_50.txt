<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from unconvinced missionary to a conduit of doubt-based faith is compelling and well-paced, with his actions and motivations subtly revealed through his interactions with the fork and the butterfly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with precision, balancing mystery and revelation. The piano's echoes as a decoding mechanism is inventive, and the tight word limit enhances the story's urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The glass desert is hauntingly vivid, with sensory details (light on crystal dunes, humming piano strings) creating an atmosphere that mirrors Marcus's internal conflict perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, fork, piano) and layered subtext about faith and doubt elevate the narrative. The ending is resonant, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "capriciously consistent"). No clichés; the prose is lyrical yet purposeful, avoiding purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s thematic core. The brevity feels deliberate, and the combination of elements is ingenious, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
