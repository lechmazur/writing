<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly portrayed with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in his defiance of tradition and fascination with death. His "consistently strange" attribute drives his actions, and his distinct voice shines through.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's experimentation and the sparrow's reanimation creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect is logical despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The abandoned laboratory setting is richly atmospheric, enhanced by sensory details (spices, warped ruler). The tone of "defiant compassion" permeates the world, amplifying the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (death as a punchline) and symbolism. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of transformation resonates deeply. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. Emotion is nuanced, and the voice feels uniquely human. No signs of formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth. Creative and impactful.</comment>
