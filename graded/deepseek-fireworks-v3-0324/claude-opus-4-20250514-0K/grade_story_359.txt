<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly rendered, his motivation clear and poignant, anchored by his tactile relationship with loss and craftsmanship. His "absent-minded" trait subtly manifests in his aimless wandering, yet his passion for imperfection is sharp.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot hinges elegantly on the station encounter, with the archive and brewery failures reinforcing his arc. Pacing is tight, and the ending resolves with quiet defiance rather than abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The archive and station merge into a haunting liminal space, where extinct sounds and gestures amplify the melancholy. Sensory details (brass’s coldness, cedar-tainted beer) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story thrives on layered symbolism (lion knocker as guardian, kinesthizing as defiance) and subtext about human obsolescence. Dialogue is sparse but potent, and the ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and unflinching in its exploration of loss. Avoids clichés by grounding the sci-fi elements in tactile humanity. Metaphors (hope "tasting fresh," storms of doubt) feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive, haunting narrative. The brevity serves the intimacy, and the theme of "useless" artistry resonates deeply.</comment>
