<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and cheerful disposition are well-integrated with her discovery of ancestral secrets, though her "prudent knight" role could be more actively demonstrated in her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from discovery to revelation, with strong cause-and-effect pacing. The tight word limit is used effectively, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The Minoan palace setting and atmospheric details (e.g., flickering fixtures, shifting frescoes) are brilliantly evocative and deeply tied to the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (DNA as data, the binder ring's warmth) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, though the transition to "living archive" could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clich√©s. The genetic-key twist feels fresh, though some phrases ("pulsing with bronze-age heat") edge toward ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity enhances its mythic tone, though the climax could be more fully realized.</comment>
