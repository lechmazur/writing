<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hendrik's backstory and motivation are subtly yet powerfully conveyed, with scars serving as both physical and emotional markers. His "intensely relaxed" demeanor is a masterful touch, revealing his training and trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the well's dual nature as a wishing spot and escape route driving the narrative. The pacing is deliberate, though the tight word limit slightly truncates Maria's role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly immersive—oxidation-matching scars, the well's deceptive depth, and the "inherited mystery" of the tunnels. Sensory details (polished coins, shadow patterns) deepen the noir-esque tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the well as a metaphor for buried identities, scars as subtext for betrayal, and the cyclical nature of espionage. The ending lingers with poignant ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh and original—no clichés. The conceit of the wishing-well attendant as a spy is inventive, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A nearly flawless microcosm of espionage tragedy. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant unanswered questions.</comment>
