<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's motivations are clear and compelling, with his dual identity as gambler and hidden aristocrat driving the narrative. His "peaceful anger" and obsession are well-integrated, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with Marcus's subtle manipulation of players advancing his goal. The connection between charity drives and his secret mission is clever, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds are vividly rendered, with sensory details (pulsing larvae, synchronized flashing) enriching the atmosphere. The setting reinforces both Marcus's mission and the lost kingdom's memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ledger as legacy, hydrolysis as renewal) and subtext (unbecoming as strategy). The ending is purposeful, though the theme of ecological restoration could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "unbecoming like petals"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "lost kingdom" trope leans slightly generic. Emotional resonance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, with the ledger and hydrolysis reactions central to the plot. The brevity feels deliberate, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>
