<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elena's storm-chaser background and reluctant devotion to restoration create a compelling tension. Her "eagerly unwilling" nature is vividly conveyed, though her transition to acceptance could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the carousel's restoration serving as both goal and metaphor. Minor pacing issues in the middle, but the solstice climax lands powerfully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and dormant carousel are richly atmospheric, with frost and lightning used to mirror Elena's duality. Sensory details (brass poles, mountain wind) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (tongs as legacy, carousel as transformation). The ending resonates, though the abbot's dialogue feels slightly didactic. Theme of balance is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original: no clich√©s, fresh metaphors ("nostalgic innovation"), and nuanced emotional subtext. The storm-carousel symbiosis is ingeniously crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of duality and purpose.</comment>
