<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moonlit archer's motivation is clear and compelling, though her "aimlessly passionate" nature could be more deeply explored to justify her ultimate sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the final twist (children in stasis) feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical story where every element serves the narrative and theme. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
