<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlene's motivation and backstory are vividly clear, though her "sly agent" aspect feels slightly underdeveloped compared to her emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the fork as both symbol and macguffin. Pacing is excellent, though Harrison's arrival borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carnival setting is hauntingly evocative, amplifying themes of loss and rebellion. Sensory details (rust, tarnish, light) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (fork as conduit), poetic prose, and a resonant ending that lingers. Dialogue is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Only minor nit: "digital wind" slightly generic vs. the story’s otherwise fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for the reader’s imagination to expand the world.</comment>
