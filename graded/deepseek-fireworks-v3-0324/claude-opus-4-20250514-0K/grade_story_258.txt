<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and compelling, but her emotional depth could be more nuanced. Her actions align well with her role, though her 'voice' remains somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a strong arc. The storm of secrets as a climax is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized, blending magic and realism. Sensory details (salt spray, humming trees) enrich the atmosphere, though the driftwood platform could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and strong symbolism elevate the story. The ending resonates, but the thematic depth of cultural preservation could be more explicitly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "jaded wonder" tone occasionally slips into over-familiarity. The dance motif is fresh, but some phrases edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, memorable vignette. The elements serve the story elegantly, and the length feels intentional. Leaves a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
