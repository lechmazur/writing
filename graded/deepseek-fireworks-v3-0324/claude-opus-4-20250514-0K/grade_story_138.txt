<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Erasmus's motivations are clear, consistent, and deeply intertwined with his noble background and personal disillusionment. His actions and dialogue reveal a complex, nuanced character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each stub's combustion serving as a microcosm of his larger arc. The pacing is deliberate yet purposeful, though the word limit slightly truncates resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's sterile, controlled environment contrasts beautifully with the emotional volatility of the act. Sensory details (flames, smoke, drone whirring) heighten immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tickets as lies, fire as truth) and subtext. The ending resonates with thematic weight—destruction as liberation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and execution. Avoids clichés; metaphors (e.g., "a sound like wind through empty rooms") feel fresh. Emotional nuance elevates it beyond algorithmic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering question: How much of ourselves do we burn to be free?</comment>
