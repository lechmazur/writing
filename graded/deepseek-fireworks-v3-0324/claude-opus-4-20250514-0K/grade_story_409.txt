<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict and motivation are exceptionally clear and deeply woven into his actions and the symbolism of the clockwork animals. His 'voice' and self-deception are distinct and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from denial to realization. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The attic and clockwork animals create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that amplifies Marcus's isolation and self-confrontation. Sensory details (gears clicking, split knuckles) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The story is layered with symbolism (the shard, the wolf) and evokes profound emotional resonance. The ending is both satisfying and thematically rich, with exceptional "show, don't tell" craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with no clich√©s or formulaic phrasing. The handling of Marcus's duality and the clockwork metaphor feels fresh and deeply human.</comment>
