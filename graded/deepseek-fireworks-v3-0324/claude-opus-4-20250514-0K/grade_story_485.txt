<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's impulsively thoughtful nature and brazen raider persona are well-developed, but Markov's motivations could be more subtly nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, logical progression with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
