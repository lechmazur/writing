<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's transformation from prideful duelist to someone capable of forgiveness is compelling and well-executed. Her motivations and reactions align with her fatal flaw and growth arc, though her initial cheerlessness could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Vera's search for recipes to her emotional reckoning. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., cooking revealing victims' lives) are logical and impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and humming server rooms create a haunting, evocative atmosphere that enhances the story's themes of isolation and transformation. Sensory details (maggots, holograms) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is profound, with layered symbolism (butterflies, elasticized reflections) and subtext about guilt and redemption. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "salt becoming memory") and nuanced handling of emotion. The writing style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>
