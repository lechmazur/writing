<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's layered motivations—exile, guilt, and a compulsive need to decode—are vividly conveyed. His "professional scapegoat" role is original yet coherent with his past. The washer as an anchor to his abandoned identity is a masterful touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect logic is tight, but the midnight call’s urgency feels underexplored. The ending’s reflective tone compensates for a slightly rushed middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cloud city’s synthetic mist and recycled air amplify Marcus’s fluid identity. "Vapor-locked towers" and "forgotten prayers" are standout sensory details that deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (washer as halo, refashioned guilt) and subtext (sacred geometry in breathing patterns) elevate the craft. The ending’s unresolved mystery lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the scapegoat premise and "robustly delicate" paradox. Minor flaw: "obsessive calm" leans slightly toward telling, not showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, stylistically assured vignette. The word limit feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance beyond plot.</comment>
