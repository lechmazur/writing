<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marina’s selective mutism and ventriloquist dummy create a distinct, compelling voice. Her motivation (archiving weather) is clear, but her optimism could use more nuanced exploration and grounding in her past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the overheard call, but the parallel universe premise feels slightly underdeveloped for the tight word count. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The parallel beach setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (purple foam, twin suns). The diner’s neon sign and coffee sleeve reinforce tone and character isolation effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth (found family, archiving the impossible) and literary devices (symbolism in the compass rose). The ending is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (rain falling upward) and originality in genre-blending. Minimal reliance on tropes, though the "overheard call" device edges toward convention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers on themes of belonging and cosmic curiosity, though the parallel universe mechanics could be sharper.</comment>
