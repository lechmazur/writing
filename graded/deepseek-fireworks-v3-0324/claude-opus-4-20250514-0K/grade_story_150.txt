<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas Kane is vividly drawn, with clear motivation rooted in inherited mysticism and poetic rebellion. His actions align with his outlaw-poet duality, though his "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with dice rolls driving cause-and-effect seamlessly. Pacing excels despite word limit, though climax feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Steampunk dome and shifting graffiti create a mesmerizing, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details (brass, crystalline panels) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (dice/stars/words) and subtext. Ending resonates deeply, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original blend of cowboy, poet, and cosmic tropes. Fresh metaphors ("stars wrapped in words") avoid clich√©. Emotional nuance shines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Elements interlock brilliantly. Length feels intentional, leaving a haunting thematic aftertaste.</comment>
