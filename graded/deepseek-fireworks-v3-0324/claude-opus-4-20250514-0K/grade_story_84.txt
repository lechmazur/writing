<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcel's theatricality and desperation are vividly rendered, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His past kindnesses, though hidden, align perfectly with his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is taut and coherent, with riddles driving urgency. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly truncates the buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is evocative and integral, enhancing the surreal tension. Sensory details (cracked leather, barnacle walls) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of subtext (performance vs. authenticity) and symbolism (the case as soul). The ending resonates with quiet profundity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("frenzied tranquility") and a twist on tropes (actor’s redemption) defy predictability. Nuanced emotion avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting thematic aftertaste.</comment>
