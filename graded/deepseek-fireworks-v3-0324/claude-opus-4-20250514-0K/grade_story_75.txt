<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Korvain's guarded yet open-ended skepticism and his layered past with the resistance are compelling. His reaction to Elena's truth reveals depth, though his shift to openness with the young woman feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven—decrypting the vows reveals Elena's principled betrayal, reframing the myth of the revolution. Pacing is strong, with a clear arc despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nano-forest is brilliantly oppressive yet fragile, a microcosm of surveillance and rebellion. Sensory details (synthetic leaves, the bird's song) amplify tension and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the bookmark symbolizes lost unity, the "angry peace" subverts revolution tropes, and the ending lingers. Subtext about myth vs. truth elevates it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh—no clichés in the dystopia or rebellion. Nuanced handling of "disowning violence" feels human, not algorithmic. Language is precise, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where elements serve theme and character. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on memory and sacrifice.</comment>
