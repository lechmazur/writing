<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Enkidu's sentimental nature and spontaneous impulsiveness are well-developed, driving his actions believably. His motivation to seek justice for his brother is clear, but his sudden shift to revolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced within the word limit, but the leap from finding the hairpin to conspiring against the king could use smoother transitions. The ending is purposeful, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Sumerian palace setting is richly evocative, with sensory details (tarnished copper, crumbling cedar) enhancing the atmosphere. The abandoned ruins mirror the decay of justice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hairpin, tablet) and subtext ("chaos as humanity's harshest teacher"). The ending lingers with thematic weight. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of historical and literary elements feels distinctive, though some metaphors (e.g., "chaotic humility") lean abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a resonant question about justice and rebellion.</comment>
