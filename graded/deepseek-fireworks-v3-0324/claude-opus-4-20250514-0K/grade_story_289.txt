<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s scholarly curiosity and nuanced reaction to the doll reveal depth, though her internal monologue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful progression with a resonant twist; minor pacing hiccups in the climax’s luminosity overload.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion; the bay’s glow and shifting patterns elevate the alien setting to near-perfect symbiosis with theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole; the doll’s role as both artifact and key feels inevitable, not contrived.</comment>
