<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mira's pragmatic yet profound nature is vividly portrayed, with her motivations and actions tightly aligned. Her "lavishly humble" poverty and grandfather's teachings shape her distinct voice and decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Mira's manufactured miracle resolving the curse logically. Pacing is excellent, and cause-effect relationships are clear despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village and "dreadful hope" atmosphere are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (bark, humming hammer) deepening immersion. Setting and object (hammer) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (hammer as conductor), subtext (miracles as crafted interventions), and emotional resonance. The ending is both satisfying and thematically rich, with layered storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "manufactured miracle" concept feels fresh, and prose is purposeful yet poetic. Nuanced emotions (e.g., "dreadful hope") avoid AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of wonder.</comment>
