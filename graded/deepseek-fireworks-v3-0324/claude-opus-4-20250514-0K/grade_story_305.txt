<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's scholarly reticence and technically mischievous nature are vividly portrayed, driving her rebellion against academic stagnation. Her motivation is clear, but her transformation into an impish rebel could use slightly more grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the baking timer and acoustic sabotage creating urgency. Cause-and-effect is logical, though the flooded opera house's role in the plan could be clarified further.</comment>
