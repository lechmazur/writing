<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and compelling, though her backstory could be more deeply explored. Her actions align well with her desire to reclaim her identity, but her "poetically rational" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The journal's corrosion and orchard's role as an archive are effectively integrated, though the transition to Maya's final act could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underground orchard is vividly rendered, with sensory details (bioluminescence, orchestra tuning) enhancing atmosphere. The setting is integral to the plot and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (orchard as memory bank) and subtext (ghostwriters' rebellion). Ending is satisfying, though the senator's downfall feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "poetically rational"). Avoids clich√©s, though the fungal preservation trope edges close to overused bio-memory concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story, and the brief format feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about power and authorship.</comment>
