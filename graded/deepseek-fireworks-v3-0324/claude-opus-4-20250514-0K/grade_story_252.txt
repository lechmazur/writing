<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The thief's transformation from hollow villain to guardian is compelling, with clear motivation and alignment of actions. The wooden block serves as a powerful symbol of her past and catalyst for change.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight yet expansive plot structure; the crack and petals logically guide the narrative to a resonant resolution. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The vault's sterile-yet-magical atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory contrast (frost vs. petals). Setting and object enhance theme and character perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Flawless craftsmanship: the "icy warmth" motif, layered symbolism (block, fruits, swing), and subtext about preservation vs. theft create profound impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("loved these fruits with a hatred born of envy"), and genuine emotional weight in the thief's redemption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s depth; the brevity feels intentional, leaving haunting resonance (the swing set’s silence as a narrative echo).</comment>
