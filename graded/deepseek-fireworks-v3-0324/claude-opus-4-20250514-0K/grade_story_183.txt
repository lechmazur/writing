<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wayfarer's motivation is clear and her actions align with her established traits, though her inner conflict could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's tight structure and cosmic scale are brilliantly balanced, but the resolution’s ambiguity might frustrate some readers.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite fusion of setting and atmosphere—the dimensional rift and abandoned theatre are vividly rendered, though the "memory flickers into legend" timeframe feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of paradox as a literary device, with haunting subtext and a purposeful ending. The prose occasionally verges on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, though the "intensely quiet" tone risks monotony. Some metaphors (e.g., "light through prisms") edge toward the familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s brevity feels deliberate, and its cohesion is remarkable given the density of themes. Lingers like a half-remembered dream.</comment>
