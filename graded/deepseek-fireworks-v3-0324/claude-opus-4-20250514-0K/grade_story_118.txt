<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Nexus's hive-mind consciousness and her rebellion against the agency are compelling, but Marcus's transformation could use deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution of Marcus’s arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The facility's oppressive atmosphere is vivid and enhances the tension, but the "sound of hindsight" could be more tangibly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concepts (hive-mind therapist, wax language) stand out, though some phrases edge toward melodrama ("wind chimes in seventeen keys").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the length feels deliberate. The ending lingers, though Marcus’s role could be more pivotal.</comment>
