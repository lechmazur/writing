<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Meredith's character is vividly realized, with her grief, defiance, and cunning all driving her actions consistently. Her "voice" and motivation are clear and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to rebellion. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect chain (postcards → defiance → divine unease) is logical and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fog-laden ruin and forge atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (glowing iron, singed postcards) deepen the world’s haunting yet defiant mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The storytelling is rich with subtext (mortal defiance as alchemy for joy) and striking imagery. The ending thrums with thematic and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. Tropes are subverted (gods as petty, grief as fuel for wit), and the prose balances lyricism with precision. No AI-generic tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with brevity amplifying impact. The story lingers long after reading, a testament to its layered depth.</comment>
