<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her past in the Order shaping her actions. Her uncertainly certain grace adds depth, though more inner conflict could enhance her complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with methodical pacing and clear cause-and-effect. The echo test drives the action organically, though the finale's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library's decaying grandeur and sensory details (dust motes, brittle petals) immerse the reader. The setting amplifies the theme of forgotten magic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (rosebud, pipes) and subtext elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally, though dialogue with the starlight creature could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically potent vignette. The brief length serves the story's urgency, leaving a lingering question about reconciliation.</comment>
