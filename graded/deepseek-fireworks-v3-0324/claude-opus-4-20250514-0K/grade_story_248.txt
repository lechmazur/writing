<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's cybernetic instability and her shift from salvation-seeker to witness are compelling, though her "coyly furious" attribute could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent progression with a revelatory climax. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the prophecy's mechanics could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”corroded tech, gravitational waves, and the bird's brass wings create a vivid, immersive dystopian space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Powerful subtext (prophecy as manipulation), layered symbolism, and a haunting ending. The bird's dialogue is slightly stiff but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("destiny's harsh arithmetic") and nuanced emotion, though "cheerless ecstasy" edges toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the collision serving as both plot and thematic fulcrum. Lingers provocatively.</comment>
