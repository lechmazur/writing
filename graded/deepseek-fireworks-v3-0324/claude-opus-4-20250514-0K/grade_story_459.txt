<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "elegantly clumsy" nature and ghost-seeing ability deeply influencing her actions. Her distinct voice emerges through her methodical approach to the supernatural, revealing layers of her personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with Maya's act of liberation driving a clear arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause/effect relationships (e.g., flower crown → ghost's release) are logical and resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Sand Castle Preservation Lab is a masterful setting, its silence amplifying the ghosts' presence. Sensory details (brittle petals, granular sand) enrich the atmosphere, making the world feel tactile and haunting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the flower crown's symbolism, the layered theme of preservation/haunting, and the ending's quiet revelation ("liberation lived...") showcase literary depth. The story lingers long after reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The elevator technician premise and sand castle ghosts feel fresh, and the prose balances precision with poetic nuance. Emotional resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. The ending’s paradox ("preservation is just another word for haunting") elevates it further.</comment>
