<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving her actions with a mix of scientific curiosity and unresolved grief. Her "bitterly optimistic" determination adds nuance, though her rapid acceptance of multidimensional perception could use more exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the parking stub as a clever Chekhov's gun. The detour-to-revelation arc feels organic, though the climax's pacing slightly rushes the metaphysical stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology station is vividly rendered, with crystalline clouds and flickering reality enhancing the story's uncanny atmosphere. Sensory details (crumpling stub, rippling floors) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance—inheritance as both burden and key—elevates the sci-fi premise. Symbolism (stub as memento/key) and layered conflict (personal vs. existential) make the ending linger.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of cosmic horror and emotional reckoning, though "lost heiress" feels familiar. Fragmented-reality prose avoids cliché, but Dr. Chen's dialogue leans slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette where elements serve the story's eerie heart. The brevity amplifies its existential punch, though some concepts beg expansion.</comment>
