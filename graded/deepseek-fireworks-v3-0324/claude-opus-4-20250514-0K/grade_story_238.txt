<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Murphy's motivation is clear and consistent, with his abrasively charming voice adding depth. The shifting photograph subtly reveals his emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful pacing with a clear arc. The payphone confessions drive the plot coherently, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—abandoned carnival and liminal timeframe mesh perfectly. Sensory details (flickering light, warm receiver) deepen the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (light, midnight) and layered subtext. The ending satisfies while leaving room for interpretation. Dialogue is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original. No clichés; metaphors feel fresh (e.g., "confessional for the lost"). Nuanced handling of grief and fractured reality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Elements serve the story organically, and the enigmatic tone lingers.</comment>
