<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's transformation from a naive gambler to someone who understands deeper truths is compelling. Marsh's terminal diagnosis adds layers to his motivations, though his "unhinged" nature could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc within the tight word limit, but the transition from Marsh's death to Eleanor's role feels slightly rushed. Cause and effect are clear, though pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal station setting is vividly atmospheric, and candlelit dinners amplify the mood. Sensory details (wax, humming generators) deepen immersion, though the ocean's chaos could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candles as unplaced bets) and Marsh's final lesson elevate the story. Dialogue is sharp, but the ending's emotional punch slightly over-relies on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "playing against time" edges toward melodrama. The candle mold motif feels fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The brief length works, but Marsh's death and the inquiry board could be more integrated. Leaves a lingering existential weight.</comment>
