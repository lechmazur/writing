<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wanderer's stoic nature and clear motivation to preserve painful truths are compellingly portrayed, though a touch more nuance in her emotional restraint could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, but the climax (memory extraction) feels slightly rushed—another 50 words could have deepened its impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the training ground's grotesque yet melancholic details ("rabbits with too many eyes") and the board's eerie blandness create a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful storytelling with rich subtext (tradition as betrayal) and evocative imagery ("chalk dust swirled like dying moths"). Only the ending’s tenderness verges on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("voice flat as winter stone"), and a nuanced exploration of morally gray preservation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements; the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering unease about cyclical violence in tradition.</comment>
