<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira-7's nostalgia and anxiously fearless nature are well-integrated into her actions and dialogue, though her "brazen modesty" could be more distinctly showcased.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The levitation facility and crystalline cave are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing tension. Dawn’s symbolism is subtly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., betrayal "fizzing"), but some dialogue leans expository. Ending resonates, though deeper subtext could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh descriptors (e.g., "carbonation through glass"), though "anxiously fearless" risks feeling contrived. Avoids clichés admirably.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, and the length feels intentional. Lingers on the cost of memory and trust, suggesting thematic depth.</comment>
