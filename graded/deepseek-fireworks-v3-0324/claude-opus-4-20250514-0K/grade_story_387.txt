<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's selflessness is deeply ingrained in his actions and sacrifices, creating a poignant and consistent character arc. His motivation is clear and compelling, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the chimes and record driving the narrative organically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-effect logic is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is breathtakingly vivid, with sensory details (sound, touch) masterfully evoking the ship's eerie, lyrical atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (vinyl as trust, chimes as maps) and subtext (sacrifice as legacy). The ending is both satisfying and haunting, with layered themes of guidance and loss.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lyrical but purposeful. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext, not exposition. Only minor stylization edges toward "purple."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. A rare example of compressed yet expansive storytelling.</comment>
