<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cornelius is vividly realized with a distinct voice and motivation, blending whimsy and rationality seamlessly. His actions reveal his paradoxical nature—both analytical and enchanted by the impossible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pitcher's transformation driving the narrative. The ending resolves cleanly while leaving thematic echoes. Pacing is deftly managed within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The clocktower's abyss is hauntingly immersive, with sensory details (sound-eating shadows, fossilizing flowers) elevating the atmosphere. Setting and object are symbiotically linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("time moved sideways like a crab learning waltz") and symbolism. The ending subverts expectation with ironic profundity, leaving lasting thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive marvel—every element serves the story’s core. The brevity feels intentional, heightening its density. Lingers like the pitcher’s absence-weight.</comment>
