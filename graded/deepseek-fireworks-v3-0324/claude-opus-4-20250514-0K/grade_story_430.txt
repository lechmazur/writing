<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope park is a masterclass in atmospheric worldbuilding—surreal yet tactile, with grotesque details that amplify the story's themes. Sensory immersion is exceptional, from "stars dripping like honey" to the park's mechanical breath.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are wielded with precision. The story evokes dread and melancholy, and the central conflict—Thane's struggle against his nature—resonates deeply. The ending lingers with haunting subtext.</comment>
