<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chen's motivation is clear and nuanced, evolving through subtle interactions. Kowalski's voice is distinct, but minor characters lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with debris impacts and picnics driving revelation. Pacing excels within constraints, though resolution leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly immersive—postcards and recycled air anchor the cosmic melancholy. Sensory details (rustling, gyroscopic lurches) heighten tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice avoids cliché. Emotional nuance in small gestures (bent coathangers) feels authentically human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically. Word limit feels intentional, leaving space for reader reflection on loss and connection.</comment>
