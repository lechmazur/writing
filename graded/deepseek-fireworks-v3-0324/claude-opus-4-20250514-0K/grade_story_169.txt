<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's character is vividly realized with a clear, unique motivation. His "soul-broker" role and connection to forgotten songs add depth. His actions align perfectly with his established traits, though his "grandiose modesty" could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dusty wine bottle and song revelation driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels natural. Minor coherence hiccup with "weirdly static" dust, which isn't fully explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—ethereal markets, floating tea platform, and "recycling" timeframe blend seamlessly. Sensory details (steam, music) enhance immersion. The setting elevates the story’s whimsical yet profound tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative and layered, with strong symbolism (bottle as memory) and thematic depth. The ending resonates. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Minor quibble: "grandiose modesty" could be more subtly woven into narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "translucent properties like memories") and nuanced emotion. No AI hallmarks—style is distinct and purposeful. Only flaw: "weirdly static" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Elements serve the story organically. Length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression. Creative fusion of concepts (real estate + souls + music) is masterful.</comment>
