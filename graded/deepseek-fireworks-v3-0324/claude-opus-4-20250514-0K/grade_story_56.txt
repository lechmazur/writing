<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but Marcus's 'energetically lethargic' attribute lacks deeper exploration; Clara's predatory kindness is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the connection between the blank price tag and the computer's restart feels slightly forced.</comment>
