<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivations and development are subtly but effectively conveyed, with her "scrappy" nature and internal conflict over the footprints adding depth. Her voice is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's non-linear structure is handled masterfully, with a clear arc despite time's fluidity. The footprints' mystery drives the narrative forward without feeling forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building; the vacuum garden and backward-flowing time create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (singing shells, crystallized time) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—Mira's rebellion against fate, the garden as metaphor—and literary craft. The ending resonates, though the regular's dialogue occasionally verges on overly cryptic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The time paradoxes feel fresh, and the prose balances poetic precision with clarity. Only minor nitpicks (e.g., "flippant solemnity" could be sharper).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The constraints enhance the story’s surrealism. Leaves the reader pondering time’s fluidity long after.</comment>
