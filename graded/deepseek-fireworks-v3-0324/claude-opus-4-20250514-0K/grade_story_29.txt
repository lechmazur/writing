<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s "cleverly naive" attribute subtly drives her actions, blending curiosity with danger. Her distinct voice and motivation (sabotage) are clear, though her emotional depth could be expanded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent plot with logical cause-and-effect. The jigsaw edge's role and the neutralization arc are well-paced and resolved, though the climax’s mechanics verge on abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the "mystic orchard garden" and "hush of a streetlamp" merge seamlessly with the tonally precise "agonizing bliss." Sensory details (weeping fruit, humming jigsaw) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the Regret Engine, prismatic geysers) and layered subtext about loss. The ending resonates, though the jigsaw's transformation could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoids clichés. The "cryptic frequencies" and "joy-rot sweetness" showcase inventive language. Minor nit: "brass monstrosity" leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story’s theme of reclamation. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for contemplation—wildflowers reclaiming brass is a striking final image.</comment>
