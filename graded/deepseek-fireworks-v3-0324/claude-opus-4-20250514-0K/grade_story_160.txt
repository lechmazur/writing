<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clandestine watchman's motivation and actions are vividly portrayed, with his tactile navigation and defiance of finality revealing a deeply original character. However, his backstory (e.g., grandfather’s goggles) could be more integrated into his present decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the briefcase’s coordinates and the airship’s resurrection forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, though the opera house connection feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay and moonlight-dusted decay are rendered with masterful sensory detail, creating an atmosphere that elevates the story’s emotional and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (goggles, briefcase) and subtext ("endings are pauses") to deliver a resonant, thought-provoking narrative. The ending is particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the tactile navigation and airship resurrection, though "wilderness wisdom" edges toward abstraction. The prose avoids cliché but occasionally over-relies on atmospheric description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative flawlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on transformation.</comment>
