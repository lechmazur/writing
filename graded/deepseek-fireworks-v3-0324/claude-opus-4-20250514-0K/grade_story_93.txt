<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her professional obsession with sacred geometry and personal desperation to save her brother. Her "voice" is distinct, though more internal monologue could deepen her characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from crisis to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the interdimensional logic could be slightly more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Archive and labyrinth settings are vividly realized, with sensory details (humming data, crackling radio) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The elevator farewell is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact and thematic depth, with sacred geometry as both metaphor and plot device. Ending is satisfying, though the "alive geometry" reveal borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal tropes. Some phrases ("infinite song of connection") verge on purple prose, but the core concept feels fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brief length suits the urgency, and the lingering question of the labyrinth's sentience adds depth.</comment>
