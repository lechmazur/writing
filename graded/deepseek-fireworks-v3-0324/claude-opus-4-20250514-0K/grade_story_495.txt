<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivations and personality are vividly rendered, with her "dangerously friendly" nature driving her defiance and yearning for unregulated joy. Her connection to the bread paddle and postcards reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arcs tightly from imprisonment to rebellion, with postcards as a clever device bridging past and future. Pacing is brisk but coherent, though spacetime elements could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary's mechanical birds and eternal twilight create a haunting contrast to the island's wild joy. Sensory details (brass gears, flour-dusted fingers) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (postcards as possible futures) and layered themes (joy as rebellion). The ending is both transcendent and thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative microcosm of rebellion. Every element serves the story’s core, leaving a lingering ache for lost authenticity.</comment>
