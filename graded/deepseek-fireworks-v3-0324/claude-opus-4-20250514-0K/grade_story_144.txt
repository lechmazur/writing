<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chef Marlowe's motivation is clear and compelling, her distinct voice and actions reveal depth, though some travelers could benefit from more individualization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a strong arc, but the street fair backstory feels slightly rushed. Pacing otherwise manages constraints well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere. Sensory details and setting amplify mood and concept; the log flume's decay and interdimensional static are vividly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative and layered, with potent symbolism (music box, stew). Ending is satisfying, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors ("cathedral of rust"). No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. Elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant thematic impact.</comment>
