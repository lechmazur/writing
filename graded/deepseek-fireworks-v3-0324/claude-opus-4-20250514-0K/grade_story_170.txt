<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's development is nuanced, with clear motivation and alignment between her free-spirited nature and inherited doubt. Her "voice" is distinct through actions and reactions to the sewing kit and letters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the letters driving coherent cause-and-effect. Pacing is efficient, though the ending slightly rushes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (salt-stained windows, rusted needles) enhancing the reef's poetic yet scientific setting. Tone and concept harmonize beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (coral as tapestry) and subtext (shame/legacy). Emotional resonance is strong, and the ending satisfies while leaving thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The sewing-coral metaphor feels inventive, and emotions are shown subtly (e.g., trembling fingers). Minor overuse of "hollow echoes."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story’s theme. Length feels deliberate, and the lingering impact of reclaimed legacy lingers.</comment>
