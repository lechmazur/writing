<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Chen's character is vividly drawn, her dual role as cook and spiritual guide is compelling. Her motivation is clear, and her actions align with her established traits. The broken chopstick reveals her resourcefulness and empathy, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The broken chopstick drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between beginning and end is strong, but the word limit constraints show.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submarine setting is immersive and enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (fluorescent buzz, water against steel) are evocative. The atmosphere perfectly supports Mei's role and the theme of chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and literary craft. Symbolism (broken chopstick, cookbook instructions) is deftly handled. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of resilience is richly explored through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Mei's nuanced handling of emotion stands out. The writing style is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate. The story feels fresh, not formulaic.</comment>
