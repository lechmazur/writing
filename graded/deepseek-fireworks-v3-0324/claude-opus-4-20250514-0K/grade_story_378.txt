<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow's accidental mayorship and grumpiness are well-integrated, but his transformation could use more internal conflict to deepen his motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, with the beetle's role and Marlow's sacrifice forming a satisfying arc. Minor tightening of the monks' exposition could improve flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The swamp orchard and polluted water are vividly rendered, with sensory details (apples, ash, mist) enhancing the atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (beetle as transformation, water as memory) and a haunting ending elevate the story. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors avoid clich√©, though the monks' ritual leans slightly archetypal. Voice is distinct and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of accidental purpose resonates.</comment>
