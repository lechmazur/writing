<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus and Elena are well-drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Marcus's "carefree gambler" persona contrasts intriguingly with his trustworthiness, though Elena's depth could be slightly expanded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the island memory thread feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The workshop setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric sensory details that enhance mood. The "hammered repose" tone is achieved masterfully, though the island's connection to the setting could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of subtext and literary devices (e.g., the blueprint as metaphor). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue occasionally edges toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is fresh and purposeful, with nuanced emotion. Minor quibble: "island dreams fading at dawn" verges on overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholic weight.</comment>
