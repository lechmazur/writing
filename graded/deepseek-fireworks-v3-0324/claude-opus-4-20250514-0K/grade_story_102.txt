<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's spinelessness and mercenary background are clear and consistent, driving his actions and reactions. His fear and reluctant curiosity about the key's power are well-portrayed, though his transformation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Thorne's initial reluctance to his unavoidable confrontation with destiny. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect relationships are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The map projection room and the eerie post-storm hush create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (the whispering key, the projected coastlines) deepen the mood and align perfectly with the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using metaphor (the dollhouse key, uncharted horizons) and subtext to evoke thought and emotion. The ending is purposeful, and the dialogue is sharp and natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s with fresh imagery and a unique voice. The handling of emotion and theme is nuanced, and the writing style is distinctive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, with all elements serving the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of unresolved mystery and thematic depth.</comment>
