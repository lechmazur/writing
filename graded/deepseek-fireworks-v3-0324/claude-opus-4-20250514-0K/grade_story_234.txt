<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kenzo's "faithfully unfaithful" nature and xenophile motivation are compelling, but his gentle swordsman persona feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the sundial decoding feels abrupt, and the artifact reveal could use more tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, but the tight word count sacrifices deeper exploration of the artifact's stakes.</comment>
