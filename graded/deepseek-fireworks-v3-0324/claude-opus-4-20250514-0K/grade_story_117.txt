<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the melody driving Meredith's descent and the merging of mosaic realities providing a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-and-effect logic is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cellar's frost-etched cobwebs and ghostly piano create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., shimmering notes, cold floor) deepen the haunting tone, and the setting enhances the theme of trapped creativity.</comment>
