<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus' background as a skeptical gambler subtly informs his methodology, but his transformation into a grief guide could be more explicitly connected to this trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with urgency and coherence maintained despite the word limit. The cause-effect chain (messages → interventions) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm and subway tunnels merge into a haunting, original atmosphere. Sensory details (crumbling petals, flickering lights) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (e.g., grief as chemistry) and literary craft. The ending lingers, though the "frantic peace" duality could be more consistently shown earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice and premise. Minor nitpicks: "drowning in sorrow" leans slightly cliché, but the execution redeems it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant microcosm. The length feels intentional, though Marcus' gambling past could be more integral to his present actions.</comment>
