<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is compelling and consistent, her "clumsily dexterous" nature reflecting her tension between technical precision and emotional turmoil. Her use of silence as retribution reveals her depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect. The silent climax is earned and resonant, though the word limit slightly truncates the mob's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stained glass ear) and subtext (silence as critique). The ending lingers, forcing reflection on communal violence and artistic resistance.</comment>
