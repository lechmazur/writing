<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's complexity and motivation are vividly conveyed, blending her ruthless artistry with intellectual spontaneity. Her actions and dialogue reveal depth, though "ruthless" could be more explicitly tied to her flower arranging.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the road trip and stone circle serving clear purposes. Pacing is excellent, but the transition to the supernatural could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (e.g., humming stones). The moor and stone circle enhance the eerie, intellectual mood flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (Fibonacci sequence, comb as tool/weapon). The ending resonates, though the "watcher" reveal slightly over-explains the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor flaw: "Thursday" as a name feels slightly gimmicky. Metaphors (e.g., "wind chimes in a hurricane") are fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the comb and rock art feel essential. The length is a strength, leaving room for lingering mystery.</comment>
