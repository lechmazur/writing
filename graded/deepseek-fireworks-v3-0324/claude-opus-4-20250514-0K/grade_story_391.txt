<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's roguish yet cautious nature is well-integrated, and his motivation to decode the patterns is clear and compelling. His transformation from outsider to bridge is subtly but effectively shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from discovery to revolution. The word limit is used efficiently, maintaining coherence and pacing without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the piano’s dust vs. the reef’s songs) and subtext (memory as rebellion). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>
