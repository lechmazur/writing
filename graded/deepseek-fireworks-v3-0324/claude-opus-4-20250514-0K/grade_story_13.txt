<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swordsman's solemn demeanor and clear motivation (tracking evolutionary changes) are well-established and drive his actions. His reverent handling of the wooden box and final guardianship reveal depth, though more internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the poems logically guiding the swordsman to the garden. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned. Minor tightening of the lab's chaotic description could enhance coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the "functionally dysfunctional" tower and time distortions create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (broken gears, pollen dust) enrich the setting's paradoxes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (time, extinction) and layered subtext (preservation vs. decay) elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, though a hint of future stakes for the guardian role could deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés. The garden's arcane preservation feels fresh, though "mild fervor" as tone slightly undercuts tension. Language is purposeful, with minimal florid excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically resonant tale. Elements serve the story organically, and the length feels deliberate. Lingers on loss and renewal beautifully.</comment>
