<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's dual identity as a physician and archaeologist is compelling, but her transition from burnout to revelation feels slightly rushed. Her motivation is clear, though her "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elena's discoveries, but the tight word limit forces abrupt leaps (e.g., coffee grounds to cutlass). Pacing is efficient but could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nomadic camp and temple ruins are vividly contrasted, though the "dire enchantment" tone clashes mildly with the modern setting. Sensory details (coffee, murky depths) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glyphs as medical formulas) and subtext (healing vs. knowledge). Ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of archaeology and medicine avoids clich√©s, though the pirate element risks tropiness. Language is purposeful, but a few phrases ("pewter line") feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the nomadic camp feels underutilized. The story lingers intellectually, though emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>
