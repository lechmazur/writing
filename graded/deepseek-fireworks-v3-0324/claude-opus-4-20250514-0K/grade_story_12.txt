<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong character development; Maya's aloofness and cartographer background effectively shape her actions and perspective. Elena's motivations are clear and nuanced, reflecting their shared history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc; the cracked tile and kayaking simulation logically drive the reunion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the futuristic mall feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but the futuristic setting clashes subtly with the intimate, memory-driven tone. Sensory details (cracked tile, holographic rivers) are well-chosen but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (tile as map, river as memory). Emotional resonance is high, and the ending is poignant. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose. Metaphors (cracks as growth rings) are fresh. Nuanced handling of sisterly tension elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically layered. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Lingers on memory and reconciliation, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
