<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's ambivalence and prophetic vision are compelling, but Chen feels underdeveloped as a foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly paced with a clear arc, though the "final oath" resolution could be more explicitly tied to earlier puzzle edges.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lunar Station Seven's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending cosmic awe with mining grit. The cracked marbles refracting light is a standout detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (cosmic scoreboard, fragmented reality) and a hauntingly ambiguous ending. Dialogue sharpens character dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-clich√© take on prophecy tropes. "Happily sad" and "bashful arrogance" inject nuanced humanity into high-concept themes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a story that feels expansive despite its brevity. The marbles-as-universal-code conceit lingers in the mind.</comment>
