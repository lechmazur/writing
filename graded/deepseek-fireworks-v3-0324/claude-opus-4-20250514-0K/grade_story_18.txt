<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara's telepathic consciousness and silent observation create a compelling, distinct character. Her motivation to find truth is clear and drives the narrative, though her immobility slightly limits active development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the hair tie serving as a clever catalyst. Pacing is strong, though the committee's subplot feels slightly underdeveloped due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk atmosphere is vivid and immersive, seamlessly blending with the statue's timeless perspective. Sensory details (oxidized bronze, hissing steam) enhance mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hair tie as truth-token) and subtext. The ending is poignant and resonant, with subtle emotional impact. Writing style elevates the story beyond its word count.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes; the statue's perspective feels uniquely human despite her form.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich narrative where every element serves the story. Leaves a lingering meditation on truth and legacy.</comment>
