<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brother Cornelius is vividly portrayed with clear, consistent motivation, but his "unhinged" nature could be more sharply defined to avoid ambiguity between zealotry and madness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the bottle cap's significance, though the transition to confession feels slightly abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The jungle-parlor fusion is brilliantly unsettling, with sensory details (humidity, peeling wallpaper) amplifying the absurdity perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (cosmic truth whispers, chandelier dripping) elevate the theme, but the ending's dance resolution risks undercutting the tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (cola-ad divine vision) and nuanced absurdity. Minor overuse of "unspoken agreements."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the tight word limit slightly strains the interplay of elements. Lingers provocatively on chaos vs. order.</comment>
