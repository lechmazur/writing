<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and nuanced, evolving from professional curiosity to reluctant complicity. Her "carefully careless" demeanor mirrors Mrs. Ashford's, revealing layers of control and survival. The dogs' transformation underscores her shift from walker to keeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot coheres tightly, with the botanical collection and blood-drive encounter escalating tension logically. Pacing is masterful—each detail (the dogs' behavior, the accelerated sunset) builds toward the chilling reveal. No wasted words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The mansion's haunted reputation is subverted brilliantly; the true horror lies in the Ashfords' cultivated illusions. Sensory details (crystal teeth, shifting leaves) heighten dread. Atmosphere and setting are inseparable from the story's core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the "loud silence" metaphor, the plants leaning like hungry observers, the signature as a Faustian bargain. Subtext about class and complicity lingers. Ending is both resolution and ominous beginning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and unsettling. Tropes (haunted mansion, blood rituals) are reinvented through Margot's perspective. Prose is precise yet evocative—no clichés. The Afghans as "smoke" and the plants' "watercolor" hues feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm of gothic horror and socio-economic critique. Every element serves the whole. The brevity amplifies its power, leaving the reader haunted by unspoken implications.</comment>
