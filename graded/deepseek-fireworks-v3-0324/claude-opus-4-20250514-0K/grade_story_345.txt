<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from a lapsed priest to someone embracing confusion is compelling and well-developed, with his actions and reflections consistently aligned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with footprints and abacus serving as effective catalysts. Pacing is brisk but manages a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard and celestial bean stalks create a haunting, surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements Marcus's existential crisis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices and subtext; the ending is both ambiguous and thematically resonant. Writing elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original; avoids tropes and clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., abacus as absent prayers) are fresh and precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
