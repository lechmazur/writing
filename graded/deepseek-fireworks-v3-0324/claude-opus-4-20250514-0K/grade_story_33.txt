<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His blend of fragility and defiance is compelling, though his birdwatcher trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is taut and coherent, with a clear arc. The cosmic blink frames the action elegantly, though the resolution leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (porcelain shards, mercury-like marble) amplifying the mood. The leaf office is a brilliant contrast to chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (mask, leaves), evocative prose, and a haunting ending. The theme of chaos vs. order resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The "braided bitterness" tone avoids clich√©, though the birdwatcher angle feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering existential question.</comment>
