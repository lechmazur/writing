<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's earnestness and knightly duty are clear, but his emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped. His motivation (saving the frozen north) is strong but could benefit from more personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's mechanics (water flowing magically) could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The worldbuilding is stellar—evocative sensory details (crumbling stone, phantom roses) immerse the reader. The ruined aqueduct and greenhouse settings intertwine seamlessly with the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (Phoenix, constellations) and layered themes (rebirth, memory) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional payoff could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("déjà vu reversed") verge on overly ornate. The core idea (magic encoded in architecture) feels fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, elegant vignette. The elements serve the story beautifully, and the constrained length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
