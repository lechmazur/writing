<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brother Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, blending spiritual and technological rebellion. His actions align with his quest for enlightenment, and his "voice" is distinct, though deeper introspection could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot's cohesion is impressive for its brevity, with a clear arc from revelation to transcendence. Pacing is tight but purposeful, though the climax could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sky burial site and cyber-spiritual fusion create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (smoking leather, disrupted data-streams) are razor-sharp and elevate the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "reflecting lightning back at the storm") and thematic depth. The ending is both satisfying and provocative, though the prose occasionally veers into over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with minimal clich√©s and fresh, nuanced metaphors. The blend of techno-mysticism and human frailty feels authentically innovative, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette that leverages its constraints elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering existential weight.</comment>
