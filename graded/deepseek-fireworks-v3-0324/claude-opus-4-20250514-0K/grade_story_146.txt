<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zelena’s transition from fraud to genuine seer is compelling, but her internal conflict ("peaceful anger") could be explored more deeply to solidify her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic, though the pacing slightly rushes the discovery of the bone flute.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive and crypt are vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, crumbling ivy) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story’s mystical tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flute, lost languages) and a haunting ending elevate the narrative. Subtext about hidden knowledge and destiny is masterfully woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("visions bloomed like thorns"). Occasional phrases ("peaceful anger") verge on contrived but mostly avoid cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense story where every element serves the whole. The length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
