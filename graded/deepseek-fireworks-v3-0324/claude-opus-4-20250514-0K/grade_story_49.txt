<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's lukewarm magic and loyalty to the dead are vividly realized, driving her actions and emotional arc. Her motivation to paint a future free from fear is clear and evolves organically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's progression from grief to resolution is tightly woven, with the fog-machine method serving as a coherent and poignant vehicle for memory. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar base's sterile, metallic atmosphere contrasts powerfully with Elara's magic and the doormat's tactile nostalgia. Sensory details (recycled air, frayed edges) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (doormat as lost home) and subtext (lukewarm magic as emotional stasis). The ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice, with fresh metaphors ("constellations of loss") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés and AI tropes, maintaining a distinct, purposeful style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, elegiac gem. The elements serve the story’s depth, not vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, and the conclusion lingers with haunting clarity.</comment>
