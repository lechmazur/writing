<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. The photograph serves as a powerful anchor for his character and reveals layers of his desperation and determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The ending's ambiguity hints at resolution without over-explaining, though the word limit slightly rushes the final revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered, with sensory details (recycled water, blood-red blooms) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting contrasts sharply with Marcus's Earth-bound longing, amplifying tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, withering control) and subtext. The "serene anger" tone is maintained expertly, though the ending’s emotional payoff could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés. Marcus’s defiance feels fresh, and the lunar resistance backdrop is distinctive. Some phrases ("water these plants as a free man") verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements integrate seamlessly, though the "timely rebirth" concept slightly strains the resolution’s plausibility.</comment>
