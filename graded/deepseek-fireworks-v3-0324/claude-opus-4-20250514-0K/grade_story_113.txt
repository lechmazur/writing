<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Melody's reluctance and grief are palpable, her motivation clear and deeply personal. The dinosaur plush serves as a powerful emotional anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with time-fracturing adding complexity without confusion. Pacing is superb for the word limit, and the ending resolves elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and apocalyptic 2089 setting are vivid and immersive. Sensory details (ash, humming lights) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (dinosaur, tapestry) and layered themes (fragility vs. strength). The ending lingers with poetic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich gem. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for contemplation.</comment>
