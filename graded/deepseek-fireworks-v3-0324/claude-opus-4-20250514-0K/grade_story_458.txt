<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, her actions aligned with her role as a preserver of tradition, and her internal conflict is well-articulated. The button as a symbolic object adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and high-stakes decision point. Pacing is exceptional for the word count, and cause-and-effect logic is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and fractal sorrow atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (steam, echoes, brass button) enhancing immersion. Setting and tone reinforce theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (button, coffee stains), layered themes (preservation vs. risk), and evocative prose. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The coffee-stain divination is inventive, and emotional nuance is shown rather than told. No AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exemplary cohesion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind. A standout piece with clear depth.</comment>
