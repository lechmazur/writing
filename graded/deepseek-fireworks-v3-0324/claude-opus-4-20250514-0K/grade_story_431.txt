<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's introversion and dancer background are well-integrated, driving her actions and reactions with consistency. Her motivation to escape is clear and aligns with her established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with knitting and celestial decoding forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The desolate wasteland and decoder's office are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (old paper, knitting sounds) deepen immersion and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (scarf as code, stars as choreography) and a satisfying, thematic ending. The prose is elegant, and the conflict (escape vs. stasis) is resonant.</comment>
