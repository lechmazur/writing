<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Captain Reeves' isolation and resigned caretaker role are vividly portrayed, with her "warmly aloof" demeanor and fixation on "what ifs" adding depth. Her motivation to escape temporal limbo is clear and drives the narrative forward.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cosmic dust and dial tone subtly foreshadowing the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the resolution’s suddenness slightly undercuts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold’s eerie stasis and cosmic dust outside create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (chalk squeaks, phantom dial tones) immerse the reader in Reeves’ timeless prison.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (chalk marks, clouds as a "key") and subtext about time’s fluidity. The ending’s emotional payoff—letting go of regret—is profound and memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Refreshingly original twist on time loops and space pirates. Reeves’ voice avoids clichés, and the prose balances poetic precision with emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem that transcends its constraints. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind long after reading.</comment>
