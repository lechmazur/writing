<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara is vividly realized—her age, pragmatism, and reluctant transformation into a prophet feel organic. Her motivation (bearing witness to the end) is compelling and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot builds tension masterfully, with clear cause/effect (spyglass discovery → cosmic revelation → futile warnings). Pacing balances urgency and contemplation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and dying city create a haunting contrast; cosmic decay bleeds into the setting. Sensory details (salt-crusted lens, withered vines) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—metaphors (cosmic scaffolding, roots cracking concrete) elevate prose. The ending resonates with philosophical weight, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original. No clichés; fresh phrasing (e.g., "universe's late-blooming hero"). Nuanced emotion (reluctance, awe) avoids exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story’s cohesion. The length feels intentional, and the lingering question of cosmic finality is profound.</comment>
