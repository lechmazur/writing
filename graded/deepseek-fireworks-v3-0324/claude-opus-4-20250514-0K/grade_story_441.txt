<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mikhail's quantum-entangled perception and philosopher background are vividly portrayed, but his "usually unusual" attribute could be more deeply explored to clarify his uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flash mob as a plot device is inventive but slightly abrupt; the resolution with Elena, however, ties the arc together elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accelerator's hum and liminal "between bus routes" timeframe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that elevates the story's melancholy core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of stamps as symbols of fractured history and quantum loneliness. The ending’s quiet resonance lingers, though the flash mob’s execution risks slight contrivance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (stamps as "prayer beads"), nuanced emotion, and a distinct voice avoid AI pitfalls. Only minor over-reliance on "quantum" as a thematic crutch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with the stamps and accelerator serving the theme beautifully. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
