<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maeve's "strongly weak" attribute is vividly portrayed through her trembling hands and fierce spirit. Her motivation to document the unseen is clear and consistent, reinforced by her actions and the ink pot's significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively from the game's intrusion to Maeve's revelation, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight yet purposeful, though the ending slightly rushes the thematic climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere blending digital and ancient Celtic elements. Sensory details (glowing smartphones, warm ink pot) immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies the story's eerie, liminal tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink pot, threads of courage) and a haunting theme of cultural collision elevate the narrative. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, with fresh metaphors ("digital mushrooms"). Minor AI-like phrasing in descriptions of despair, but the voice feels distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about modernityâ€™s cost to history. Only lacks slight polish for "flawless" status.</comment>
