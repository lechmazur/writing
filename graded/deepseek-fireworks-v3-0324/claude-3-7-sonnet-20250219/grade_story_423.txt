<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Galahad's earnestness and connection to his grandfather are well-established, but his "unknowingly familiar" trait could be more deeply explored to enhance his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the greenhouse tears serving as a clever pivot. Pacing is excellent, though the transition from desert to ice land could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined aqueduct and greenhouse create a vivid, atmospheric setting. Sensory details (water droplets, moonlight) are used masterfully to reinforce the theme of hidden guidance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars, water, maps) and a resonant ending elevate the story. The theme of inherited wisdom is subtly powerful, though the "canvas of life" metaphor feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "crisp nostalgia" tone occasionally veers into sentimentality. The mapping method is inventive, though the ice-land questâ€™s logic stretches plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The interplay of elements feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
