<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartholomew's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "solemnly silly" nature and connection to the straw revealing depth. His actions align well with his ghostly caretaker role and obsession with animal communication.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the straw and logs driving the narrative logically. The ending feels earned, and pacing is well-managed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen orchard with geothermal streams is vividly rendered, enhancing the ghostly atmosphere. Sensory details (misty breath, crackling logs) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (straw as tether, geothermal life beneath frost) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of connection resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The straw’s mundanity as a ghostly anchor is inventive, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, lingering effect. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
