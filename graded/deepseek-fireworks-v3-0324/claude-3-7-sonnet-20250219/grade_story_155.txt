<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear contradictions (patiently impatient) and motivations (inherited mystery, desire for power). His underwater welding skill is both unique and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the button box and celestial alignment driving the narrative toward a decisive moment. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The broken planetarium-turned-nightclub is a masterstroke of atmosphere, blending decay and luxury. Sensory details (light-refracting discs, fractured constellations) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mending worlds like metal), evocative prose, and a haunting ending elevate this beyond surface plot. The theme of choice and duality lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés. The underwater welder’s duality and the button box’s mechanics feel fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity enhances the story’s potency, leaving a resonant question: Which path will Elias choose?</comment>
