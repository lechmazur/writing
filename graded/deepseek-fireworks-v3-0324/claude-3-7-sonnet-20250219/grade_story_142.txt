<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Percival's motivation is clear and consistent, with his aristocratic past and current desperation driving his actions. His "realistically odd" conviction about the pocket dimension adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the botanical illustration and roller coaster serving as effective catalysts. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (creaking wood, whispers) enhancing the atmosphere. The blurry vividness of the illustration ties beautifully into the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the melody as legacy) and subtext (wealth as balance). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The pocket dimension twist is inventive, though the "broke aristocrat" trope is slightly predictable. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering meditation on intangible wealth.</comment>
