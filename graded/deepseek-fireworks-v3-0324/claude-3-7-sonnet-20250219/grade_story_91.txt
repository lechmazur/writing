<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot unfolds organically, with a logical progression from suspicion to revelation. The tight word limit is used efficiently, though the confrontation scene could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant, with weather serving as both setting and metaphor. Sensory details (rain, lightning) enhance the eerie yet harmonious tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (fedora, tuning) and subtext (beauty vs. weaponization). The ending lingers, leaving room for reflection on nature and artifice.</comment>
