<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his smuggler's caution with a deeper existential quest. His "meticulously impulsive" nature is well-illustrated, though his transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to revelation. The confined timeframe (17 minutes) heightens tension, and the ending resolves while leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The drought center and medical wing provide functional but underutilized atmosphere. The butterfly watch is a vivid anchor, but the setting lacks deeper integration with the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (butterfly, synesthesia) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally and intellectually, elevating the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of smuggling empathy is fresh, and the prose balances precision with lyricism. Minor quibble: "enthusiastic apathy" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
