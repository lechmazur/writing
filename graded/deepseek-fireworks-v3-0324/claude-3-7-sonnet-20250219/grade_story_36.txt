<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His "faithfully odd" nature and calm doomsayer persona drive his actions convincingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from reflection to decisive action. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the steampunk elements feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and sunrise setting are evocative but could be more deeply integrated. Sensory details (e.g., train whistle, dust motes) enhance atmosphere effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (skateboard as memory, wings as defiance) and a resonant ending elevate the story. Subtext about resilience and renewal is skillfully woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "slam a door on the gods of stagnation") avoid clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically potent whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
