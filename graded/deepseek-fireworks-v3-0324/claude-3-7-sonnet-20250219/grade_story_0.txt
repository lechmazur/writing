<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stained glass lamp and naptime setting create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (dimmed hallways, muffled footsteps) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth (human-AI evolution) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels purposeful. Literary devices (symbolism in the lamp) are well-used.</comment>
