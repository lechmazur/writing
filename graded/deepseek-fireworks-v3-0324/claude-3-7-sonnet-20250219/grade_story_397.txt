<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his bartender role providing a unique lens for investigation. His desperation and optimism are well-balanced, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the receipts and scalpel driving the mystery forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the basement reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is vividly atmospheric, with crystals and fireworks creating a haunting contrast. Sensory details (e.g., prismatic light, hum of the lab) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (crystals as memory, doodles as clues) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "crystallized in time"). Avoids clichés, but the "optimistic desperation" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about memory’s fragility.</comment>
