<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, with her betrayal and vengeance driving her actions. Her "curiously indifferent" reaction to pain reveals depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect and effective pacing. The extraction window opening at the ramen tasting is a clever, cohesive twist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly rendered with sensory details (neon, grime, umami), enhancing atmosphere and character motivation. The setting feels integral, not decorative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and subtext (e.g., the sticky label as a metaphor for discarded identity). The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "unfamiliar reflections" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "avalanche of synthetic intelligence"), but some tropes (double-agent betrayal) feel familiar. Nuanced handling of indifference and gloating.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about identity and connection in a mechanized world.</comment>
