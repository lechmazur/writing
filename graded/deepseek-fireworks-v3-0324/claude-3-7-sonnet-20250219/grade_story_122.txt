<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's cyber-templar identity and motivation are clear, but his internal conflict could be deeper. The bridle as a keepsake adds emotional weight, but his "patiently frantic" state feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the lightning refraction method borders on technobabble. Pacing is excellent, and cause-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lightning, rain, vultures) enhance the mood, though the prism's integration could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bridle, prism) and thematic depth ("mirage of safety"). The ending is satisfying, but the euphoric agitation tone occasionally clashes with the solemn setting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the cyber-templar concept risks genre tropes. The prose is purposeful, but some phrases ("euphoric agitation") feel forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
