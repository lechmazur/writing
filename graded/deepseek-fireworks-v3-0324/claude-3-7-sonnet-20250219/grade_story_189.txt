<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "uniquely literal" mind driving her methodical decoding. Her brazen calm and indifference to ghosts reveal a focused, pragmatic personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression from decoding to discovery. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (worn key, whispers, blue light) enhancing atmosphere. The setting actively supports the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key as conductor, ghosts as guides) and subtext (hope amid scarcity) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The phone booth key and star-map premise feel inventive, and the prose avoids AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, offering both emotional and intellectual payoff.</comment>
