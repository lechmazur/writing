<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized—his no-nonsense empathy and blacksmith’s rhythm align perfectly with his role as humanity’s last keeper. His motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost’s introduction borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted dollhouse museum is a masterclass in atmosphere—evocative, eerie, and thematically rich. Sensory details (hammering, trembling glass) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship. The story’s emotional weight, layered symbolism (heartbeat as humanity’s pulse), and haunting prose elevate it beyond the surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original. Avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("voice the rustle of pages in a book no one would ever read") and nuanced emotion. No AI tells detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant gem. Every element serves the story’s depth, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache of loss and preservation.</comment>
