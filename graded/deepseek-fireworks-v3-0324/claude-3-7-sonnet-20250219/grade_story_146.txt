<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "peaceful anger" risks clich√©. Avoids AI tropes convincingly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, though the word limit slightly truncates the flute's lore. Leaves a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
