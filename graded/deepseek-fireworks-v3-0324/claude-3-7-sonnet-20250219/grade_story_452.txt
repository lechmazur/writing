<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's softhearted nature and refusal of neural enhancements are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "champion" status could be more explicitly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. The midnight planetarium visits and cosmic rewriting are inventive yet coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and planetarium contrast brilliantly, with evocative sensory details (neon, hum of AI) enhancing the atmosphere. The "end of storytelling" concept deepens the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (buckle, stars) and subtext (humanity vs. algorithms). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of rewriting destiny lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The belt buckle's role is fresh, and the muted euphoria tone is nuanced. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, and the cosmic-signature twist elevates it beyond typical cyberpunk.</comment>
