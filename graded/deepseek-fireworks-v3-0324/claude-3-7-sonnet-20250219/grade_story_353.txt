<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and compelling, blending her mundane profession with a grand, time-spanning mission. Her "cynically gentle" hands hint at depth, though more nuance in her emotional reactions would elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action driving toward the climax. The time-travel mechanics are coherent, though the moon-tracking subplot feels slightly underdeveloped for its weight in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (dough, moonlight, whispers) enhancing the mystical tone. The gas station-turned-time-machine garage is a standout, blending mundane and fantastical seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flowers, bread, shadows) and subtext (time as dough to be kneaded). The ending is satisfyingly thematic, though the Mayor's defeat could benefit from more visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of baking and time travel feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Only minor quibbles: the mechanic's dialogue leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions about time and tyranny.</comment>
