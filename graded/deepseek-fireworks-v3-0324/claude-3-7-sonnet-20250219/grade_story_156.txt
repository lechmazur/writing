<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending diplomatic duty with personal introspection. Her "joyfully tragic" perspective adds depth, though her "confused" nature could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bus rides and bird observations elegantly driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the salt mine's governance shift could use slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (crystalline caverns, warm light) enhancing the story's mood. The eerie yet communal vibe perfectly supports the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the spare key, murmurations) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though a touch more emotional weight in Eliza's final act would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "evolutionary wisdom" angle is inventive, though the "boldly timid" tone occasionally wavers into overt hesitancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on natural systems vs. human constructs.</comment>
