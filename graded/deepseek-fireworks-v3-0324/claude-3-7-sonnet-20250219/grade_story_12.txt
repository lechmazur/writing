<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' aloofness and emotional detachment are well-established, but his motivation to map emotional topography feels slightly underdeveloped. The cracked tile and kayaking ads effectively reveal his hidden longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the timeline convergence concept feels rushed. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could benefit from more space to breathe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic mall is vividly rendered, and the contrast between clinical precision and emotional resonance is striking. Holographic ads and temporal shifts enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tile, kayaking) and subtext, but the emotional payoff leans slightly toward telling. The ending is satisfying but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The cracked tile metaphor is fresh, and the tone balances melancholy with subtle hope. Some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story rather than feeling forced. The brevity works, though the timeline mechanics could be more fully explored.</comment>
