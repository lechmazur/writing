<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and nuanced, particularly Elara's contradiction of being "faithfully unfaithful." Takeshi's late-bloomer arc is compelling but could delve deeper into his swordsman identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the microchip reveal feels slightly abrupt. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Museum setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's tension and thematic weight. Sensory details (e.g., fossilized ribcages, emergency lights) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sword reflecting light, matchbox as vessel for secrets). Ending lingers with poetic resonance, though dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cradle the universe"). Minor AI-esque phrasing in Takeshi's introspection, but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. Length feels deliberate, with thematic depth outweighing word constraints.</comment>
