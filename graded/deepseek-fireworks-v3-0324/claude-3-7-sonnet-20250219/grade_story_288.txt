<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear motivation and depth, though his "professionally wild" attribute could be more explicitly shown in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the quarantine's resolution feels slightly rushed. The sculpture subplot ties the arc together elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ozone station setting is richly atmospheric, though the paddleboarding detail feels underutilized. Sensory details (flag, sculpture) enhance immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
