<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, blending curiosity with a desire for legacy. Her "perfectly flawed" nature adds depth, though her transition from librarian to world-dismantler could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. The word limit is well-managed, though the climax feels slightly rushed. The connection between beginning and end is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (honey cakes, shifting glyphs) enhancing atmosphere. The canyon setting and portals are expertly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (grace as energy, honey cakes as pact). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors (grace "like honey from a comb") and nuanced emotion. The librarian-turned-legend twist is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. The story lingers beyond its final line.</comment>
