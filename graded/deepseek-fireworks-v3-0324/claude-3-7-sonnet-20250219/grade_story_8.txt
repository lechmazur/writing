<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Everett's motivation is clear and compelling, blending aristocratic rebellion with intellectual pursuit. His actions align well with his "empirically rebellious" nature, though his "dazed" state could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness within the tight word limit. The connection between quantum mechanics and mythology is intriguing, though the pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe ("between lectures") work well together, though the garden's "nexus point" function could be more explicitly tied to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (chalk, garden instruments) and subtext effectively. The ending is purposeful, leaving room for reflection. The theme of logic vs. madness is explored with nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and demonstrates originality, though some phrases ("cosmic dance") verge on overused. The handling of emotion is subtle, and the style is distinct, avoiding AI-like predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brief length works to its advantage, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
