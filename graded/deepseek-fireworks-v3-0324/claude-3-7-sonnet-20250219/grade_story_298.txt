<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin Wei's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into his character, with his "rationally impulsive" approach adding nuance. His transformation into the Empress and his cold-case performances reveal a compelling duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Lin's performance serving as a natural climax. The connection between past and present is seamless, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-petroleum Forbidden City is vividly rendered, with synthetic bamboo and atmospheric debris enhancing the eerie, adaptive tone. Sensory details (dust particles, sunlight) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the doll's dress, sunlight as truth) and subtext (illusion vs. reality). The ending is poignant, leaving room for reflection on historical closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of futuristic decay and traditional theater feels fresh, and Lin's emotional complexity avoids AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the brevity feeling intentional. The story lingers, questioning the nature of truth in a synthetic world.</comment>
