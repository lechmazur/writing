<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viktor's transformation is compelling, but his initial motivation as a "nervous kingpin" feels slightly underdeveloped. The seed pods and heritage revelation deepen his character effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the detour and gardens serving as pivotal moments. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the xenophobic enclave aspect could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Midwinter and the mill's atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension. The gardens' symbolism is particularly strong, though "xenophobic enclave" lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seed pods, gardens) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "tyranny of indifference" phrase feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (seed pods as worry beads). Minor clich√©s ("fragile ferocity") and the xenophobia element could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
