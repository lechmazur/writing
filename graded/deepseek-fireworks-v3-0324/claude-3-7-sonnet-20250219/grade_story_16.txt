<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jack's motivation is clear and consistent, with his freelancer nature and newfound purpose well-integrated. His "voice" is distinct, though slightly more internal reflection could deepen his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the cipher resolution could be slightly more detailed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The engine room and wedding aftermath are meaningfully connected to Jack's introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber ring, rhythmic engines) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though a touch more subtext in the dialogue (if expanded) could heighten impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though one or two metaphors ("waves against a cliff") verge on overused. Emotional resonance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
