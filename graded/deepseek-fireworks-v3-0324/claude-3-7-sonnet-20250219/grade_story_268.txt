<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's subdued nature and vigilante role are deeply integrated with his motivation and actions. The wooden bead and his "artfully clumsy" demeanor reveal layers of deception and resilience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the funhouse mirror and virtual calls driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere that amplifies the character's isolation and the story's tension. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext. The ending lingers, and the conflict—internal and external—is razor-sharp. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with no clichés. The "artfully clumsy" motif and the bead's dual purpose are fresh. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lasting impression of quiet rebellion.</comment>
