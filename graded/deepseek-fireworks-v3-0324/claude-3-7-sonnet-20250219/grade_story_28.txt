<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with her family legacy and personal drive effectively shaping her actions. Her "sly" attribute is subtly demonstrated in her fork maneuver.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle box and fork retrieval creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (fork recovery) could be slightly more tense.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant. Hollow headlights and metallic graveyard imagery enhance the atmosphere of forgotten lore.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and emotional resonance, though some metaphors (e.g., "water through cupped hands") verge on clich√©. Ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh details (tarnished fork as a tool). Minimal AI tells; only minor stiffness in phrasing (e.g., "desperate optimism giving way to momentary panic").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the length feels deliberate. Lingers on the tension between preservation and loss, though the resolution is somewhat neat.</comment>
