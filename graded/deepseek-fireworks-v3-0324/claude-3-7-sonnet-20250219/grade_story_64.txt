<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but Mara's role feels slightly underdeveloped. His "uncertain" nature is subtly shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight yet effective; the tribunal's looming decision adds urgency. The ending resolves cleanly while leaving room for imagination.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details (creaking balloons, iridescent scale). Atmosphere perfectly supports the theme of transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong subtext about knowledge vs. immortality. The "mundane miracle" twist is memorable. Literary devices (symbolism of scrubbed floor) elevate the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original take on immortality tropes. No clich√©s; metaphors (e.g., "sunset compressed into seconds") feel fresh. Nuanced handling of purpose vs. eternal life.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, ending lingers. Combines fantasy and philosophical depth with rare elegance.</comment>
