<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's bruised fighter persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His internal conflict and realization are well-developed, though his "skillfully incompetent" trait could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from confrontation to revelation. The dream abduction method is inventive, and pacing is excellent for the word limit. Minor coherence hiccups in transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic setting and clockwork animals create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, light, mechanical sounds) enhance mood. The setting deeply supports the theme and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (clay shard, clockwork animals) and subtext. The ending is poignant and resonant. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes. Style is distinctive, though the "close distance" tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. Creative and deliberate in its brevity. Leaves a lingering emotional and thematic impression.</comment>
