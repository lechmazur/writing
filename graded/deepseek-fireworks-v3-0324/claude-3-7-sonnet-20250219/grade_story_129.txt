<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in generational trauma, but his "steadily unpredictable" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from burden to release. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "torpedo" action feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—launch site and twilight atmosphere amplify the theme of abandoned dreams. Sensory details (rusted gantries, tarnished ring) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling is layered with potent symbolism (ring, tablecloths) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying, though the "hushed euphoria" tone could be more consistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the tablecloth method and launch site setting, but some phrases ("weight of generations") edge toward cliché. Nuanced handling of emotion avoids AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative. Brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on inherited shadows.</comment>
