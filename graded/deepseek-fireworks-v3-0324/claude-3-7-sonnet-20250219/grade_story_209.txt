<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elijah's grief and motivation are deeply intertwined, with his actions and dialogue revealing a nuanced, authentic character. His "despairing cheer" voice is distinct and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the short-circuit and letter revelation serving as a pivotal, organic turning point. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
