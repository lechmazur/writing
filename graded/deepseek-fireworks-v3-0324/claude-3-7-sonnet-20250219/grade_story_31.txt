<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Mei are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Elias's solemnity and Mei's youthful frustration are well-balanced, though Mei's transformation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from isolation to connection. The key's reveal and the organic network concept are seamlessly integrated, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk garden setting is brilliantly evoked, with sensory details that contrast the organic and technological. The rooftop orchard's rebellion against the cityscape is a standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the key, seeds, networks) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, and the dialogue feels natural. Only minor tightening of thematic resonance could push it to perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The cyberpunk-meets-agrarian twist feels fresh, though a few phrases ("electric god") border on overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering theme of organic connection is deeply resonant.</comment>
