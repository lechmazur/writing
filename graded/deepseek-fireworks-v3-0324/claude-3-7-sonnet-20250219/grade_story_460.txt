<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is compellingly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His royal past contrasts poignantly with his current survivalist state, and his actions align with his quest for meaning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from despair to hope. The feather's method is inventive, and pacing balances urgency with reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid rain forest is vividly rendered, with sensory details (sizzling droplets, mutated banyan) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the stakes and Elias's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (puzzle pieces, feather) and layered themes (fragmentation vs. hope) elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The feather's tactile magic and the "lethargically energetic" state feel fresh. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth and evocative imagery.</comment>
