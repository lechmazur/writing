<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with her artistic struggles and epiphany well-integrated into her character. Her "voice" is distinct, though slightly more internal reflection could deepen her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from rejection to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "implode" metaphor could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with fossilized bones and the puzzle ring creating a rich symbolic backdrop. Sensory details (light, texture, sound) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (ring as artistic struggle, bones as transformation) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the cello note feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The "excited boredom" nuance is fresh, though the "boundaries of light" phrase borders on over-poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story’s theme of transformation. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
