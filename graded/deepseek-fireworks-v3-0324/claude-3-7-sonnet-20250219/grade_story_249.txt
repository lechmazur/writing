<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his lazily ambitious nature with his grandfather's legacy. His unmasked vigilante persona adds depth, though his transition could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Marcus's introspection to his plan for Mrs. Abernathy. The barbershop quartet as an intelligence network is inventive but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is vividly rendered, with evocative sensory details (rain, verdigris statues) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Marcus's mission and the story's whimsical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., suspended raindrops as "crystal lenses") enrich the narrative. The theme of preserving joy is poignant, though the ending's emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The dentist's drill and games collection are fresh, but the "hidden whimsy" tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering reflection on preservation and joy, though some concepts (e.g., resilience) could be tighter.</comment>
