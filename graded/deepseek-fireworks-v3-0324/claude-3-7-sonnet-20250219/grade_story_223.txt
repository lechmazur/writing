<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harlow's seasickness and naval background subtly inform his actions and voice, but his "awkwardly charming" trait feels underdeveloped in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the orchid's transformation serving as a clear climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the traded secrets backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon are vividly rendered, with sensory details (mineral dust, opalescent light) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting is inseparable from the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, orchid) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though Harlow's emotional arc could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("ancient promises," "glacial patience") edge toward clich√©. The ghost orchid concept is strikingly fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
