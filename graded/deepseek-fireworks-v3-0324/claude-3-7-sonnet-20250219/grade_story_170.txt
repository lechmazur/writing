<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her academic past and emotional turmoil. Her actions align well with her "academically artistic" attribute, though her "free-spirited" nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from retreat to resolution. The pacing is effective, and the cause-and-effect relationships (shame → flight → rediscovery) are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coral restoration station is vividly rendered, with sensory details (weathered coral, bioluminescence) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly mirrors Elara's isolation and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and literary craft. The grandmother's letters and sewing kit serve as potent symbols, and the ending is both satisfying and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "hollow echoes of shame"). The handling of doubt and shame avoids cliché, though some phrasing leans slightly toward the ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of reclaiming voice lingers powerfully.</comment>
