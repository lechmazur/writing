<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Galen's jovial yet cautious nature is well-developed, and his motivation (resolving doubt about his sister) is clear and compelling. His reluctance to fully enter the garden adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to purpose. The time capsule ritual drives the story forward logically, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's garden is vividly rendered with sensory details (rosemary, nightshade, whispering plants). The atmosphere perfectly balances danger and mysticism, enhancing the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (telescope, locket) and layered subtext (doubt vs. vengeance) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "withering vow" concept and Galen's nuanced emotions feel authentic, not formulaic. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. A standout piece with polish and cohesion.</comment>
