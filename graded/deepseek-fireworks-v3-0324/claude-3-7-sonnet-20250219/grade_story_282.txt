<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gideon's brashness and dedication to preservation are clear, but his "consciously wild" attribute could be more deeply explored to fully justify his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from forge to store feels slightly abrupt. The ending ties back effectively to the beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forge and discount store settings are vividly contrasted, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (dust, light, heat) are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nautilus, medal) and subtext about preservation. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "detonating the past"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "dusty exuberance" tone occasionally feels strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thought about preservation and legacy.</comment>
