<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, with her dutiful nature and hidden hunger for authenticity driving her actions. The glove and voice notes reveal her complex relationship with Madame.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each voice note logically advancing the mystery. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the final reveal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theater's eerie silence and decaying grandeur are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details (the glove's texture, the sanctuary's hush) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the glove as legacy) and subtext (theater as metaphor for life). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. Madame's scavenger hunt feels fresh, though the "dying diva" trope is lightly present. The prose is purposeful, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
