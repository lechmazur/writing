<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crow's sentience and loneliness are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in his oath. His "fervent apathy" adds depth, though his human-like reasoning could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the centennial alignment driving urgency. The virtual reality battle feels slightly abrupt but resolves coherently. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, blending the mundane and magical. Sensory details (weathered burlap, glowing lines) enhance immersion. The fossilized giant is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose with strong symbolism (fan/rapier, stitch-marked avatar). The ending resonates thematically, though dialogue is sparse. Subtext about loyalty and existence elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fervent apathy"). Minimal clich√©s, though the VR interface feels slightly incongruous. Emotional nuance shines in Crow's introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the fan and oath anchoring the story. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a haunting thematic aftertaste.</comment>
