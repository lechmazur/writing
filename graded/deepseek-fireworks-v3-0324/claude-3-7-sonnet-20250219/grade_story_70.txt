<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bartholomew's meticulous nature and emotional isolation are vividly portrayed, with his transformation feeling earned and resonant. His "certainly uncertain" reaction to the bulb subtly reveals his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bulb and letter serving as elegant catalysts. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the "puzzle piece" moment could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and graveyard setting is hauntingly evocative, with sensory details (lavender/ash, bulb's glow) deepening atmosphere. The witch's presence lingers without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bulb as question mark/catalyst) and subtext (perfection as armor). The ending is poignant without sentimentality, and the prose is precise yet lyrical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (tombstones like "crooked teeth"). Avoids clich√©s; the witch's payment as a transformative device feels inventive. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the theme of guarded vulnerability. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
