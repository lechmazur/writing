<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, blending scientific obsession with a transformative vision. Her "smiling saboteur" persona is distinct, though her internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Antares' peak fury driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the mannequins' sentience could be foreshadowed more subtly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The suspended city is vividly rendered, with sensory details (groaning cables, flickering light) amplifying the eerie atmosphere. The setting and mannequins are perfectly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (decay/rebirth, cosmic wrath) elevates the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though Eliza's emotional shift from anger to awe could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "angry peace" tone occasionally feels overstated. The mannequins' dialogue leans slightly into clich√© ("Progress requires destruction").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The story lingers, though the star's transformative power could be more grounded in the setting's logic.</comment>
