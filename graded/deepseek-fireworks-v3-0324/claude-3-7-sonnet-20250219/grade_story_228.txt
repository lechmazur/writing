<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her herbalist background and defiance of weaponization driving her actions. Her "voice" is distinct, though deeper internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the storm and escape serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the bunker's security flaws could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bunker's oppressive atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (green-stained fingers, recycled air) enhancing the mood. The storm's symbolic contrast is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (healing vs. destruction) and symbolism (clothespin, storm) elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though a hint of future stakes could deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("tasted freedom on her tongue") and avoided tropes. Only minor stiffness in "dramatically simple truth" slightly detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Elara's future.</comment>
