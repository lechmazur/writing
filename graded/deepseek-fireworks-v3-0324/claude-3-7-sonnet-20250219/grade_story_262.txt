<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, blending alien duty with human connection. Her "righteously flawed" tenderness adds depth, though her internal conflict could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tile's reaction to music driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the bathhouse setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (organ vibrations, steam), but the bathhouse's historical weight isn't fully leveraged to amplify the alien/human contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact via symbolism (music as universal language) and subtext (shared salvation). The ending resonates, though Sophia's intuition borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (music as cosmic key). Avoids AI tropes, but Elara's "disguised form" feels slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The tile/music connection is ingenious, though the bathhouse's role could be more integral.</comment>
