<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his backstory as a shipwrecked merchant feels underdeveloped. The butter churn as a family heirloom adds depth, but his "aloof passion" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to rebellion. The ascent via the poster is surreal yet coherent, though the ghost station's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly vivid—Earth's desolation contrasts sharply with the sterile station. Sensory details (the churn's texture, the peeling poster) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (churn as a conduit for truth) and subtext (corporate deception). The ending is purposeful, leaving room for reflection on illusion vs. reality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The butter churn's role is inventive, and the prose avoids purple flourishes. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme lingers after reading.</comment>
