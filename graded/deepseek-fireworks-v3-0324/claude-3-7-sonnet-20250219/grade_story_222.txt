<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his humble origins and cosmic ambitions well-balanced. His "voice" is distinct, though his philosophical depth could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the negotiation and dance framing a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the dance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy is vividly rendered, with sensory details (crystalline forms, bioluminescence) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the contrast between Elias and the Coalition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (locket, flower) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of compassion could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about empathy in advanced civilizations.</comment>
