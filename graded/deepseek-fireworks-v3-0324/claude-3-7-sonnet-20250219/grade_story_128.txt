<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Khepri's motivation is clear and compelling, blending duty with personal rebellion. His "hesitantly bold" nature is well-explored, though his fretfulness could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the forbidden recipe and subtitles driving the climax effectively. Pacing is strong, though the transition to Khepri's decision feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace setting is vividly rendered, with heat and grandeur enhancing tension. Sensory details (sweaty palms, shimmering walls) immerse the reader, though more auditory cues could deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bow as storytelling tool) and subtext (truth vs. dogma). The ending is resonant, though the "crystalline subtitles" metaphor risks over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original blend of ancient Egypt and surreal subtitles. Avoids clich√©s, but the "recipe" metaphor slightly overpowers the subtitles' uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
