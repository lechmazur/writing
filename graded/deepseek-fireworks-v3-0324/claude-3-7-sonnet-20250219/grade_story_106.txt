<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from sullen farmer to inspired dreamer is compelling, though his "objectively biased" perspective could be more deeply explored to strengthen his initial resistance to change.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tightly constructed, with the stamps and quilt serving as elegant catalysts for Elias's epiphany. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater station is vividly rendered, its decay mirroring Elias's stagnation. Sensory details (dripping pipes, quilt textures) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as portals, station as metaphor) and a resonant ending elevate this beyond mere vignette. Theme of breaking boundaries is layered and poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "cathedral of rust") avoid clich√©. Minor quibble: "borrowed valor" slightly over-explains the tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a story that feels expansive despite brevity. Lingers in the mind as a meditation on reinvention.</comment>
