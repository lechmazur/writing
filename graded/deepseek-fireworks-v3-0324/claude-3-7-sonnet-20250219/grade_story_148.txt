<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with decoding the tapestry driving the narrative logically toward the carousel's restoration. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and desert contrasts are vivid, with sensory details (sun-weathered skin, frayed threads) deepening atmosphere. The setting enhances the quest for hidden knowledge.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tapestry as both weather guide and meditation), layered themes (tradition/innovation), and a resonant ending elevate this beyond surface plot. Dialogue is purposeful.</comment>
