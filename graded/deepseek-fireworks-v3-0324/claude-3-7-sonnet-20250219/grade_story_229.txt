<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, though Mira's role feels slightly underdeveloped. Their dynamic adds depth, but her character could benefit from more distinct traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between rain patterns and the portal is inventive and logically sound.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ship graveyard and misty bay create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (rain, humming device) enhance immersion, and the setting deeply influences the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ring box, rain) and emotional resonance elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the dialogue could be slightly more natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "cosmic intimacy" tone occasionally verges on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story feels deliberate rather than constrained. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder and thematic depth.</comment>
