<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Everett's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions revealing depth. Dr. Mercer's hardened reaction adds tension, though her backstory could be richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is excellent, though the timeframe constraint feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is vivid but underdeveloped. The hummingbird drone enhances atmosphere, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, but the "hollow recklessness" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated. The story feels deliberate and leaves a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
