<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and consistent, with her obsession with the symbols driving her actions. Her 'pleasant meddler' trait is subtly shown through her manipulative conversations, but her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to decision. The connection between the skates, dreams, and symbols is logical, though the transition to her resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward create a striking, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (rusted skates, wet sand) enhance immersion, though the skyscraper's relevance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skates, footprints) and subtext (invitations vs. warnings). The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be richer. The theme of transcendence is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (symbols as constellations). The tone is consistent, though the "lucid confusion" could be more nuanced. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the beyond. A few tighter connections would elevate it further.</comment>
