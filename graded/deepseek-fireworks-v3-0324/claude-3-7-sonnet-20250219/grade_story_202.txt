<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his role as curator with his darker instincts. His "innocently guilty" nature adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the scavenger hunt and poison scheme driving tension logically. Pacing is excellent, though the skateboarding motif feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered, with "dusty starlight" and skateboarding sounds creating a haunting contrast. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (e.g., the rapier as a relic of violence) and layered symbolism (gravity as moral balance) make this story resonate. The ending is chillingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "code of instinct" leans slightly abstract. Avoids clich√©s, but the skateboarding motif could feel gimmicky to some.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity serves the tension, leaving a lingering unease about morality and preservation.</comment>
