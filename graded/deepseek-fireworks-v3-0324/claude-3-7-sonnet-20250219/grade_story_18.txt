<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble's stony existence and telepathic gift are vividly portrayed, with his motivation to find truth and his tragic joy deeply embedded in his character. The hair tie as a talisman adds a poignant human touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Eliza's discovery and the reversal of the curse providing a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (hissing pipes, soot) enhancing the mood. The setting perfectly complements Marble's isolation and the story's gloomy cheerfulness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, symbolism (the hair tie as a key to humanity), and subtext (freedom through recognition). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (ink as consciousness) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, though the telepathy trope is slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply affecting story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about identity and recognition.</comment>
