<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a compelling contradiction—gentle yet a fighter—and his motivation to chronicle social changes is clear, though his "gentle brawler" duality could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the flat tire device feels slightly contrived. The revelation arc is strong, though the storm's timing is convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (sandalwood, thunder) enhancing mood. The echo chamber setting is underutilized but intriguing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and literary devices (symbolism in the spice box), though the ending's clarity slightly overshadows subtext. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering reflection on preservation and contradiction.</comment>
