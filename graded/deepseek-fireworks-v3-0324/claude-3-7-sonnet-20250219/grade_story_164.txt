<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions align with his traits, and his distinct voice shines through. The "drifting arrogance" adds depth but slightly overshadows other nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is vividly rendered, and sensory details (dust motes, neon glow) enhance the atmosphere. The contrast between artificiality and nature is masterfully executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of metal flowers, dust-mote mapping) and a memorable theme of rebellion against artificiality. The ending is purposeful and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about nature’s resilience.</comment>
