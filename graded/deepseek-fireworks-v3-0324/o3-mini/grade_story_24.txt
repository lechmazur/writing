<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "ordinarily extraordinary" air could be more vividly demonstrated through actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meanders; the connection between the apologetic text and the bard's actions feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting are richly atmospheric, though the seedy bars feel slightly disjointed from the main locale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's hopeful tone slightly undercuts the promised "fractured idyll."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The dentures as rebellion are a fresh twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the timeframe element ("lull before an apologetic text") feels underutilized.</comment>
