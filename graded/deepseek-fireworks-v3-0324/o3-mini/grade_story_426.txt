<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "forgotten prodigy" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. The "angrily peaceful" attribute is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the hacking playlists method feels abrupt. The ghost train encounter is strong, though pacing wobbles slightly in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details. The ghost train setting elevates the story, though the marathon training timeframe feels marginally forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teapot, playlists) and emotional resonance, but the ending leans slightly abstract. Theme of tradition vs. technology is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "angrily peaceful rebellion"). Avoids clich√©s, though the spectral figure hug edges toward sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the marathon training feels tangential. Lingering thoughtfulness compensates for minor cohesion gaps.</comment>
