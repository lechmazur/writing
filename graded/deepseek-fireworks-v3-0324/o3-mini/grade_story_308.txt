<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edwin's bashful yet determined nature is well-developed, and his motivation to preserve art despite his role as an executioner adds depth. The keychain subtly reinforces his humble origins.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the festival preparations and dance ritual providing a clear arc. Pacing is tight but effective, though the panic moment feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and soothing tides create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Lanterns and water sounds enhance the mood, aligning beautifully with Edwin's meditative moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (keychain, tides) and subtext (redemption through art) enrich the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in blending executioner and artist roles, but "benign ferocity" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers on themes of duality and renewal, though the dance ritual could be more vividly rendered.</comment>
