<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lumberjack's motivation is clear but his "gracefully awkward" demeanor feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest for healing, but his distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the pacing feels rushed. The coded letter drives the narrative well, but some transitions between scenes are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mystery. Sensory details are strong, though the moonlight motif is overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are employed effectively, and the theme of transformation is clear. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by flowery prose and predictable tropes (e.g., cryptic letters, haunted pasts). Some metaphors feel generic, though the setting is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to balance all elements. The length feels deliberate, but the lumberjack's "harsh tenderness" tone clashes with the whimsical setting.</comment>
