<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vigilante's motivation is clear and consistent, with the wooden bead and war's toll shaping his actions. His "artfully clumsy" pursuit adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The mirror's role is intriguing but underdeveloped. Pacing is tight yet manages a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked walls, static hum) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overused. Theme of war's cost is poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original but occasionally formulaic ("unextinguished flame"). Avoids clich√©s but some phrases feel overly polished. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the mirror feels forced. Style is purposeful, and the length suits the narrative. Leaves a lingering melancholy.</comment>
