<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow's paradoxical longing and meticulous yet impatient nature are compelling, but his underwater welder background feels underutilized in shaping his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic and time-bending mechanics are intriguing, though the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The broken planetarium-turned-nightclub is vividly rendered, with reflective surfaces and cosmic nostalgia amplifying the atmosphere. Sensory details are immersive but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the ending's thematic weight slightly outweighs its emotional resonance. The central conflict (temporal reckoning) is unique but abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The vintage button box and timeline crossing feel fresh, while "moments of unraveling" leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storyâ€™s cohesion is impressive given its dense elements, though the underwater welder motif feels tacked on. The brevity serves the surreal tone well.</comment>
