<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "disinterested passion" is intriguing but could be more concretely tied to actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a dreamlike coherence but lacks a strong causal chain; the antique map and cup feel symbolic rather than driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details enhancing the witch's menagerie, though the crocheting backdrop feels slightly disjointed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong in tone and setting, but some phrases verge on purple prose, and the poet's voice occasionally feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the elements sometimes feel more decorative than integral to the narrative.</comment>
