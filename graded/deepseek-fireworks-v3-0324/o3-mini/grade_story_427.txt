<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's mechanical arm and philosophical nature are intriguing, but his motivation to "weave dreams" feels slightly abstract and could be more grounded in tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the connection between the sock and "shifting equilibria" is tenuous. Pacing is strong, though the ending resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of desolation enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are effective but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary devices elevate the prose, but some metaphors verge on overwrought. The ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal premise, but some phrases feel overly ornate ("coded desperation"). The sock as a symbol is fresh, but the philosophical musings risk pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, though the lighthouse feels underutilized. The brevity works, but the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
