<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elyon's motivation is clear but his necromantic background feels underutilized; his love for old movies adds depth but clashes slightly with his darker archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action; the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent details enhancing the eerie, nostalgic tone. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thematic resonance, though the "sound of resolve" motif feels repetitive. Ending is poignant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original blending of magic and nostalgia, but some phrases ("futuristic nostalgia") verge on contrived. Avoids major clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the necromancer premise feels underexplored. Length suits the introspective style.</comment>
