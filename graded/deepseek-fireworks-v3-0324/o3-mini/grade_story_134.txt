<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation is clear and consistent, with his obnoxious politeness and reverence for whispers adding depth. His actions align well with his quest, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Corvin's mission, but the connection between laundry cycles and magic feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and oak grove are vividly rendered, creating a rich atmosphere. Sensory details (glittering minerals, murmurs) enhance immersion, though the laundry cycles slightly disrupt the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, imagery) are used effectively, and the theme of awakening secrets is compelling. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "whispers danced in leaves"). Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion, though the tone occasionally wavers between whimsy and gravity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, and the story feels cohesive. Leaves a lingering thought about the value of listening, though the domestic-magical fusion could be smoother.</comment>
