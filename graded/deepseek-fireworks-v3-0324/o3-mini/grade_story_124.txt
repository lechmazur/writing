<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "skittish drifter" trait feels underdeveloped. The ballet shoes add depth, but his actions could better reflect his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the lunar setting feels underutilized. The pacing is deliberate but risks sluggishness in such a short piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the lunar setting feels tacked on. The brevity works, but cohesion suffers.</comment>
