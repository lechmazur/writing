<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but the "suspiciously trusting" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her cryptid researcher role, but the irony of her trust isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in places. The candle wick method is inventive but abrupt. Pacing struggles within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset. The lab and broken mirrors create vivid, eerie immersion. Sensory details (crisp leaves, fractured reflections) enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in mirrors, whimsical tone) are effective, but the ending lacks punch. Theme of "sowing seeds" is clear but not deeply resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the setting and cryptid premise, but some phrasing ("mischievous wisdom") feels repetitive. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The tray and candle wick could be more organically integrated.</comment>
