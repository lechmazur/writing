<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is intriguing but somewhat obscured by overly poetic language. The "singularly multiple" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a dreamlike coherence but lacks clear cause-and-effect progression. The ending feels abrupt yet thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with striking sensory details. The workshop setting and "graceless beauty" tone harmonize well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though some metaphors (e.g., violin string) feel forced. Theme of duality is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original but unevenâ€”some phrases verge on purple prose. The "plant whisperer" concept is fresh, but execution wavers between nuanced and contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the story's density occasionally overwhelms its brevity. Lingers intellectually more than emotionally.</comment>
