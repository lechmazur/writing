<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mr. Thornwood's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "vigilant orchardist" background feels underutilized. His sardonic glee and tragic past add depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat convoluted for its length. The connection between paper airplanes and conspiracies is inventive but strained. Pacing is uneven, with abrupt tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The fluorescent-lit facility contrasts well with the absurdity of the premise, though the peacock tail motif feels disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Literary devices are overused, bordering on purple prose. The theme of redemption is compelling, but the execution lacks subtlety. The ending is purposeful but heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but the writing leans into flowery excess. Some metaphors (e.g., peacock tails) feel forced. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but overly ambitious for its length. Elements like the orchardist role and peacock patterns feel tacked on. The style sacrifices clarity for ornamentation.</comment>
