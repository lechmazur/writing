<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elliot's motivations are clear but somewhat overshadowed by the dense prose. His actions align with his traits, though his "naive gambler" persona could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels fragmented due to excessive lyrical flourishes. The connection between beginning and end is present but obscured by stylistic indulgence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the tidal station's eerie, mechanical hum. The setting and object (candle mold) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices are overused, diluting their impact. The ending is purposeful but the emotional resonance is muted by overwriting. Subtext exists but is buried.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and predictable emotional beats. Some metaphors feel fresh, but others are strained. The tone wavers between poetic and pretentious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles under its stylistic weight. Elements serve the narrative, but the brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate. A lingering thought remains, though faint.</comment>
