<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Collin's spineless nature and luminous doubt are well-explored, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The Victorian dollhouse key effectively symbolizes his hesitations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the tight word limit makes some transitions abrupt. The mentor's role and prophecy drive the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The map projection room and "hush after the wind" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like flickering light and rustling paper immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's certainty clashes slightly with the earlier luminous doubt. The theme of self-discovery is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (enigmatic mentor, coded prophecy). The prose is lush but occasionally overworked ("grandly trivial").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the word limit strains cohesion. The story lingers with thematic depth, but some motifs feel underexplored.</comment>
