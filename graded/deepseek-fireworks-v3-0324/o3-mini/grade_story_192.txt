<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly portrayed with a unique blend of ruthlessness and kindness, though his motivation to "find connection in a digital age" feels slightly abstract for his ancient setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract connections between ancient and digital themes, which occasionally disrupts logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The villa's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending antiquity and modernity with striking sensory details, though the "poltergeist activity" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices are used ambitiously, but some metaphors (e.g., "wager of faith") feel forced. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively merges disparate elements, but the brevity highlights unresolved tensions between themes.</comment>
