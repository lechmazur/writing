<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jory's streetwise nature and resilience are well-established, but his motivation to "harvest hope from darkness" could be more deeply explored to align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the "theoretically random" events and reversed patterns occasionally disrupt logical flow, making some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with vivid sensory details and a hauntingly evocative setting, though the "lost orchard temple" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines its emotional impact. The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (cursed object, orphan hero). Some phrases feel overly ornate, hinting at AI-generated flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, though the tight word limit forces some elements to feel underdeveloped. Leaves a lingering, if slightly vague, impression.</comment>
