<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's dual identity as a dancer and reluctant seer is compelling, but her sharp-wittedness feels underutilized. Her motivation is clear but occasionally muddled by the cosmic elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in connecting the bubble bath ritual to the cosmic prophecy. Pacing is effective, but the twist feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, blending the mundane (bubble baths) with the cosmic. Sensory details are vivid and enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's thematic resolution leans slightly toward telling rather than showing. Emotional resonance is high.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the cosmic elements occasionally overshadow the personal conflict. The length feels deliberate and well-managed.</comment>
