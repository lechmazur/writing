<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brainy observer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The porcelain doll as a symbol is well-utilized, though his actions sometimes feel overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in places. The connection between ephemeral art and lost civilizations is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay and faster-than-light travel create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, though the setting's connection to the doll could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and literary devices, with a memorable theme. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering thought, though some thematic depth is underdeveloped.</comment>
