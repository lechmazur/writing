<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's frenetic energy and defiance are clear, but his motivation to "thread a labyrinth with his own story" feels abstract. His actions align with his traits, but deeper nuance is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a mystical arc but feels rushed. The power outage and radiant shifts introduce cohesion issues. Cause-and-effect logic wobbles under poetic density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tree ring reading room and ancient echoes create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rusted hinges, zephyr) elevate the mood, though some setting connections feel forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are lush but occasionally overwrought. The ending resonates, but thematic depth competes with narrative clarity. Shows more than tells, yet some emotional beats are stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept but falters in execution. Phrases like "radiant shifts" verge on repetitive. Nuance is sacrificed for lyrical density, risking purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce unevenly. The lunchbox and zephyr excel, while "formally imperfect" and "secretive defiance" feel underbaked. Lingering intrigue saves cohesion.</comment>
