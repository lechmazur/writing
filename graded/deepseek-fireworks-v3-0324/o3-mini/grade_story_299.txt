<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leon's motivation is clear but his "unsure champion" trait feels underdeveloped; his rebellious spirit and connection to the brooch are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though some transitions feel rushed. The festival resolution ties the threads well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—chalk cliffs and church bells enhance the mood, though "cheerful gloom" could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the word limit strains some nuances. Leaves a lingering cultural reflection.</comment>
