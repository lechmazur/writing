<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marian's dual nature as a faux fortune teller with genuine visions is compelling, but her "peaceful anger" feels underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed; the discovery of the bone flute and its impact could benefit from more organic buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances Marian's journey, though "throughout planting" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and evocative prose, but the theme of "taken chances" is reiterated too explicitly rather than shown through subtler means.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into overly ornate language ("peaceful anger," "treasured lesson") that detracts from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, though some elements (like "throughout planting") slightly disrupt the flow.</comment>
