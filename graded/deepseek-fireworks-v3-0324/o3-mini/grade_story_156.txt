<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Julian's confusion and diplomatic background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "liberalize" feels slightly abstract. His reactions to the key and birds reveal depth, though his "joyfully tragic" emotions could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract symbolism. The bus rides and mine setting connect, but the resolution feels rushed. Pacing is uneven due to dense prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt mine village and midnight bus rides create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (echoes, shadows) are evocative, though the "counterpoint of hearts" concept muddles the tone slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key, birds) and layered themes, but the ending's "vision" feels overworked. Subtext is rich, though some metaphors verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally formulaic in execution (e.g., "evolutionary wisdom" repetition). Nuanced emotions, though the "boldly timid" tone clashes with the prose's grandeur.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce creatively, but the story strains under its conceptual weight. The length feels deliberate, yet some themes (e.g., liberation) lack grounding.</comment>
