<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his artistic process, though his 'fiercely gentle' attribute could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness, but the transition between the garden and library feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is richly evoked with sensory details, though the celestial vines and starlit dew occasionally verge on over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a resonant ending. The theme of art mending loss is compelling, though some metaphors border on excessive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but occasional purple prose ("bittersweet nectar of renewal") detracts from authenticity. Emotional resonance is achieved more through atmosphere than nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the garden's otherworldliness slightly overshadows the painter's personal journey.</comment>
