<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin's hesitancy and open-mindedness are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, though his "raider" aspect feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the talent show's significance could be more sharply defined to strengthen cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The speakeasy setting and midnight atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the mug, storytelling) and emotional resonance, though the ending leans slightly toward exposition over subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing (e.g., "haunted by regrets"). Nuanced handling of emotion saves it from clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the "raider" and "talent show" aspects feel slightly disjointed. The brevity works in its favor.</comment>
