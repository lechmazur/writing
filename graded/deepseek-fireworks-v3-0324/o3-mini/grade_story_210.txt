<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending scholarly curiosity with a rebellious spirit. His actions align well with his desire to merge ancient lore with modern aspirations, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and some transitions between concepts (e.g., crossword to shadows) could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Elias's quest and the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor and symbolism are used effectively, and the ending is purposeful. However, the central conflict could be sharper, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but occasional overly ornate phrasing ("doubly singular quest") detracts from clarity. Nuanced emotion is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative well. It leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though the tight word limit slightly constrains its potential.</comment>
