<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcel's transformation is compelling, but his "dishonestly honest" nature feels underexplored. His motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the detour and yodeling feel contrived. Pacing is uneven, with some abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rainforest setting is vividly rendered, but the doctor’s waiting room flashback disrupts immersion. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (sheet music, flame) is effective, but the yodeling climax feels forced. Theme of redemption is clear but lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by flowery prose and predictable redemption arc. Some metaphors feel generic ("whispers of ancient lore").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some feel shoehorned. The story’s brevity works, but the whimsical tone clashes with the weighty theme.</comment>
