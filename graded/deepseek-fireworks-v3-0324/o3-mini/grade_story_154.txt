<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier's "strongly weak" resolve is compelling, but his motivation to track social changes feels slightly abstract. His interaction with the ink pot reveals depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surrealism, which risks overshadowing cause-and-effect logic. The arc is clear but feels rushed in places due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Celtic village and "jubilant despair" tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (levitating artifacts, ink pot's aura) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink pot as legacy) and layered themes (courage vs. fragility) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose ("jubilant despair" is repeated). Emotional resonance is strong, but some tropes (levitating relics) feel familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the "between games" timeframe feels underutilized. The story lingers but could refine its thematic punch.</comment>
