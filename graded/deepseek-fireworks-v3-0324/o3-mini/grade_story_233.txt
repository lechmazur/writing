<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The summoner's naivety and curiosity are well-established, but his motivation to "hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate" feels abstract and inconsistently integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a dreamlike coherence but lacks a clear cause-and-effect structure. The midnight gatherings and digital incantations are intriguing but underdeveloped as driving forces.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending ancient and digital elements seamlessly. Sensory details like flickering sconces and whispered relics enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., murals as resilience, digital whispers) are inventive, but the theme of transcendence feels overstated. The ending is poetic but lacks narrative punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in blending arcane and modern, but some phrases ("peculiarly virtual dance") verge on overwrought. Emotional resonance is hinted at but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere stylistically, but the story feels more like a vignette than a complete arc. The brevity suits its tone but limits thematic depth.</comment>
