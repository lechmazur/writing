<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diviner's shyness and quiet mystery are well-integrated, but her motivation to right a cosmic imbalance feels somewhat abstract and could be more grounded in personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is ambitious but occasionally convoluted, with parallel timelines and digital confessions straining coherence within the tight word limit. Pacing suffers from trying to cover too much.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underwater city market is vividly rendered, with shimmering relics and submerged corridors creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like rusted stalls and murky water enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., fading photographs as symbols of regret) are effective, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts like "cosmic imbalance." The ending is purposeful but rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the blend of vintage photographs and social media, though some phrases ("echo of regret") verge on clich√©. The tone of "passionate disinterest" is intriguing but inconsistently executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels ambitious but uneven, with elements like the underwater setting and parallel timelines competing for focus. The brevity highlights gaps in thematic depth.</comment>
