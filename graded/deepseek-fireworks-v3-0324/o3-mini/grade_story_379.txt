<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's dual identity as a trickster lawyer and linguistic archivist is compelling, but his motivation to catalogue disappearing languages feels somewhat disconnected from his legal skirmishes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed in places, with some logical gaps between the lawyer's actions and his linguistic mission.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered, but the "stretching hours of latent life" timeframe is underutilized, weakening the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gift tag, cryptic dares) and a memorable ending, but some prose leans toward purple, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into overly complex phrasing. The lawyer's voice is distinct, though his reasoning lacks nuance at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but unevenâ€”some elements (like the rivals' dares) feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
