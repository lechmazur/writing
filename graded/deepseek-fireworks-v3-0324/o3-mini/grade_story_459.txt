<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation is clear and profound, and her actions align well with her traits. The dried flower crown serves as a strong emblem of her journey, though her "elegantly clumsy" attribute could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The ghost tour stakeouts feel underdeveloped as a driving action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, with strong sensory details. The "dissonance of silence" is effectively atmospheric, though the sand castle lab feels slightly incongruous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary devices and subtext, with a satisfying ending. However, the theme of liberation could be more sharply articulated through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors. The writing style is purposeful, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, leaving a lingering thought. The brevity feels deliberate, though some elements (like the lab) could be more integrated.</comment>
