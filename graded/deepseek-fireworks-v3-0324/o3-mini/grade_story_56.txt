<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas's bluffing swindler persona is well-defined, but his "energetically lethargic" attribute feels slightly inconsistent with his fierce motivation. The blank price tag reveals depth, but his allies' influence could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The meet-cute feels abrupt, though the magnetize action and invisible allies add intrigue. Pacing struggles in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard/skyscraper setting is vividly surreal, blending decay and tech beautifully. Sensory details (organic light, vines) enhance atmosphere, but the timeframe's connection is weak.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (price tag as cipher) and subtext (deception vs. truth). Ending is satisfying, but dialogue is sparse. Theme of truth resonates, though some devices feel overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original fusion of tech and nature avoids clich√©s, but "gentle harshness" tone wobbles. Some prose leans ornate. Emotional nuance shines in Silas's confession.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the meet-cute and allies feel tacked on. Length suits the ambition, though the climax could linger more. Leaves a thematic aftertaste.</comment>
