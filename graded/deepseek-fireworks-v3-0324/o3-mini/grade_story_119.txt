<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calen's motivation is clear but the "sometimes always steadfast" attribute feels contradictory and undermines consistency. The key as a talisman works well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent but the tight word limit forces abrupt transitions. The cosmic insight feels rushed, lacking buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, though the carnival setting's menace is somewhat generic. Light/shadow interplay is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (key, shadows) is effective, but emotional resonance is diluted by overstatement. Ending feels purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (abandoned carnival, "arcane wisdom"). Some phrases feel AI-generated ("practiced spontaneity").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by them. Lingering thought is present but not deeply memorable.</comment>
