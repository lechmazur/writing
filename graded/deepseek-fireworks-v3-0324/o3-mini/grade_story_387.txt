<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Irina's selflessness and artistic brilliance are vividly portrayed, but her motivation to map migration patterns feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Irina's actions, though the chain reaction from her lunge feels abrupt. The ending resolves elegantly but some transitions are rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and cosmic setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (vinyl record, wind chimes) enhancing the mood. The "centuries of longing" timeframe is subtly woven in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and potent symbolism (vinyl as trust, wind chimes as defiance) elevate the story. The theme of art transcending exile is compelling, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in its cosmic-musical fusion, but occasional purple prose ("savage grace," "intangibly tangible") risks diluting authenticity. Emotional resonance is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette that leverages its constraints. The brevity feels intentional, though the density of ideas occasionally overwhelms clarity.</comment>
