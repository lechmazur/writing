<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calix's motivation is clear but his "intelligently foolish" attribute feels underdeveloped. The shapeshifter aspect is intriguing but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but the taxi ride feels disjointed from the harmonic caves. Pacing is uneven, with some rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered, but the torrential downpour clashes tonally. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (figurine, echoes) is effective, but the prose veers into purple territory. Emotional resonance is unevenâ€”moments of brilliance amid melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (oppression, cosmic balance). Some fresh metaphors, though the "measured wildness" tone feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the taxi ride disrupts momentum. The ending suggests depth, but the journey feels overcrowded.</comment>
