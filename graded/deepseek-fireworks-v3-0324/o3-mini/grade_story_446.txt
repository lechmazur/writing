<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear but his "peaceful anger" feels underdeveloped. His obsession with the ledger and kingdom restoration is compelling, though his "amiable" nature isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed. The connection between gambling, charity drives, and kingdom restoration is intriguing but thinly linked. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and twilight hues create a vivid, poetic atmosphere. Sensory details (petals, fireflies) enhance mood, though the charity drives feel oddly detached from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (hydrolyzing regrets, petals as transformation) and symbolism, but the theme of "unbecoming" is over-explained. The ending is satisfying but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on flowery prose ("peaceful anger," "whispered guidance"). Some phrases feel AI-polished rather than authentically nuanced. The gambler's voice is unique but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels strained by their density. The style is deliberate but overly ornate. Leaves a lingering mood, though the kingdom's stakes remain abstract.</comment>
