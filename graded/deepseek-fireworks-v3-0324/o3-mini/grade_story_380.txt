<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is vivid and consistent, though his "dream thief" backstory feels underexplored. His mathematical ineptitude and fragmented self are well-integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels slightly rushed. The "plunge" action drives momentum, but the soccer element disrupts cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The treehouse library and twilight atmosphere are richly evocative, though the "last human" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's redemption feels abrupt. Literary devices enhance the fragmented self theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original but occasionally verbose. Some phrases verge on purple prose, and the soccer motif feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. The brief length works, though the sport subplot weakens focus.</comment>
