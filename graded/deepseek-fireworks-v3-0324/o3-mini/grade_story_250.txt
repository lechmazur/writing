<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miranda's bluntness and heresy are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation is clear but her "enthusiastically cautious" nature feels inconsistently portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but overly reliant on abstract concepts; the stock ticker method feels forced, disrupting logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple-library setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the connection to the stock ticker is tenuous, weakening immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels strained by its own ambition; the length suits the concept, but execution falters.</comment>
