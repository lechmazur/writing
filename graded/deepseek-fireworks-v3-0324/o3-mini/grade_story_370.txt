<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "passive conspirator" role feels slightly underdeveloped. His connection to the comic is strong, but his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract imagery, which slightly obscures cause-and-effect relationships. The pacing is well-managed, though the resolution feels more thematic than narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are evocative, though the desert sands motif occasionally feels disjointed from the quantum realm.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story's subtext is rich. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict is more implied than explicit, which slightly weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext, but a few descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the brevity occasionally feels restrictive. It leaves a lingering thought, though the thematic depth slightly outweighs narrative tightness.</comment>
