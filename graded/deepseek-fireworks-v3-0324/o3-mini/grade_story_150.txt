<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jasper's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vividly drawn, but Marla's engineering brilliance feels slightly underdeveloped. Their motivations align well, though Jasper's "virtually peculiar" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively, but the "coffee shop walls" element feels tangential. Pacing is strong, though the resolution of intertwined destinies leans abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is richly immersive, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. Gears and steam harmonize with the tone, though "rehearsals" as a timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are deftly employed, and the ending lingers. However, the central conflict—beauty vs. order—lacks tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in Jasper's bone dice and Marla's contraptions, but "saturated ambivalence" feels overstated. Avoids clichés, though some prose borders on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the "coffee shop walls" disrupt cohesion. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth.</comment>
