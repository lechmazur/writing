<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The feral ranger's enigmatic nature and motivation to embrace the unknown are compelling, but his actions sometimes feel overly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a dreamlike flow but lacks clear cause-and-effect progression; the ending feels more atmospheric than resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dandelion field and twilight setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details that amplify the melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, though some metaphors verge on overindulgence. The ending lingers but doesn't fully crystallize its themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable AI-esque phrasing ("whispered of forgotten lore"). The brass scale and receipts feel fresh, but the ranger's "wild" trait is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story's cohesion is impressive given its constraints, though some elements (like the receipts) feel underutilized. Leaves a haunting, if slightly vague, impression.</comment>
