<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "cheerful despair" is intriguing but not deeply explored. His actions align with his defiance of hopelessness, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the spin-the-bottle confessions feel contrived. Pacing is effective, though the climax leans heavily on exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and ghostly atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are strong, but the "unremembered future" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the theme of defiance resonates. The ending is purposeful but slightly overwritten. Subtext is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some AI-like phrasing ("cheerful despair" repeats excessively). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown in places. Some metaphors feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but the spin-the-bottle method detracts from its gravity. The length suits the narrative, though some elements feel forced.</comment>
