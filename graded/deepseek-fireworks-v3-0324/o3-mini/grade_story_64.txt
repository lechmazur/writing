<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Estrean's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his reverence for the scale and quest for wisdom are compelling, but his "uncertainty" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders between introspection and action, lacking a tight arc. The connection between the verdict's hush and the alchemist's journey is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere blends whimsy with gravitas. Sensory details (scents, clinks of energy) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scale as ledger, mundane miracles) and lyrical prose stand out, but the ending lacks punch. Theme of sacrifice is poignant but over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original setting and fresh metaphors ("edges technically wild") avoid clich√©s, though some phrasing leans ornate. Emotional nuance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the story feels like a vignette rather than a complete narrative. The length suits its meditative tone.</comment>
