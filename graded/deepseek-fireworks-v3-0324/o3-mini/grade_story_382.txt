<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ranger's "gleeful sorrow" and quiet resolve are intriguing but lack deeper exploration. His motivation is poetic but somewhat abstract, leaving his actions feeling more symbolic than grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot meanders like the library itself, with a dreamlike coherence. The arc is subtle but present, though the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest assetâ€”evocative sensory details (old paper, coffee) and the labyrinthine setting create a haunting, immersive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary craft elevate the prose, though the emotional impact is muted by the abstract style. The ending is purposeful but leans heavily on metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive, if elusive, whole. The brevity suits the vignette-like quality, but the thematic depth demands more space to fully resonate.</comment>
