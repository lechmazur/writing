<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's immortality and duty are compelling, but his "bitter laughter" feels overused and lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a mystical arc but feels disjointed; the connection between sketching, particle gardens, and ecosystem restoration is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is vividly surreal, blending science and magic with striking sensory details, though the "earbud cover" slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors, though some phrases ("rigidly flexible") verge on contrived. Avoids clichés but risks over-complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambitious and cohesive despite dense elements, but the word limit strains thematic depth. Leaves a haunting, if uneven, impression.</comment>
