<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with clear motivation, though the "cheerless duelist" archetype feels slightly generic. The interplay of regret and innovation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but somewhat rushed in the resolution. The connection between culinary experiments and redemption could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the abandoned spaceport's eerie mood. The setting and object (chest) are meaningfully linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending leans slightly toward exposition. Emotional resonance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional clich√©s ("haunted by regret"). The fusion of sci-fi and culinary redemption is fresh, but execution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the word limit strains the thematic depth. Leaves a lingering, if slightly uneven, impression.</comment>
