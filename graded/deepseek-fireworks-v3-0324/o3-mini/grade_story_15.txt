<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elinor's motivation is clear and consistent, with her defiance of the gods and nurturing of hope driving her actions. Her "solemnly absurd" attribute adds depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the postcards and forge visits serving as effective anchors. The ending feels purposeful, though the connection between meals and rebellion could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and thick fog create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (clanging forge, frost and flame) enhance the mood, though the postcards' role in the setting could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in postcards, forge as heartbeat) are effective. The theme of defiance is clear, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. The ending lingers but lacks a definitive punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal postcard exchanges and defiance of gods. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("solemnly absurd mission"), but the core concept avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the forge and postcards serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though the "between meals" framing slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
