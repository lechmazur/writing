<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and poetic, but the "escaped lab experiment" aspect feels underexplored, leaving some dissonance between origin and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over tangible progression; the tight word limit leaves key transitions implied rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with minimal clichés. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("latent symphony"), but the core voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the fedora and lab experiment backstory strain believability. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
