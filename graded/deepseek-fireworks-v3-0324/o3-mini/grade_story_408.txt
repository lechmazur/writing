<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's conscientious objector background and valiant boredom are well-integrated, but his "coy malevolence" feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his pacifist actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the craft fairs and mapping feel tangential to his core motivation until the rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm-battered orchard and craft fairs create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the orchard's connection to Marcus's mission is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rusty nail) and evocative prose, but the ending's communal celebration feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (haunted veteran, symbolic heirloom). Some phrasing is overly ornate without payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story strains to unite them cohesively. The brevity highlights gaps in logic.</comment>
