<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cedric's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his "diabolically benevolent" attribute feels underdeveloped, though his actions align with his spy role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the time-reversal method, which feels convoluted for the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brewery setting is vividly atmospheric, but the "empty porch" timeframe feels tacked on. Sensory details (herbs, bubbling cauldrons) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (button, fences) is effective, but the theme of renewal is overstated. Ending is satisfying but overly neat for the story's complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable spy tropes and flowery prose. Some metaphors (e.g., "tapestry woven with sacrifice") feel forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but strain under word limits. The story feels like a compressed novel rather than a tight vignette.</comment>
