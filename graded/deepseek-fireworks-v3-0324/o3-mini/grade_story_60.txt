<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("whispered through the corridors of time") edge toward clich√©. The blacksmith's detachment is refreshingly nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves its elements, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy and purpose. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
