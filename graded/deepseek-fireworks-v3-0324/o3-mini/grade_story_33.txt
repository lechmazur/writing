<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The birdwatcher's motivation is intriguing but slightly obscured by overly poetic language. His actions align with his nonviolent ethos, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic holds together, but the cosmic blink and kilter action feel abrupt. Pacing is uneven, though the arc achieves a semblance of resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—evocative sensory details (porcelain mask, marble reflections) immerse the reader in a haunting, bureaucratic limbo.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the prose, but some metaphors verge on overwrought. The ending resonates, though the theme of nonviolence occasionally feels overstated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the story's density sometimes overwhelms its brevity. Lingers in the mind despite minor contrivances.</comment>
