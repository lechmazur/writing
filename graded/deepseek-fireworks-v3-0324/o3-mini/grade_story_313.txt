<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jasper's character is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his "unusually normal" behavior occasionally feels at odds with his con artist background.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the spectral interrogations could be more integrated into the dystopian farm's logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is evocative but underutilized; the atmosphere supports Jasper's arc but lacks deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional depth, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is satisfyingly resolute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, though the dystopian farm and spectral interrogations could be more tightly woven.</comment>
