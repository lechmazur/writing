<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's jaded bartender persona is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to understand the past is clear, but his transition from bartender to historical sleuth feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but overly reliant on abstract connections (doodles, crystals) that strain believability. Pacing is uneven, with some sections feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystal lab setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "optimistic desperation" is immersive, though the fireworks timeframe feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scalpel, crystals) and lyrical prose, but the theme of "challenging fate" is overstated without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into AI-typical florid phrasing ("mosaic of time," "symphony of life"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements feel forced together (bartender + lab + scalpel), but the storyâ€™s ambition and stylistic flair partially compensate.</comment>
