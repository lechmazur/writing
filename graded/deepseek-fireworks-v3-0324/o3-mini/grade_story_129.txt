<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The troubadour's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his melancholic yet hopeful nature, though his unpredictability could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc, but the "torpedo" action feels slightly abrupt, and the pacing wavers between lyrical reflection and sudden intensity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, though the rocket launch site's connection to generational curses could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional depth elevate the storytelling, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is hauntingly satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("ghosts of oppression"). The ring and tablecloths are fresh, but the euphoria tone feels inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive and ambitious vignette, though the fusion of elements sometimes strains logic. The brevity serves its poetic density well.</comment>
