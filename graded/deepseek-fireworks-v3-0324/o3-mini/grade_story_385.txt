<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The meddler's motivation is clear but his "pleasant" and "openly manipulative" traits feel somewhat contradictory without deeper exploration. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the meddler's method, but the connection between the skates and the symbols feels forced. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with the hospital ward and obsidian skyscraper creating a haunting contrast. Sensory details enhance the mood, though the beach wanderer's footprints feel slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are strong, but the ending's "reluctant revolutionary" shift feels abrupt. The theme of memory and defiance is compelling but could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some generic phrasing ("lucid confusion," "scattered seeds"). The story avoids clich√©s but lacks a fully distinct voice or surprising twists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lingering impact is thoughtful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
