<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the climax feels slightly rushed given the weight of the "impossible choices."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, though the storyâ€™s brevity slightly undermines thematic depth.</comment>
