<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow's "meticulously impulsive" nature is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his motivation to master empathy feels underdeveloped despite the poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot's surrealism creates cohesion, but the painter's confession feels tangential, and the pacing wavers between lyrical and disjointed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending scientific and poetic tones with exceptional sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, musical memories) elevates the prose, though some metaphors verge on overwrought. The ending resonates but lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into AI-like florid phrasing ("enthusiastic apathy" feels forced). Nuance in emotion is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively for the word limit, though the smuggler premise feels superfluous. Lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
