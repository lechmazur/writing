<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's apprehension and exceptional skill are clear, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract. The candle and cycles of compassion hint at depth, but his internal conflict isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the hot air balloon festival feels disjointed. The cyberpunk setting and truth-seeking motive drive the story, though pacing wobbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid cyberpunk atmosphere with strong sensory details (neon hum, data streams). The candle's contrast with the high-tech world is striking, but "ancient timeline" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candle, data relics) and evocative prose, but some metaphors verge on purple. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of compassion could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original cyberpunk-archer fusion, but the balloon festival clashes tonally. Some phrases feel overly ornate ("borrowed dawn"). Emotional resonance is unevenâ€”stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the festival and "ancient timeline" strain logic. The candle and truth-seeking motive stand out; the rest feels decorative rather than essential.</comment>
