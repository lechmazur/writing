<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The farmer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "typically atypical" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his yearning for independence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the discovery of the cards feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the word limit strains resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the ethereal plains and post-war atmosphere enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the ending is purposeful. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, but occasional flowery phrasing ("whispered promises of transformation") verges on purple prose. Nuanced emotion is present but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but some concepts (e.g., "song of boundaries") could be tighter.</comment>
