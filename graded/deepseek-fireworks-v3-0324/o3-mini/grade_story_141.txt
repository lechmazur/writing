<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlon's superstitious nature and motivation to transcend the physical realm are clear, but his "always strange" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The scavenger hunt feels abrupt, while the cave exploration is more compelling. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing suffers in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underwater cave system is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The "space between thunder and lightning" timeframe is poetic but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (notebook, scars) and mood, but the theme of "women's wisdom" feels tacked on. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (mystical caves, poetic omens). Some prose is overly ornate ("shadows in oil"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some feel forced (scavenger hunt). The length suits the mood, but the storyâ€™s depth is uneven. Leaves a lingering question but not profound.</comment>
