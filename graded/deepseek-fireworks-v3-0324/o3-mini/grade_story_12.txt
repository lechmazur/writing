<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian's aloofness and cartographer role are well-integrated, but his motivation to "learn the language of the soul" feels abstract and could be more grounded in tangible actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot meanders slightly, with the kayaking memory feeling disconnected from the mall setting. The resolution is poetic but lacks a clear cause-and-effect arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic mall is vividly rendered, blending technology and nostalgia effectively. Sensory details like the cracked tile and holographic maps enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (maps, tiles) and lyrical prose, but the emotional impact is muted by the protagonist's detachment. The ending is reflective but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose ("eager resignation"). The kayaking memory feels contrived, and some metaphors are overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements, though the mall setting and memory theme donâ€™t fully synergize. The brevity works, but the story leans more on atmosphere than narrative drive.</comment>
