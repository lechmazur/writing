<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with a melancholic depth, though his woodsman background feels slightly underutilized. His motivation is clear but occasionally overshadowed by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders with lyrical beauty but lacks tight cause-and-effect logic. The ending resolves thematically but feels abrupt for the buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and neon skies create a haunting, original atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., humming frequencies, rusted platforms) are masterfully immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hairbrush as talisman, railways as veins) elevates the prose. Emotional impact is strong, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal setting, but phrases like "despairing cheer" and "artfully messy" recur excessively. Some emotional beats feel stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole, but the word limit strains coherence. The ending lingers, though a few assigned concepts (e.g., water tower echoes) feel tacked on.</comment>
