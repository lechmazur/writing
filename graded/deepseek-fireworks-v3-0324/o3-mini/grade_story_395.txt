<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the transition from gardening to music festival feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though some cause-and-effect relationships could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating island cloud spa and arcane gardens are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the story's ethereal tone, though the music festival slightly disrupts the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (jasmine, clay) are effective, and the theme of rebellion against tradition is compelling. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>
