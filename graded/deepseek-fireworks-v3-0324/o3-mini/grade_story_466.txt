<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's cunning and morally ambiguous nature is well-established, but his motivation to "corner an elusive destiny" feels somewhat abstract and could be more concretely tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the transition between grocery shopping and the smoke signal tower feels abrupt. The xerograph method is intriguing but underdeveloped in driving the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite its eclectic elements, but the grocery shopping frame feels underutilized. The brevity works, but some ideas could be more fully explored.</comment>
