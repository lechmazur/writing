<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlon's motivation is clear but his "quietly rebellious" nature feels somewhat abstract; his actions align with his ambition, but deeper nuance in his voice or reactions would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc from cynicism to hope, though some transitions between neon messages and the DVD feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fairy light repair shop is vividly rendered, with sensory details (neon glows, whispers) enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. The setting and object (DVD) connect meaningfully to the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lights, DVD) and subtext (resistance vs. cynicism), though some metaphors verge on overused. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into flowery prose ("twilit affirmations"). The rebellion theme avoids clich√©, but some phrases feel algorithmic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the neon signs and DVD serving the theme well. The brevity feels deliberate, though a sharper emotional punch would solidify its impact.</comment>
