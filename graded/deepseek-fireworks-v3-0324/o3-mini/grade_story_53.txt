<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's rashness and protective nature are well-conveyed, but his motivation for seeking cosmic solace feels slightly abstract. His connection to the postcards adds depth, though his impulsiveness could be more consistently shown in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit, with the journey and fortress visit providing structure. However, the "chance encounter" feels underdeveloped as a catalyst, and pacing slows in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fortress and caverns are vividly rendered, with sensory details (whispers, echoes) enhancing atmosphere. The mystical tone complements the setting, though the "moving day" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (postcards, stones) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, but some metaphors verge on overworked. Theme of cosmic wonder is compelling but occasionally heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on mystical tropes. Some phrases ("whispering winds," "eternal spark") feel formulaic. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the "moving day" and "chance encounter" feel tacked on. The brevity suits the introspective tone, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
