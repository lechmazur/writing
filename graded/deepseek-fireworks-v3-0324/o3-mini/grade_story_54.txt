<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "even-tempered" nature feels underdeveloped compared to his rebellious and methodical traits. The scarf's symbolism is strong, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the star-tracking method feels contrived. The ending resolves elegantly, though the middle sags under atmospheric excess.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vividly rendered, but the "regretful letter" timeframe feels tangential. Sensory details excel, though the scarf's connection to decay is overemphasized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices are lush but occasionally overwrought. The theme of legacy is compelling, though the "vibrations of intent" concept muddles subtext. Emotional resonance is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the carnival setting, but "elegant chaos" and "vibrations of intent" verge on pretension. Some phrases feel AI-polished rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends elements, but the star-tracking method and "regretful letter" feel forced. The length suits its meditative tone, though momentum falters.</comment>
