<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maribel's motivation is clear and consistent, blending culinary art with rebellion. Her "cynically gentle" nature subtly shapes her actions, though deeper exploration of her backstory could enhance her complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Maribel's quest, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The connection between baking and revolution is inventive but occasionally feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (flickering neon, enchanted dust). The garage setting and mystical tone amplify the story's uniqueness, though the time machine element feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used masterfully, and the ending is purposeful. The theme of resistance through art is compelling, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the blending of baking and contagion, but occasional flowery prose ("whispered beneath lingering starlight") risks tipping into purple. The narrative avoids clich√©s but could refine its voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the garage's role could be more integral to the climax.</comment>
