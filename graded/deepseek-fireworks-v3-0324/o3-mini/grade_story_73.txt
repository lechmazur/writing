<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Camilo's motivation is clear but his "diligently whimsical" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with preservation, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has coherence but feels abstract. The arc is present but rushed; "kindrelize" drives the narrative unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”vivid sensory details and a haunting blend of ancient/modern elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices and subtext, but the ending's "eternal light" feels abrupt. Theme of duality is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused phrases ("whispering winds"). Some metaphors feel fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce but strain under word limits. The story lingers, though some choices feel forced.</comment>
