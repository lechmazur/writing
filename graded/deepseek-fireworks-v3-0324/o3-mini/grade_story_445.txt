<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sleepy nomad's transformation is compelling, but his initial motivation feels slightly abstract. His humility arc is well-executed, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders before finding focus; the disguise room feels abrupt. The ending ties themes together, but pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with strong sensory details. The disguise room's "spiritually material" aura is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (barbells, masks) is potent, but some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending resonates, though subtext could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into florid prose. The nomad's voice avoids clich√©, but the trader's riddles feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the disguise room's introduction strains logic. The length suits the reflective tone.</comment>
