<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Oliver's socially awkward inventor persona is well-defined, but his "hopefully cynical" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but occasionally muddled by overly poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat fragmented by dense metaphors. The connection between the diner and the encrypted archive feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The diner and workshop atmospheres are vividly rendered, though the archive's integration is weaker. Sensory details (clock ticks, clinking dishes) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as time-reaper) and layered themes elevate the prose, but some metaphors overreach. The ending resonates, though the climax feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the whistle's concept, but "reversed trails" and "tree of regret" verge on clich√©. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, though phrasing occasionally strains.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the diner setting feels secondary. The story lingers intellectually, though some thematic weight is sacrificed to style.</comment>
