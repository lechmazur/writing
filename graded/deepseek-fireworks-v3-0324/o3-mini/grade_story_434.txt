<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' could be more distinct. The stained napkin as a relic adds depth, but his theatrical flair feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the map and the artifact feels abrupt. The zero-gravity flame ritual is intriguing but underutilized in driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The booth as a spectral sanctuary is brilliantly realized, though the zero-gravity element feels slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and subtext, but the ending lacks full resolution. The theme of ancestral wisdom is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The playful dread tone is unique but inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. However, the zero-gravity flame and spectral map could be better integrated.</comment>
