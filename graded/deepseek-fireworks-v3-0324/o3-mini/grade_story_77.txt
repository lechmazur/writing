<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's introverted empathy is well-integrated, but his motivation to champion outcasts could be more explicitly shown through action rather than internal reflection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meandering; the marionette reassembly feels symbolic but lacks clear narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, blending cosmic and terrestrial elements evocatively, though the space pirate hideout feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's "grander odyssey" tease feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The starfish and marionette motifs are fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity slightly undermines its thematic weight. Still, it lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
