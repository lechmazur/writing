<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lord Alastair's listlessness and noble lineage are hinted at but lack deeper exploration. His motivation to "discover the power of intention" feels abstract and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but meandering. The rendezvous concept drives the story, though the resolution is vague. Pacing is uneven, with some sections feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted corn maze is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details. The setting enhances the eerie tone but occasionally overshadows character development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the scarf's symbolism) are effective, but the theme of "shared laughter" clashes with the somber tone. The ending lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused phrases ("whispered secrets," "ironic awe"). The prose leans purple, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to balance its many elements. The length feels restrictive, leaving some ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
