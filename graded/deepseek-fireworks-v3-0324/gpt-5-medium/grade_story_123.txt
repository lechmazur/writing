<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and poetically grand. The inherited boots and aunt’s notes deepen their voice and history, though the "eager brewer" aspect could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows organically with a tight arc. The sweep action feels slightly contrived, but the brew’s creation and communal sharing provide resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and hauntingly nostalgic. Sensory details (comet-tail water, gummy solder scent) elevate the setting to near-mythic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and subtext. The brew as a "possible dawn" and the aunt’s "procedure" as legacy are resonant. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentically lyrical. Avoids clichés, though "gleefully morose" toes the line of overwrought. The voice feels uniquely human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. The elements serve the story’s theme of revival, and the brevity feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
