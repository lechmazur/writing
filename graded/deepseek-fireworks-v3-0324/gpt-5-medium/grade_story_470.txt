<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from longing to acceptance. The hidden diary and its instructions drive the narrative forward logically, and the pacing feels deliberate yet unhurried.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine library is vividly rendered, with sensory details (valves chuffing, catalog balloons) enhancing the atmosphere. The contrast between the carnival above and the quiet depth below deepens the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the screw as mercy, the diary as wisdom) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, leaving a lingering question about the cost of guardianship. Themes of imperfection and compassion are deftly layered.</comment>
