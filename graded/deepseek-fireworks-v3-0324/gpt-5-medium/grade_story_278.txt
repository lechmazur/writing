<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's brooding nature and sculptor role are vividly integrated, revealing layers of servitude and subtle rebellion. Their motivation to escape is clear, but the transition from janitor to sculptor could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the dust's choreography driving the escape. Pacing is excellent, though the decoy sculpture's impact on donors could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crater base is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (detergent froth, dust braiding) elevating the setting. The glasses' constellations subtly deepen the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors (dust as choreography, light as harness) resonate. The ending lingers, and subtext about servitude vs. freedom is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice, avoiding clich√©s. The dust's "theoretically spontaneous" dance is a standout. Minimal tell, maximal show.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the theme of coded rebellion. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
