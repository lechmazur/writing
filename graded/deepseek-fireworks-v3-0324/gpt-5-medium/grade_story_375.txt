<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is vividly primal yet methodical, with a distinct voice that blends scientific precision and poetic defiance. The "smiling saboteur" duality is compelling but could delve deeper into their internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses organically from quiet study to cosmic confrontation, with pacing that balances urgency and lyricism. The arc feels complete, though the mannequins' role borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—the tower city hums with eerie vitality, and sensory details (static, wooden jaws clicking) amplify the gorge's haunting atmosphere. A masterclass in immersive setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors ("teacup brimming with aurora") electrify the prose, and the theme of flawed transcendence resonates. Ending is poignant, though the star's wrath could feel more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines—mannequins as translators of dead frequencies? Brilliant. Some phrases ("angry peace") verge on over-poetic, but the overall voice is fiercely unique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting gem. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves the reader pondering restraint versus power—more than the sum of its parts.</comment>
