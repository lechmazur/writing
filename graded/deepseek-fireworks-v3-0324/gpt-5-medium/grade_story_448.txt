<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin's distrust and guarded nature are well-developed, but his motivation to build a legacy feels slightly under-explored in favor of atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with a clear arc from stoppage to resolution, though the word limit slightly rushes the masters' skepticism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The guild hall's soot-drenched atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (ash, brass, humming shell) grounding the world perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell as city, candlestick as witness) and subtext about labor and memory elevate the storytelling, though the ending's unanimity feels overly neat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and free of clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (soot as palimpsests) and nuanced emotion. Only minor artifice in Orrin's distrust/kinder duality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered vignette that transcends its constraints. The sewing machine's callback is a standout moment of thematic unity.</comment>
