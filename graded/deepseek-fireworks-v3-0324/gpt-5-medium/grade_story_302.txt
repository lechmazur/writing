<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bard's brazen humility and fierce nonchalance are deeply integrated into their actions and narration, creating a distinct, memorable voice. Motivation—kissing the horizon of madness—is poetic but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from performance to confrontation, resolving with thematic cohesion. Pacing is tight but not rushed; the heckler's arc is a standout.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk airship is vividly rendered with mechanical jellyfish chandeliers and wheezing valves. Atmosphere perfectly supports the bard's chaotic artistry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("notes like bent nails"), layered subtext (taming chaos as surrender), and a hauntingly purposeful ending elevate this to near-flawless craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. The bard’s voice and worldbuilding feel uniquely lived-in, not algorithmic. Emotional resonance is earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, daring story where every element serves the whole. Leaves the reader with the aftertaste of storms and a craving for more.</comment>
