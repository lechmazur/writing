<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear, complex, and deeply integrated into their actions and backstory. Their voice is distinct, and their growth through failure is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from tension to resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the washcloth's role as both prop and symbol drives the narrative organically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming weather engines, breathing walls) that deepen the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's themes of control and harmony.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (washcloth, pendant) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying yet open, and the theme of stewardship resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The conjurer's flawed humanity and the nuanced handling of "taming" nature feel fresh. Language is precise without being overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, and the emotional impact lingers. A standout example of micro-fiction with depth.</comment>
