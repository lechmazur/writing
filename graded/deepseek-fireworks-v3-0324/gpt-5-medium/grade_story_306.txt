<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation and voice are vividly distinct, blending vulnerability and irreverence. Their actions align with their complex past, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a surreal but coherent arc, though the climax feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but the word limit strains resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is electricâ€”neon and glass create a haunting, sensory-rich mood. The chamber and chapel panel fuse unnervingly well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (halo shaped like rent) and subtext. Ending lingers, though the theme's repetition slightly dulls impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh, audaciously original voice. Tropes (child star, ambition) are subverted with visceral specificity. No AI clunkiness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a startling whole. Length feels intentional, but the "wild magic" thread could be tighter.</comment>
