<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cybernetic veterinarian's motivation is clear and distinct, with their unconventional approach to healing revealing depth. Their "voice" is strong and aligns with their role, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the bucket's discovery and use driving the narrative forward logically. The arc feels complete, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—vivid sensory details ("kaleidoscopic coral," "raucous silence") immerse the reader. The setting enhances the story's themes and character actions flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (metaphors like "stained glass rehearsing a confession") elevate the prose. The ending is purposeful, and the central conflict (taboo vs. care) resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The reef's personification and the bucket's role are fresh, and the emotional nuance ("touching pain without fixing it") feels human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story masterfully. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact ("care outgrew the need to conquer").</comment>
