<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intriguing, blending undercover research with cryptid mythology. Their 'suspiciously trusting' attribute adds depth, though more internal conflict could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly coiled and purposeful, with each action driving toward the encounter. Pacing is masterful for the word count, though the mirror maze resolution could be slightly more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—broken mirrors hum with latent energy, and the lab's decay feels alive. Sensory details (charred wick, mirrored scales) are razor-sharp and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: "monsters prefer etiquette to force" lingers. Theme of subterfuge as care is resonant. Ending is poetic, though the creature’s cooperation could use more tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh and unhurried, avoiding tropes. The tray-as-badge and candle logic feel original. Only minor hint of over-polished prose in the finale.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of assigned elements. The brevity serves the fable-like tone. Leaves a haunting aftertaste of complicit transformation.</comment>
