<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's cosmic powers and academic wildness are vividly integrated into his motivation and actions, creating a distinct and compelling voice. His transformation feels earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the cosmic twist briefly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargoyle-terrace setting and eerie atmosphere are masterfully evoked. Sensory details (rusted door, cold brooch) deepen immersion. The abyss symbolizes internal tension perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (brooch as ledger) and layered subtext. The ending is resonant and thematically rich. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "Scholar-Spanner" bridge is a fresh metaphor. Emotions are shown, not told. Only minor stiffness in "sky-thrum."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking gem. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about inherited potential.</comment>
