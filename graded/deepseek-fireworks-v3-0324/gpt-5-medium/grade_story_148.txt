<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's storm-chaser background and monastic tasks create a compelling duality. Motivation to restore the carousel is clear, but "eagerly unwilling" could be more integrated into actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from desert to monastery, with decoding the tapestry as a clever hinge. Pacing is tight but nuanced, though "between tasks" slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Alpine monastery and desert contrasts are vividly rendered. Tapestry, tongs, and storm sensory details immerse deeply. Only minor gaps in tactile description of the carousel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (knots as coordinates, sand marching) and thematic depth. Ending satisfies but "nostalgic innovation" feels slightly over-signposted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original voice avoids cliché. "Inner strength" as hush and "exacerbate the wood’s grief" show fresh linguistic precision. Only rare minor phrasing ("front rolled over the peaks") verges on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. Carousel restoration as spiritual journey lingers. Brief length amplifies focus, though monastic tasks could be more textured.</comment>
