<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fortune teller and narrator are vividly drawn, their motivations and interactions layered. The fortune teller's "modestly flashy" shawl and "fierce repose" add depth, though her rogue status could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly, with the "unspoken offer" and wine-tasting method driving a coherent arc. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive, though the ending's abstraction slightly softens resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—longhouse, inkwell, and "hush of an overlooked era" merge into a haunting, sensory-rich world. Firelight, seal fat, and turf roof details elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful craft: "slow comet trapped in domestic orbit" and textured dialogue ("gravel, velvet") show rather than tell. Theme of memory vs. erosion resonates, though the ledger's symbolism leans slightly opaque.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("quiet rigging in my chest") and nuanced emotion avoid cliché. Only minor AI tics (e.g., "zigzag" overuse). Voice feels distinct, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize brilliantly; the longhouse and inkwell feel indispensable. The brevity heightens impact, leaving a lingering meditation on preservation.</comment>
