<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The serene fisher's grief and motivation are poignantly clear, with his actions revealing depth. His silence and subtle gestures (e.g., wristband, willow bone needle) speak volumes, though his serenity borders on passive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly woven plot with a resonant arc. The quilt unraveling as a method to uncover wisdom is inventive, and the ending—tying the wristband—feels earned. Pacing is deliberate but not sluggish.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere: the greenhouse's spectral ferns, dew-rewriting leaves, and misted almost-leaves create a haunting, immersive world. Sensory details (glass trembling, threads yielding glyphs) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Layered storytelling with rich subtext (grief as coastline, illusions as mercy). Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are deftly employed. The ending lingers, blending sorrow and renewal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("calm is a raft," "nets hold moonlight"). No clichés. Emotions are shown through action (palm beneath leaves) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and profound. Elements serve the story’s emotional core. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout piece with lingering resonance.</comment>
