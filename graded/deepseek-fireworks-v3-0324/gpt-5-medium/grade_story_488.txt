<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is vividly clear, and their distinct voice shines through the first-person narration. Their actions align perfectly with their desire to outshine their reflection, though a tad more internal conflict could deepen their complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the leaf-map and demolition wires creating a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, though the climax could linger slightly longer for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—sensory details like "rusted lightning" and "brackwater panes" immerse the reader. The quantum beach and condemned arcade merge seamlessly into the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext, the story evokes both thought and emotion. The ending is purposeful, though the "blink-and-miss" resolution of the reflection could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. Phrases like "corroded rapture" and the leaf-map mechanic are fresh and deeply integrated. No AI-generic tells detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with lingering unease and wonder.</comment>
