<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters are distinct and motivations are clear, but the sleepy nomad's backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Mira's edges and resolve are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a strong arc, though the transition from hiking trail to secret agents feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, blending fantasy and practicality effectively. Sensory details (e.g., "river stones grinding under snowmelt") stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices and layered subtext elevate the story. Ending is purposeful, though some symbolism risks over-subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors avoid clich√©s, but a few phrases ("faithful to a route") verge on formulaic. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are integrated cohesively, and the story feels deliberate. Lingering resonance is achieved, though some thematic weight could be sharper.</comment>
