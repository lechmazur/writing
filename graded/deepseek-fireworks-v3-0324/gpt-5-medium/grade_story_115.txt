<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's curiosity and tinkering nature are vividly portrayed, and their motivation to make amends is clear and compelling. Quen's scars and shared history add depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from remorse to forgiveness. The "hopeful excavations" metaphor drives the narrative logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city is rendered with striking sensory detail and thematic resonance. The plague doctor's mask and capillary alleys enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's literary craft is exceptional, with potent metaphors ("interconnected wishes," "sediment of negligence") and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Subtext about accountability lingers.</comment>
