<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a coherent arc from confinement to tentative liberation. The rain's rhythm and snuffbox's revelation drive the narrative elegantly, avoiding rushed or disjointed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and rain-soaked atmosphere are masterfully evoked, blending realism and myth. Sensory details (sand, rain, gears) immerse the reader while reinforcing the mayor's psychological landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (snuffbox as legacy, dunes as collective memory). The ending is resonant, merging personal and civic resolution. Literary devices are deployed with precision and originality.</comment>
