<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sentient toaster's voice is distinct and compelling, with clear motivation and a poetic lens. Its reactions to the child and elder reveal depth, though its arc could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the retreat motif feels slightly abrupt. The connection between traditions and the AI's archival mission is subtle yet logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Sumerian palace reimagined with tech is vividly atmospheric. Sensory details (toast, river reed, bitumen) enrich the world, though the "shouting silence" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors (light as quotient, recipes as stanzas) and subtext (memory vs. technology) elevate the story. The ending resonates with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh language and minimal clich√©s. The toaster's perspective avoids AI tropes, though some descriptors edge toward over-precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on lineage and language.</comment>
