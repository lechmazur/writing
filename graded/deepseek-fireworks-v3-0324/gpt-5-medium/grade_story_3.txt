<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's surly yet introspective nature is vividly rendered, with his "serenely frantic" demeanor and knot-reading craft revealing depth. Motivation is clear but slightly abstract—rooted in cosmic curiosity rather than tangible urgency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The riddle-as-plot-device is masterful, threading introspection and action seamlessly. Pacing is deliberate but not sluggish, and the resolution—tying understanding to a "ferry running eternally"—feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The graveyard setting is hauntingly evocative, with sensory details (gulls, lanterns, salt-bleached memorials) amplifying the maritime melancholy. Atmosphere and character psyche intertwine flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft: metaphors like "the tide's cursive" and "sky's ledger" elevate the prose. The ending resonates philosophically, though the market wisdom thread slightly overcomplicates the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice and imagery, avoiding cliché. Only minor flaw: "market wisdom" feels slightly grafted onto the sea-mysticism core. Otherwise, authenticity shines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers like a tidepool's reflection—subtle but profound.</comment>
