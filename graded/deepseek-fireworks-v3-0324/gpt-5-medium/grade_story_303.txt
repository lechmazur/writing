<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dreamer pilot's idiosyncratic traits (mirrors on sleeves, peculiar joy) are vividly rendered, but motivation to "map cognitive patterns" feels abstract without deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively from language exchange to portal encounter, though the spice rack's sudden emotion-naming jars slightly. Pacing balances lyricism with progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisite—interdimensional hum, ticking spice jars, and silk-like hush create transcendent sensory immersion. Portal and stall settings harmonize.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("streets bent like conjugations") and subtext (grief as cartography) elevate this. Ending resonates, though radio-tuned "regret" feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Startling originality in voice and concept (spices as emotional constellations). No clichés; metaphors ("parliament of murmurs") are freshly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock beautifully. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of longing and linguistic liminality.</comment>
