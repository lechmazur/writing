<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly from the arcade’s neon noise to the seeds’ awakening, with a satisfying arc despite brevity. Pacing balances introspection and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a feral, hopeful echo.</comment>
