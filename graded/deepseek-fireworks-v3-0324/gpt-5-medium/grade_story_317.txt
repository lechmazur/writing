<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Kerren-5's nostalgic android caretaker role is deeply woven into the narrative, with clear motivations and a distinct voice. Their "anxiously fearless" attribute is consistently reflected in actions and reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear cause-and-effect chain driving toward resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the saboteur subplot adds depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and poetic, with vivid sensory details (frost, helium fizz, brass telescope warmth) enhancing the levitation facility's atmosphere. The cave's crystalline orchard is particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors like "dustproof case of my brass telescope" and symbolism of the telescope's repurposing) are masterfully deployed. The ending resonates with quiet poignancy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes with fresh turns of phrase ("courteous amnesia," "brazen modesty"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, through actions like serving undrinkable tea.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion; every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of melancholy and resolve.</comment>
