<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tinkerer's whimsical yet oddly truthful nature is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and actions aligned with his character. His 'voice' is distinct and memorable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc despite the word limit. The connection between environmental change and mortality is logically developed, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace and cavern sea create a stunning, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming stalactites, mineral tears) enrich the world and underscore the story's themes beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., the thermometer as a metaphor for mortality). The ending is poignant, and the theme of finite existence is explored with layered subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering meditation on impermanence and illusion.</comment>
