<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bard's motivation is clear and beautifully integrated with his "traditionally creative" attribute. His folio of pressed leaves and jokes for ghosts/engineers add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly abstract; the bard’s wind-pattern method feels organic, though the "age of renewal" concept could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere: solar wind collection point and twilight orchard merge tech and folklore. Sensory details (ozone, skeleton maracas) are vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich literary craftsmanship—ash-char lines, ghostly laughter in data logs. Theme of renewal through folklore and tech is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original: no clichés, fresh metaphors (comedy as lubricant). Avoids AI tropes; voice is distinct, blending whimsy and precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but some elements (e.g., "cosmic orchestra") flirt with overabstraction. Still lingers artfully.</comment>
