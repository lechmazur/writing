<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear and deeply intertwined with their role as a locksmith. Their distinct voice and metaphysical nature add layers, though their physicality could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the storm of secrets, with a satisfying arc. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the transition to the archipelago feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined, with sensory details (salt, hushed gulls) enhancing the atmosphere. The floating orchard and driftwood setting is strikingly original and deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors like "locks instead of fruit") are masterful. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of cultural preservation resonates. Subtext is layered, though some symbolism risks opacity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is vivid without being florid. The story feels uniquely human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, offering depth beyond its surface. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
