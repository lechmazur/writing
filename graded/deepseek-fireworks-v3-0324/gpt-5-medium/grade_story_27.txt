<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Character's voice and motivation are distinct, with the cynicism and truth-telling curse driving the narrative. The teacher's evolution is subtly revealed through his confessions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured around the moon phases, with a clear arc from stagnation to transformation. Pacing is deliberate yet never rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The short length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic weight. A standout piece.</comment>
