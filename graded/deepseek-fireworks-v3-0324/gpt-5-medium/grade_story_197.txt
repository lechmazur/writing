<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and poetic, blending con artistry with tenderness. Their voice is distinct, and actions align beautifully with their arc from fraud to confession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's cosmic-to-mundane progression is cohesive and surprising. Pacing is deft, though the sticky-note method feels slightly underdeveloped as a plot driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is sublime—Yggdrasil as both setting and metaphor, with sensory details (sap tick-tocking, wind’s salesmanship) that deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (fear vs. wonder, fraud vs. grace). Literary craftsmanship shines, though the climax’s resolution leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startlingly original. No clichés; metaphors (e.g., “dishonest wind”) feel fresh. Nuanced emotional resonance, avoiding AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements meld organically. The brevity serves the story’s ethereal quality, leaving a haunting, dreamlike aftertaste.</comment>
