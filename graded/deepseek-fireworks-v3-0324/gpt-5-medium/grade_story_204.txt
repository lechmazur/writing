<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from prejudice to empathy is subtly powerful, though the "professional cuddler" role feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's circular structure—from prejudice to reconciliation—is elegantly executed, though the spaceport setting’s relevance is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured (iron, citrus, wind), but the abandoned spaceport clashes tonally with the intimate, earthbound themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the phantom punch as a metaphor for absence and the unspoken rules of grief is hauntingly original. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh imagery ("bottled starlight," "absence has a grammar") and nuanced emotion elevate this beyond cliché. Only minor stiffness in transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite disparate elements; the widow’s bargain and the punch’s symbolism suggest deliberate, layered storytelling.</comment>
