<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's insomnia and painterly obsession are vividly rendered, though the depth of their struggle with the "final obstacle" could be more concrete.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot's dreamlike logic coheres surprisingly well, but some transitions (e.g., classroom to mushrooms) feel abrupt despite the surreal intent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion; the mushroom workshop and spore-humming air are masterfully evocative, though the classroom setting slightly less so.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich with layered symbolism (hat, puddles, chalk dust) and a haunting, open-ended resolution. Minor overreliance on metaphor in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("sugared thunder"), with only a faint whiff of algorithmic density in the opening paragraph.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock elegantly, though the "final obstacle" theme could resonate more sharply. Leaves a lingering, poetic unease.</comment>
