<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's "loudly introverted" attribute is vividly portrayed, and their motivation to reunite with courage is clear and compelling. The damaged CD and fireflies serve as powerful emblems of their inner struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from entry to resolution. The use of meandering and fireflies as guiding methods enhances cohesion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and post-human setting are richly atmospheric, blending decay and hope. Sensory details (humming glass, flickering fireflies) immerse the reader masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (CD, fireflies, mirror). The ending is purposeful, and the prose is lyrical without being overwrought. Emotion resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. Metaphors ("a moth in a lantern," "crooked hope") feel fresh. No clichés or formulaic phrasing—distinctive voice throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative gem. Elements serve the story seamlessly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact of resilience.</comment>
