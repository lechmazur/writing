<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchardist's melancholy and transition from fruit to echoes is vividly rendered, though his "genuinely artificial" hope feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc—from drought-ruined orchards to stolen lullabies—is taut and resonant, though the black-market transaction subplot lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion: the skull's grit, spider-silk dampers, and the chamber's lightning-sung air create a hauntingly cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with layered metaphors (grafting knife as memory, prophecy as trellis) and a lingering, elegiac impact. Only the technician's role feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Startlingly original voice and perspective, with no clichés. The skull-as-song-repository conceit is fresh, and the prose avoids excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements, though the technician's artificiality slightly disrupts the emotional core. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
