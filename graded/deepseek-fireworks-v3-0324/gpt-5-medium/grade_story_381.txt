<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are vividly clear and distinct, with the necromancer's quiet purpose and the narrator's mapping obsession enriching their dynamic. The baseball cap as a relic adds depth to the necromancer's character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows organically despite tight word count, with a clear arc from exploration to resolution. Pacing is tight but purposeful, though some transitions between concepts could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and hauntingly original, with crystalline cave and futuristic nostalgia creating a striking, cohesive mood. Sensory details (e.g., "star fungus shimmered like streetlights") elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storytelling is rich with subtext and literary craft—echoes as cartography, memories as tolls—but the ending, while poignant, leans slightly abstract. Dialogue (internal/external) is natural and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors ("time polished the quartz with home movies"). Avoids clichés and AI-generic phrasing, with nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements meld seamlessly into a cohesive, thematically dense narrative. Brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of mapping the unseen.</comment>
