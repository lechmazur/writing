<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is subtly but effectively conveyed, and his interaction with the ladle reveals depth. His "openly private" nature is consistent but could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the ladle's mythos driving the minstrel’s arc. The ending feels earned, though the rush hour contrast slightly distracts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion, with sensory details (meteor textures, iron rain) enriching the giant’s domain. Rush hour’s thunder feels slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (ladle as shrine) and subtext (silence as covenant). The prose is lyrical yet purposeful, elevating the theme of renewal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original metaphors ("ridge constellations") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés, though "gentle turmoil" risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the ladle as the narrative linchpin. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of transformation.</comment>
