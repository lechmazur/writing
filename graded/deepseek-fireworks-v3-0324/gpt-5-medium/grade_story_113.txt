<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hesitant bard's transformation is subtly yet effectively portrayed, with the dinosaur plush serving as a poignant anchor for their courage. Motivation is clear but could benefit from slightly deeper interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is remarkably cohesive for the word limit, with a clear arc from hesitation to resolution. The dream-hopping conceit drives momentum without feeling gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—xenon-lit tunnel and communal dream tapestry blend surrealism with emotional weight. Sensory details (lint storms, whispering clocks) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical yet precise prose wields metaphor (time as a quilt) brilliantly. The ending's thematic resonance—"bow[ing] to fragility without pretending it was strong"—lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in avoiding tropes; the dinosaur plush as "Mesozoic parliament" and grief's "architecture" vs. "weather" are strikingly fresh. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the story feels distilled rather than constrained. Leaves reader contemplating collective healing through art.</comment>
