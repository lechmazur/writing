<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swordsman's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with the theme of wisdom. His actions and reactions reveal a nuanced, disciplined character, though a touch more distinct voice could elevate him further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and completeness within constraints. Pacing is deft, though the schematic's resolution might benefit from slightly more grounding in cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the petrified forest and its silent celebrations are richly evocative, merging setting with theme seamlessly. Sensory details (mineral rings, ash-colored light) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Profound literary craftsmanshipâ€”imagery, symbolism, and subtext resonate deeply. The ending is purposeful, though the thematic "choreography of attention" could be slightly more sharply defined.</comment>
