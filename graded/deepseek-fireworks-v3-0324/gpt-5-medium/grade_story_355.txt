<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dancer’s aloofness and harsh compassion are vividly rendered, with letters and compass serving as potent extensions of their inner conflict. Motivation is clear but slightly abstract.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows organically through the dancer’s actions, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions between scenes abrupt. Resolution is poetic but slightly opaque.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The installation’s surreal atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (neon puddles, sea-glass hues) deepening the mood of aftermath. Setting and character harmonize perfectly.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite literary craftsmanship—metaphors (compass as "shivering vow"), symbolism (letters as "secret ribs"), and subtext (silence as "practical wardrobe") resonate deeply. Ending lingers with haunting grace.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery (e.g., "mirrored octopus to a field of luminous bones"). No clichés; emotion is shown through motion and layered细节. Only minor stiffness in a few phrases.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette where every element serves the theme of confession. Brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reader interpretation without feeling truncated.</comment>
