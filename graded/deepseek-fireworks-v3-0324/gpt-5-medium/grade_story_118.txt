<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's voice is distinct and their motivation subtly revealed through interactions, though the "uniformly peculiar" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with the candle wax method and charger as clever devices driving the mole’s exposure. Pacing excels within constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, leaving a lingering meditation on secrecy and collective listening. Feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
