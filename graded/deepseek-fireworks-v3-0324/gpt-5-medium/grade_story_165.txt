<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear and compelling, blending justice with mystical purpose. His actions align well with his gentle yet determined nature, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The reassembly of the butterfly drives the narrative logically, though pacing slightly rushes the dwarves' transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite world-building: the underground city is vivid, and sensory details (hammered dawn, bell-petal dreams) elevate atmosphere. Tone and setting harmonize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, reversed messages) and layered themes (justice as growth) resonate. Ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but a few phrases ("joyful terror") risk clich√©. Emotion is shown beautifully, but dwarven dialogue could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. The story lingers, though brevity slightly limits thematic exploration. A standout with minor polish needed.</comment>
