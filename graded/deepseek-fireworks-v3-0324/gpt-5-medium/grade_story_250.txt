<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's blunt heresy and cautious enthusiasm are vividly portrayed, with consistent motivation and distinct voice. The teddy bear effectively symbolizes unresolved promises.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the stock ticker's role feels slightly abrupt. Pacing and coherence are strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the library and temple merging seamlessly. Sensory details (dust, ticker chatter) enhance the mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the conflict (old promises vs. revived mentor) is compellingly resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal clichés. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors avoid AI-generated pitfalls. Prose is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. Leaves a lingering resonance—doubt as earned resolution.</comment>
