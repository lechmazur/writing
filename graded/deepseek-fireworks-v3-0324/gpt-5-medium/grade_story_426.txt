<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation is vivid and consistent, with a distinct voice that blends secrecy, stubbornness, and defiance. Their actions align perfectly with their role as a preserver of fading knowledge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc that balances introspection and action. Pacing is excellent, and the ghost train serves as a resonant anchor for the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with evocative sensory details (mildew, static, cedar) that deepen the setting’s connection to the protagonist’s mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices, the story lingers in the mind. The ending is purposeful, and the conflict—between preservation and oblivion—is compellingly unresolved.</comment>
