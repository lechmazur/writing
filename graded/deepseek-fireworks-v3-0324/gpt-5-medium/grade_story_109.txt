<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's cold-natured yet compassionate duality is compelling and consistent, though the "artistic awakening" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs deftly from mission to revelation, with tight cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with stylistic precision and lingering emotional weight.</comment>
