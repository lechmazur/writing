<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closed-off reaver's transformation is subtly compelling, though his initial motivation could be clearer. His distinct voice and the interplay with the narrator's mocking affection are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is tightly woven, with the child's drawing and nagging poems driving momentum. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope park is vividly immersive, with grotesque flowers and shifting light enhancing the story's dreamlike tension. Sensory details (greasy paper, starlight on tongues) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (palimpsest maps, milk teeth prophecies) and layered subtext elevate this. The ending’s emotional resonance is slightly undercut by abrupt generational-pattern snapping.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Startlingly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "chew the moonlight"). No clichés; the reaver's internal conflict feels nuanced and human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, dazzling fusion of elements. The brief length serves the fable-like tone, and the lingering question of whether tenderness can rewrite legacy is potent.</comment>
