<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The carefree dancer is vividly portrayed with a distinct, whimsical voice. Her motivation to collect sacred practices is clear and consistent, but her reactions could delve deeper into emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the dancer's actions, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing wobbles near the end.</comment>
