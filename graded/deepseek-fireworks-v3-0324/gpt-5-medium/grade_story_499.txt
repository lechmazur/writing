<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghostwriter's motivation and voice are distinct, with clear alignment between their poetic rationality and their actions. The sandals as a relic of a past life deepen their characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from subterfuge to rebellion. The coded stanzas and corrosion metaphor drive the narrative forward logically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bio-luminescent orchard and orchestra tuning create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (spores, sandals' scent) enrich the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered metaphors (rust/blades, seeds/ciphers), subversion of political rhetoric, and a resonant ending. The conflict between service and destiny is masterfully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés with fresh imagery (e.g., "rosin haze like weather inside a lung"). Nuanced handling of doubt as a weapon, not just a trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with every element serving the theme. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving a lingering question about authorship and power.</comment>
