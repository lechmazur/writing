<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, distinct, and deeply integrated into the narrative. The "wildly reserved" attribute is subtly but effectively portrayed, and the professional apologizer role reveals profound layers about the world and the character's place in it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from arrival to resolution. Nuancing grief and mapping seasonal changes drive the narrative coherently, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with evocative sensory details (e.g., "glass that grows like dew," "petals pulsing like tiny lungs"). The nanobotanical garden and post-law setting are vividly rendered and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The story lingers in the mind, with a hauntingly satisfying ending. Dialogue, though sparse, is purposeful and natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. Emotional nuance is shown, not told. The voice is distinct and avoids AI-generated pitfalls like abrupt jumps or formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with every element serving the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering, thought-provoking impact.</comment>
