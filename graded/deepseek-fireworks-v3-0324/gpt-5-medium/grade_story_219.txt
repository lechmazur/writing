<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and poetic, but the "fading champion" backstory feels underexplored, leaving some emotional weight unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and deliberately fragmented, mirroring the theme of mapping consciousness, though the climax (unfolding the swan) risks feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—sensory details and atmosphere are immersive and thematically resonant, elevating the story’s mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism, evocative prose, and a haunting ending. Minor quibble: the "fathomless gaze" metaphor teeters on overuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors, though a few phrases ("comforting disturbance") edge toward contrivance. No overt AI tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with only the champion’s backstory feeling slightly underbaked for the story’s ambition.</comment>
