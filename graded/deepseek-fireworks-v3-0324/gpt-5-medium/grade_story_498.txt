<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arvo's nervous yet calculated demeanor is compelling, and his motivation—defying indifference with tenderness—is nuanced and clear. His actions align with his role as a kingpin turned gardener, though his "nervous" trait could be more consistently woven into his physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with a clear arc from tension to resolution. The detour to the arch feels organic, and pacing is expertly managed. Only minor tightening of cause-and-effect logic (e.g., guards' reactions) could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Outstanding atmosphere—midwinter’s harshness mirrors the enclave’s xenophobia, and sensory details (seed pods clacking like teeth, wet coal) deepen immersion. The arch’s symbolism as a border/water relic is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors ("moth wings brushing iron fences"), layered subtext (defiance via gardening), and a resonant ending. The theme of unsettling indifference with beauty is powerfully shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original—seed pods as contraband, a kingpin gardening—with fresh metaphors and avoided clichés. Minor quibble: "fragile ferocity" slightly overstates the tone. Otherwise, distinct and inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, elegant story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering image of "small brown mouths of tomorrow" confirms its depth.</comment>
