<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's "weary monk" persona and "timidly loud" attribute are vividly realized, and their motivation to learn forgotten languages is both clear and compelling. Their actions and reactions deepen the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from arrival to resolution. The fairy tale pairing method is inventive, though it slightly strains coherence. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) elevates the prose. The ending is satisfying, and the theme—language bridging science and myth—resonates deeply.</comment>
