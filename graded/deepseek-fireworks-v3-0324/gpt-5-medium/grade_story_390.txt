<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assassin's calm demeanor and unique motivation (turning prophecy into possibility) are compelling, though his personal longing for retirement feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and surprising, with a clear arc (preparation, execution, implication) despite the brevity. The butterfly-wing method is whimsical yet functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (ink, osmanthus, lacquered corridors) and a hauntingly lyrical atmosphere elevate the palace setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful prose, layered symbolism (leaves as maps, comedy as incense), and a wry, subversive tone create lasting impact. The ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original voice and conceit. Tropes (assassin, prophecy) are subverted with humor and specificity. Only minor over-reliance on "whispers."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of brevity and depth. Every element serves the story's wit and poignancy; the length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
