<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's free-spirited herbalist nature and academically artistic attribute are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. The use of the vintage sewing kit as a reliquary adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the act of memorization and restoration, though the tight word count slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, but pacing feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with evocative sensory details (brine, fish-scale scissors) enriching the coral restoration setting. The abandoned wall motif ties seamlessly to atmosphere and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "stitches where mortar once failed") and emotional resonance. The exploration of shame and forgiveness through coral restoration is layered and poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("graph their shy replies"), though minor AI-like flourishes ("tidal time" feels slightly overworked). Nuanced handling of generational shame avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on healing.</comment>
