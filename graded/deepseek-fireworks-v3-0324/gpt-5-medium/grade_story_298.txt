<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chameleon stage actor's motivation is deeply integrated with their traits, creating a compelling and distinct voice. Their rationally impulsive nature drives the plot convincingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and a satisfying arc. The cold-case mystery resolution feels organic, though the word limit slightly rushes the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly evocative, with sensory details (sunlight through debris, resin-stiff hem) enhancing atmosphere. The palace setting is seamlessly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "celestial crime scene"). The ending resonates, blending emotional honesty with theatrical illusion. The theme of refuge is layered and poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors ("hunting roles the way drought birds hunt last puddles") are fresh, and the tone is consistent yet nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with creative interplay. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on truth and performance.</comment>
