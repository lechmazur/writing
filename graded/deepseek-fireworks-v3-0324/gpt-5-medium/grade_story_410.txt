<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Astute hermit's motivation is clear and unique—restoring water systems with limited means—but deeper introspection could sharpen their "voice."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly paced; the bread-scent method is inventive, though the elevator motif feels slightly disjointed from the cavern setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flora and cavern cathedral are vividly immersive. Sensory details (bread scent, metallic psalm) elevate the atmosphere masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (e.g., "laughter finds every crack") and layered subtext about isolation and unnoticed labor. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original—blunt scissor and bread-as-signal defy tropes. Despairing humor and metaphors ("mind honed so thin it bends light") feel authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; brief length amplifies the story’s precision. Lingers like "rain practicing to be rivers."</comment>
