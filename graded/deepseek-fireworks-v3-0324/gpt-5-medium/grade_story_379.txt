<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and layered, blending their past as a lawyer with their current mission. The "trickster" quality shines through in their actions, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the character's goals, but the tight word limit forces some transitions to feel abrupt. The ending resolves well, though the middle could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (hydrogen-lit orchards, drone irrigation) enhancing the atmosphere. The "ghostly resolve" tone permeates effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors like "loopholes polished into a mirror") are masterful. The storyâ€™s theme of linguistic preservation resonates deeply, though the dialogue with rivals could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and subverted tropes (e.g., legal decoys as biodegradable subpoenas). Rare moments of over-formality ("impatiently patient") slightly disrupt flow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story coheres brilliantly around its elements, leaving a haunting impression. The brevity feels intentional, but a few more beats of interaction could deepen emotional impact.</comment>
