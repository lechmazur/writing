<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vivid and consistent, blending mechanical and mystical traits seamlessly. The "repulsively attractive" attribute adds depth, though its impact could be explored more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically, with a clear arc from confession-gathering to road-mending. Pacing is tight yet evocative, though the "infinity" timeframe slightly blurs causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—subterranean orchard and star river merge mechanics and magic. Sensory details (oil slick smile, taillight fruit) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wrenches as branches, choir of confessions) and lyrical prose create profound emotional resonance. Ending is both triumphant and haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startling originality in blending mundane/ethereal. Metaphors ("wreck shining rainbows in oil") feel fresh. No clichés, only startling juxtapositions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly—opera glasses and puzzle pieces serve theme organically. Lingers like a dream half-remembered at a stoplight.</comment>
