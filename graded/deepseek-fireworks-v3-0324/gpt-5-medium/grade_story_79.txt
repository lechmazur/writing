<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sheriff's motivation is clear and poetic, with his rebellion against the town's dirge revealing depth. His actions align with his quiet, determined nature, though his 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the sheriff's action driving a resonant arc. Pacing is deliberate, and the ending feels earned, though the word limit slightly truncates emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the library's fusion of science and poetry enriches the action. Sensory details (e.g., "whispering like muted starlight") deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent symbolism and subtext. The ending lingers, though the conflict could be more overt. Literary craft elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh ("time feels suspended like dust in a sunbeam"), and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting aftertaste, suggesting depth beyond the page.</comment>
