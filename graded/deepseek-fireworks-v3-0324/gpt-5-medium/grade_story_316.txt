<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seraphic seamstress is vividly drawn, her timid yet deliberate nature aligning perfectly with her childhood promise. Her actions reveal depth and consistency, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence and a satisfying arc within the word limit, with the scoreboard and mending action driving momentum. Pacing is strong, though the arcade's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the temple, factory whistle, and scattered harmony fuse into a haunting, immersive world. Sensory details (bobbins, river gnashing) elevate the mood masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary craft (stitching words as sutures, ink as shared memory) and layered subtext. The ending resonates, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—fresh metaphors (sandbags of syllables), nuanced emotion, and no clichés. The prose is purposeful, avoiding purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about collective healing as craft.</comment>
