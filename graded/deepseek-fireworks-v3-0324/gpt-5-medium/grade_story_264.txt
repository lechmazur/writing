<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly, with the experiment fitting organically into the "between innings" pause. Cause and effect are logical, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and cohesive, with striking sensory details (projector hum, static hair) enhancing the alchemical wonder. The station's hush contrasts beautifully with the baseball game outside.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship. The story layers metaphor (flaws revealing nearness), symbolism (cracked lens), and subtext (cynicism vs. wonder). The ending lingers, balancing whimsy and profundity.</comment>
