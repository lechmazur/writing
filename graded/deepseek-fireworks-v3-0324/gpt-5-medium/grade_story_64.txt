<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's uncertainty and moral conflict are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation (mapping trails for their sister) driving their actions. Their "technically wild" attribute subtly influences their rejection of the broker's deal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the scale's dilemma, with a logical arc from temptation to refusal. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the forest’s moving trails could use slightly more setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating marketplace and tribunal pavilion are richly evoked, with sensory details (copper, sap, fennel) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting deeply informs the conflict and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and potent symbolism (the floor as a map, the scale as moral test) elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though the "mundane miracles" idea could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in blending alchemy, cartography, and myth. The story avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("heart clinking like loose vials") and nuanced emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting narrative where every element serves the theme of preservation vs. transience. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about sacrifice.</comment>
