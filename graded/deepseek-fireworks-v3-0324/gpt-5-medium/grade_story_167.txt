<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending duty with rebellion. Their "uncommonly typical" nature and scholarly role create a compelling tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from resolve to action. The pacing is deliberate, and the climax (the whispered tale) feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting is vividly rendered, merging futuristic and mythic tones. Sensory details (the hum of vents, dust of centuries) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered metaphors (the coil as antenna, the well as conduit), emotional resonance, and a haunting, purposeful ending. Theme of forbidden memory shines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and perspective. Avoids clichés; the wire coil and time-travel bureaucracy feel fresh. Nuanced emotion (e.g., "contraband sunlight").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful vignette. Every element serves the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering weight—the "well in the air" is unforgettable.</comment>
