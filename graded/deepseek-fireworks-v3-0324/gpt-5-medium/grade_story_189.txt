<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The apprentice's "uniquely literal" mind is a clever contrast to the mystical setting, but their motivation could be more explicitly tied to personal stakes beyond the master's influence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is stellar, with the rotary tumbler and star maps elegantly converging. Pacing is tight, though the war's relevance feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for mystery without sacrificing cohesion.</comment>
