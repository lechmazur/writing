<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's dual role as an elevator repair technician and ghost interlocutor is compelling and well-integrated. Their "elegantly clumsy" nature and motivation to "find liberation in letting go" are subtly but effectively revealed through actions and interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from tension (ghosts, crumbling sandcastles) to resolution (the prince's fading, the protagonist's acceptance). Pacing is masterful for the word count, and cause-effect logic is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab and ghostly elevator limbo are vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming air, crumbling flowers) that deepen the melancholic atmosphere. Setting and theme are symbiotically linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft: silence dissonance as a metaphor, the flower crown’s symbolism, and the delicate balance of "complex simplicity." The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice—no tropes or clichés. The fusion of mundane (maintenance logs) and metaphysical (ghosts, liberation) feels fresh. Emotion is shown through precise, unconventional details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, luminous story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for ambiguity and reflection. The "scraped shin of mercy" epitomizes its depth.</comment>
