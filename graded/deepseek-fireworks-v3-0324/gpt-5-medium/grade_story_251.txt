<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's ambivalence is vividly portrayed, but their motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" feels slightly abstract, needing more grounding in personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's structure is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from vision to resolution, though the "final oath" concept could be more concretely tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony's atmosphere is richly rendered, with sensory details (dust, ozone) enhancing the prophetic tone. The setting feels integral, not just backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling craft—layered metaphors (marbles as moons), subtext (ambivalence as a hinge), and a resonant ending. Only minor nitpicks on clarity of the oath's stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery ("bashful arrogance," "scars make a face unique"). Avoids clichés, though the "cosmic scoreboard" metaphor edges toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements woven organically. The brevity feels deliberate, though the "oath" could anchor the theme more sharply.</comment>
