<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The jungle curator's voice is distinct, and their motivation (guilt over the frogs) is clear and drives the narrative. Their connection to the violin adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive, with a clear arc from guilt to resolution. The road trip feels organic, though the word limit constraints slightly compress pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the temple and museum settings are vividly rendered, and sensory details (ice violin, frog calls) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., guilt as a drum). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of redemption through wonder resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés. The ice violin and logically illogical temple feel fresh, and the prose avoids AI-generic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder and quiet resolution.</comment>
