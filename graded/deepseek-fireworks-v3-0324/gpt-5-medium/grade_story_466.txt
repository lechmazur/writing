<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's cunning connoisseur trait is vividly portrayed through sensory details and actions, but motivation shifts slightly abruptly from dinner conversation to decoding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "sudden urge" feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is sublime—smoke towers, seed packets, and grocery settings merge seamlessly. Sensory details (singed thyme, burned rosemary) immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully. The story feels deliberate, not constrained, and lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
