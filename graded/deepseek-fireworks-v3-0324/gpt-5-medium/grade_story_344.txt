<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is compelling and nuanced, aligning well with their claustrophobia and explorer background. The subtle shift in their panic to curiosity is masterfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the tasting method driving discoveries. The arc from observation to intervention feels organic, though the word limit slightly rushes the mother-son resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house is evocatively rendered, with sensory details (steam, plum scent, tilted stones) deepening atmosphere. The setting is inseparable from the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (jam as emotional key), layered subtext, and a resonant ending. The prose is lyrical but never overwrought, with metaphors ("knot tasting rain") striking fresh.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept. The claustrophobia diver/jam-tasting pairing is unexpected but cohesive. Minor quibble: "healing touch" edges toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s emotional and thematic unity. The length feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of connection and distance.</comment>
