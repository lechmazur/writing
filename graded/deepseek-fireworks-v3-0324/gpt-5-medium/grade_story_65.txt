<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape death is clear and compelling, but the 'slapdash bard' trait feels underdeveloped beyond surface imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs elegantly from mundane to mystical, with tight cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is sublime—tectonic edge and hourglass reset create a visceral, mythic tone. Sensory details (soda like cathedral bells) dazzle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, startlingly inventive fusion of elements. Leaves reader with lingering unease and wonder.</comment>
