<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with their actions consistently aligned. The gambler's voice is distinct, blending pragmatism and poetic reverence for agriculture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The telekinetic dice and tapestry drive the narrative organically, though the pirates' abrupt shift to planters feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, blending sci-fi and agrarian mysticism. Sensory details (ozone, loam, humming beans) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered metaphors (dragons as terraces, dice as rain), resonant themes of preservation, and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Subtext thrives in every line.</comment>
