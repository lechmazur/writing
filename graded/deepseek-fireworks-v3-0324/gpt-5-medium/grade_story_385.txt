<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength—obsidian skyscraper, frost-laced windows, and ticking skates fuse into a haunting, immersive mood. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered metaphors elevate the prose. The ending lingers, though the central conflict (fear vs. healing) could be more explicitly threaded earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves surreal elements into a meditative arc. Its brevity serves the dreamlike logic, though some thematic weight relies on reader inference.</comment>
