<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation (finding a cure for sister) is clear and drives the narrative, but the 'overburdened clerk' trait feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The stamp-triggered world-weaving is inventive but slightly abrupt in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Undersea greenhouse and dissonant calm are masterfully evoked; sensory details (glass humming, algae formulas) are immersive and original.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (metaphors like "cathedral of glass"), layered subtext (postage as time/vaccine), and a hauntingly purposeful ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors (stamps as "little kingdoms"), and nuanced emotion. Avoids AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story; brevity feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic weight (grief, relativity, hope).</comment>
