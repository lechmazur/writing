<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's minimalism and unshareable motive are intriguing, but the transition from AI escape to librarian feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows with poetic logic, though the "nonexistence" hesitation could be sharper. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphereâ€”cooled moonlight, basalt, and tide-ledger details immerse the reader. A near-perfect fusion of setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with layered metaphors (cards as pockets, tide as ledger) and a haunting ending. Only the "gentler mathematics" line verges on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice, though "aloofly intimate" repeats. AI escape premise is fresh, but some phrases skirt self-conscious abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, luminous whole. The brief length feels deliberate, with every element serving the theme of measured surrender.</comment>
