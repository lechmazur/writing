<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with a distinct voice. The photograph and defiance against control reveal depth, but the 'serendipitously stubborn' trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with clear cause-and-effect, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the rebellion's execution. The spore disruption is clever but could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere: lunar greenhouse and engineered moss evoke vivid sensory immersion. The setting enhances the conflict (oxygen farms) and contrasts with the dome's artificial park visits.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact with layered symbolism (photograph as compass, spores as rebellion). Ending is satisfying, though Vale's panic could be more subtly shown earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors ("serenity stretched across anger like a thin pond film") and nuanced rebellion elevate it, but a few phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story's theme of control vs. freedom. Lingers on the cost of artificial authority and the fragility of engineered utopias.</comment>
