<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's "normally weird" attribute and inventor background are vividly portrayed, motivation is clear and consistent, but deeper emotional layers could enhance complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc and logical cause-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the infiltration's resolution could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cyberpunk alley and "standstill" timeframe are masterfully integrated, with immersive sensory details and atmosphere that amplify the story's mood and action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices, evocative themes, and a haunting ending. Subtext about reclaiming identity from corporate exploitation elevates the narrative, though dialogue (with the drone) could feel sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The "ruthless kindness" tone and inventive worldbuilding defy predictability, though minor phrasing quirks ("neon drip") hover near ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about agency in a mechanized world.</comment>
