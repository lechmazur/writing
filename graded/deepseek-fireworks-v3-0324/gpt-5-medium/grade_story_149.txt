<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and distinct, with a unique voice. The "unlikely prophet" role is well-realized, but some nuances of rebellion could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows with poetic logic, though the laundromat origin feels slightly abrupt. The arc is cohesive and resolved with satisfying thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive; the giantâ€™s study and "haunting delight" are vividly rendered, though "glimmering transitions" occasionally overshadow grounding details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism, resonant theme, and evocative prose. The ending lingers, though the laundromat metaphor could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors, but minor AI-like flourishes ("glimmering transitions" repetition) slightly undercut authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. Only the laundromat backstory feels less organic than the rest.</comment>
