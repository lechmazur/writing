<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's weatherbeaten state and internal conflict are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His 'voice' is distinct, though deeper introspection could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, leveraging the word limit effectively. Cause-and-effect logic is strong, though the resolution’s pacing borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion; the lighthouse prison and mirrored reflection are evoked with haunting sensory detail. The setting actively shapes the conflict and themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (mirrors, patterns) and lyrical prose. The ending resonates with thematic depth, though the central conflict’s resolution could be slightly more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "throat of bells"). Avoids clichés and formulaic phrasing. Nuanced handling of emotion and subtext elevates it beyond typical literary fare.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering meditation on choice and regret. A near-flawless balance of style and substance.</comment>
