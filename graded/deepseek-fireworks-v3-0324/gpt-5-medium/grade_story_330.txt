<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's dejection is vividly rendered, and his motivation to atone is clear, though slightly abstract. His actions align with his remorse, but his personality could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from regret to redemption. The pacing is deliberate yet fluid, and the cause-and-effect logic holds. Minor ambiguity in the vow's specifics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—zero-gravity and clock-struck hours merge into surreal, immersive beauty. Sensory details (chandeliers ringing like bells) elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (origami tide, barnacled whispers) and layered themes of atonement. The ending is poignant, though the vow's delivery could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Metaphors are fresh ("raft of light"), and the tone is consistent, though "deepening horizons" risks overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and lyrical. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
