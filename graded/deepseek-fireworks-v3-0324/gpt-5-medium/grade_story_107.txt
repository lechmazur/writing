<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's background as a game show host is seamlessly integrated into his stranded existence, revealing depth through his practiced patter and yearning for applause. His motivation to rescue sacred knowledge is compelling but slightly underdeveloped in the urgency of execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is ambitious and inventive, though the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions (e.g., Mentor's introduction). The sabotage and crystal ball discovery drive momentum well, but the resolution of the library's recovery feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the insect symphony hall and driftwood podium are vivid and thematically resonant. Sensory details (beetle arpeggios, conch-milk crystal) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich literary craft with layered metaphors (bitter honey tone, blue confetti surf). The ending's "gentle overturn" lingers, though the fever-fugue Mentor encounter leans slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery. No clichés; the game show host's absurdity amid sacred knowledge subverts expectations. Only minor quibble: "bitter honey" risks overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite density of elements. The crystal ball and sabotage feel organic, though "gentle overturn" could be more sharply defined in the climax.</comment>
