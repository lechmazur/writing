<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's voice is distinct, and their motivation to embrace non-violence is clear, though slightly abstract. Their actions align well with their poetic introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically between past and present, with a strong arc from harm to gentleness. Pacing is tight but not rushed, and transitions are smooth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway settings are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (pollen, dust, rattling windows) deepening the mood of eerie transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (violence as "snares disguised as similes") and symbolism (seeds as futures). Ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery. Avoids clich√©s, and the ghost's guidance feels inventive. Only minor nitpicks on phrasing ("empty abundance").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout piece with depth and cohesion.</comment>
