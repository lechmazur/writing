<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mercenary's spinelessness is compellingly subverted, and their shift from erasure to listening reveals nuanced layers. The apprentice's request for mentorship in refusal adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured with a clear arc—prophecy, refusal, reinterpretation—without feeling rushed. The dollhouse key's role as both trivial and pivotal is masterfully woven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The map room's curved walls and latticed light create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. "Luminous doubt" and the hush amplify tension exquisitely.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext: prophecy as cartography, silence as rebellion. The ending ("button sewn to an ocean") lingers. Literary devices (gears as tongues, light as code) are flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Defies tropes—mercenary as listener, key as catalyst. Original metaphors ("ferment into wars"). No AI clichés; voice is distinct and controlled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the theme of coded resistance. The brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant gaps. A standout for its layered ingenuity.</comment>
