<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The penitent memory thief's motivation is clear, nuanced, and deeply integrated into the story's fabric, revealing both remorse and a methodical approach to atonement. Their distinct voice and actions align perfectly with their role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from theft to restoration. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive, and the cause-and-effect logic (theft → spoilage → return) is compelling. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the "crack in reality" resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fruit preservation vault and the "hush" timeframe create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (jarred seasons, chiming bells) are masterful, and the setting amplifies the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (petals, toy block), layered subtext (method as morality), and an ending that lingers. Literary devices are wielded with precision, and the prose is both poetic and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The "icy warmth" tone and memory-thieving premise defy clichés. Metaphors ("the look you give a storm when it waters graves") are striking and fresh, with no AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Every element serves the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader with a resonant question: Can stolen things ever be fully returned?</comment>
