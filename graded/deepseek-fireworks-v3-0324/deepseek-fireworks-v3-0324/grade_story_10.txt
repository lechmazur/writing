<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character arc with clear motivation, though the transition from chef to duelist could be more fleshed out. The duality of pride and forgiveness is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The chest's revelation and hologram confrontation are effective, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the abandoned spaceport and server hum amplify the duelist's isolation. Sensory details (maggots, flickering hologram) are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (recipes as weapons/healing) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the sister's hologram could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "elasticize his heart"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "cheerless duelist" archetype leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
