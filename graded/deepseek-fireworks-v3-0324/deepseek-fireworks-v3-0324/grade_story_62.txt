<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "rarely honest" attribute could be more deeply explored. His voice is distinct, though his actions sometimes feel slightly detached from his grand ambition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc, but the connection between the sewer and amphitheater feels underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the ending resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The sewer and amphitheater contrast effectively, but their symbolic connection could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and subtext, but the central conflict (rewriting existence) lacks tangible stakes. Ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh, and the tone is consistent. Some phrases verge on overly ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy and ambition.</comment>
