<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wanderer's stoicism and motivation are clear, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His silence speaks volumes, but more nuance in his past would deepen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (damp earth, smudged charcoal eyes) elevating the setting. The training ground's "living" presence is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (floorboard, nightmares) and subtext. The dialogue crackles with tension, and the ending lingers. Only minor polish needed to reach perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("voice a blade wrapped in velvet"). Avoids clichés, though the "necessary lies" theme could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves the reader haunted—proof of its success within constraints.</comment>
