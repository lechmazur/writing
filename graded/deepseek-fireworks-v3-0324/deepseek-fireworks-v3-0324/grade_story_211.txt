<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear but his cheerfulness feels slightly forced against the despair. His actions align well with his gambler persona, though his 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the diary and spin-the-bottle driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels both inevitable and surprising.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and "unremembered future" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (shattered windows, rusted bottle) deepen the mood masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flames, duplication) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is chillingly purposeful, though the theme of power's corruption could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "cheerful despair" tone occasionally veers into contrivance. Metaphors (e.g., "skeletal hand") are fresh, though some phrasing borders on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, haunting tale. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with unsettling resonance.</comment>
