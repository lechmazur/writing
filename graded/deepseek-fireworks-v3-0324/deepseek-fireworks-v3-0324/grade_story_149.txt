<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's prophetic yet rebellious nature is compelling, but their motivation to unify minds could be more deeply explored. The wilted flower is a strong symbol, but its connection to their arc feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the laundromat and study serving as effective transitions. Pacing is excellent, though the stranger's abrupt introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (flickering lights, ink-scented stranger). The giant’s study is hauntingly evocative, though its sudden appearance slightly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flower, glimmering transitions) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the stranger’s role borders on cryptic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The prose is lyrical but purposeful, though the "haunting delight" tone occasionally feels overplayed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The brevity feels intentional, though the giant’s study could be more integrated earlier.</comment>
