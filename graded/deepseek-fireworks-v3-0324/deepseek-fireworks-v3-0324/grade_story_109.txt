<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's cold-natured yet rebellious demeanor is well-developed, and his motivation for his sister's remedy is clear and compelling. His reaction to the mitten reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mitten and altar driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (snow, frayed mitten) enhancing mood. The secret agent center feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (mitten as resilience) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of hope is subtly powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The folk remedy angle and mitten-as-key feel fresh, though the "close distance" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, leaving a lingering warmth. Creative and thoughtful.</comment>
