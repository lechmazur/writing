<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his existential struggle, though his "deserted" status could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the pond's ripples serving as a brilliant metaphor for revelation. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground grove's sensory details (metallic tang, ghostly hounds) are immersive and elevate the alchemist's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon as key, ripples as cipher) and a hauntingly resonant ending. Subtext about faith and patience is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "exultant grief" tone is fresh, though the "secret dog park" slightly strains cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on loss and rediscovery.</comment>
