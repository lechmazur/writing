<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's unsteadiness and the automaton bird's insistence create a compelling dynamic, though the sentinel's shift from confusion to defiance could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prophecy's trap revealed organically. Pacing is excellent, though the "between worlds" collision feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned docking bay and "cheerless ecstasy" tone are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (groaning machinery, flickering lights) enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the bird as witness, shredded letters as fragmented truth) and a resonant theme of defiance elevate this beyond surface-level sci-fi. The ending lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "coyly furious" bird and sentinel's mechanical hope are standout touches, though "ambush of fate" verges on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious micro-story that feels deliberate in its brevity. The elements serve the narrative, not vice versa, and the ending sparks reflection.</comment>
