<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions and dialogue revealing depth. His 'voice' is distinct, though his mischievousness could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the ending feels slightly abrupt. The connection between the sign and forbidden knowledge could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom village and dusk setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, feral atmosphere. The glowing mushrooms and mist are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (birdcage, chipped paint) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the confrontation with the elder could carry more emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The minstrel's dialogue and the village's illusions feel fresh, though some metaphors border on overused ("polished stones").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about truth and tradition.</comment>
