<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seamstress's timid yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, and her childhood promise drives her actions convincingly. Her transformation feels organic and resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the factory's closure and the temple-mill's transformation forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, blending industrial decay with mythic grandeur. Sensory details (whistle, dye scent, frayed fabric) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon as oracle, scoreboard as tapestry) and emotional resonance. The ending is both satisfying and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The seamstress's voice and the temple-mill concept feel fresh. Metaphors (e.g., "columns swaying like threads") are striking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, poignant whole. The brevity enhances impact, leaving a lingering sense of renewal.</comment>
