<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, with his cosmic fascination driving his actions. His "unlucky" trait adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sextant discovery and lizardman encounter driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, though the sparring feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with bioluminescent fungi and shifting walls creating a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "rasp of bitter honey") are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sextant as a cosmic key) and subtext (chaos as language). Ending is purposeful, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The lizard people and sentient weather feel inventive, though "spoken truths" leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic mystery.</comment>
