<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "outcast scholar" trait could be more deeply explored to justify his obsession with proving darkness isn't eternal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the confrontation with his shadow feels slightly rushed. Pacing is otherwise excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the garage and corridor settings enhancing the mystical tone. Sensory details (e.g., the shell's warmth, wind during flight) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (shell, shadow as doubt) is deftly handled, and the ending is satisfying. The theme of impermanent darkness resonates, though the "frantic peace" tone could be more consistently conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The flying carpet garage is inventive, but the "mirroring the soul" concept leans slightly generic in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
