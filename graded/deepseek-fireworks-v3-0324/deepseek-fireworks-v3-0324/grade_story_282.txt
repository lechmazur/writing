<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garrick's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past, but his "brash" nature could be more vividly shown through dialogue or action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the transition from forge to parking lot feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (dust, heat, light) enhancing the mythic tone. The discount store contrast is intriguing but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (medal, nautilus) and thematic depth. The ending is resonant, though the "dusty exuberance" tone could be more consistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("consciously wild") verge on overwrought. The concept of reciprocity could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the storyâ€™s core theme. The brevity feels deliberate, though the discount store setting could be more integral.</comment>
