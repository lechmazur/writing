<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The zealot's descent into madness is vividly portrayed, with his obsession with the bottle cap and treatise revealing his fractured psyche. However, his transition from denial to confession feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the jungle's encroachment mirroring the zealot's unraveling. The climax is chilling, though the initial setup could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor clashing with the jungle is masterfully evocative, creating a suffocating atmosphere. Sensory details (peeling wallpaper, mildew breath) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottle cap as hypocrisy, vines as guilt) and a haunting ending elevate this. The dialogue is sparse but potent, though the zealot's "theoretical" refrain borders on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, though the "earnest absurdity" tone occasionally clashes with the horror. The jungle's sentience feels fresh, but the zealot archetype is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive nightmare. The brevity amplifies the tension, and the lingering confession is deeply resonant.</comment>
