<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with collecting moments rather than physical stamps is compelling and well-integrated, though his motivation to learn magic could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between bootleg recordings and the carnival feels slightly forced. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bicycle-powered carnival is vividly rendered, and the faded orchard sign adds atmospheric depth. Sensory details (grinding gears, scent of apples) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (blank luggage tag, garnet) and subtext, but the dialogue with the magician leans toward clich√©. The ending resonates but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into familiar tropes (wise magician, "magic is belief"). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically assured, though some elements (carnival, recordings) feel more decorative than essential. Leaves a lingering, if slightly sentimental, impression.</comment>
