<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ranger's foolhardiness and steady creativity are well-integrated into his obsessive quest, though his distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the snow globe's crack serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
