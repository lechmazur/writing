<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions and reactions revealing depth. His 'voice' is distinct, though his mellow nature could be more dynamically challenged.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution of the overload feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details enhancing the antique airship and twilight setting. The ruler's connection to the bard's past is subtle but effective.</comment>
