<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chameleon actor's motivation is clear and compelling, blending rationality and impulsivity. His use of the doll’s dress as a symbol adds depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the cold-case mysteries, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the ending lacks full closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The palace and post-oil world are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sunlight through debris) enhancing atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the character’s mission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative use of constraints. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
