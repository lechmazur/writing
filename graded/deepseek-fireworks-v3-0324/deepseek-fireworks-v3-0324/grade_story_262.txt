<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vael's alien nature and human disguise are compelling, but his shift from fear to trust feels slightly rushed. Lila's curiosity and immediate acceptance could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the tile and music driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution could linger longer for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bathhouse-turned-concert-hall is vividly rendered, and the organ's reverberations enhance the atmosphere. Sensory details (steam, sound) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tile as fragmented knowledge, music as connection) and a resonant theme of mutual rescue elevate the story. Dialogue is purposeful, though Lila's lines verge on overly earnest.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "crucible" for the bathhouse). Minor AI tells: "righteously flawed" feels slightly forced, and Lila's instant devotion borders on tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the tile and organ serving the story's heart. The ending lingers, though Vael's laughter could feel more earned.</comment>
