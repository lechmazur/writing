<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias Veyra's motivations are clear and layered, blending his gambling persona with deeper philosophical and environmental concerns. His telekinetic dice and family tradition add unique texture to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the chip's mystery, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the rebellion's stakes. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but the ending could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The navigation room's "sacred disorder" and dying star system are vividly rendered, with the tapestry fragment and holoscreens creating a rich, immersive atmosphere that supports the thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, tapestry) and subtext (rebirth vs. ruin). The ending is purposeful, though the rebellion's scale could be more sharply felt. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original blending of sci-fi and mythic elements, though the telekinetic dice flirt with tropes. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, but some descriptors verge on generic ("dying sun").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the tapestry and chip driving the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic reflection, though the climax could linger longer.</comment>
