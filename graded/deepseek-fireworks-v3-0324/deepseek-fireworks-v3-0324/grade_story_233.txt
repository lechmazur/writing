<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's transformation from naive to keeper of whispers is subtly but effectively conveyed. Their motivation is clear, though their initial naivety could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "between commercials" element slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vault's virtual energy and dreamlike atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (warmth, hum, scent) are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (statue as bridge, tomb of stories) and a hauntingly poetic style elevate this. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, lingering in the reader's mind.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The lullaby-to-fate motif and virtual vault feel inventive. Minor quibble: "seeds of understanding" borders on overused phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers long after reading.</comment>
