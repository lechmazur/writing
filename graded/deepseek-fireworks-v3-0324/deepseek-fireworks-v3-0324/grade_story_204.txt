<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession as a cuddler adds depth, but her motivation to overcome prejudice feels underdeveloped. Eli's tension is hinted at but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the ticket punch, but the farmer's market encounter feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and "ancient novelty" tone are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (decay/transformation) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict could be sharper. Dialogue is sparse but natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "unusually usual" phrasing stands out as fresh. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though some elements (e.g., prejudice) could be more fully realized.</comment>
