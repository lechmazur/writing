<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's wry, aloof demeanor and their existential musings on time are vividly portrayed, but their ultimate vanishing act feels slightly abrupt given the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically rich, but the transition from chalk markings to vanishing could be smoother. Pacing is strong for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cargo hold's eerie, cosmic atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (chalk dust, dial tone) deepening the mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (chalk as time, dust as paths) and a haunting ending elevate the story. Minor quibble: the "gentle harshness" tone wobbles in a few lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "lullaby sung through gritted teeth"). Avoids clich√©s and AI-generic phrasing impressively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole, though the chalk's role borders on over-literary. Leaves a lingering, melancholic resonance.</comment>
