<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lapsed priest's internal conflict and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his confusion and defiance adding depth. His actions align well with his abandoned faith and hunger for something undefined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the abacus and snow patterns driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned, and the pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and "dull radiance" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (snow patterns, groaning stalks) enhance the mood and reinforce the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (abacus as sin, snow as guidance) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of defiance against complacency resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors (bean stalks as ribs, abacus as tally) are inventive, and the emotional nuance feels authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished piece where every element serves the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and deeply thematic.</comment>
