<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's guilt and motivation are vividly portrayed, with clear alignment between his actions and his quest for self-forgiveness. His distinct voice and emotional depth stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from guilt to potential renewal. Pacing is effective, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's chamber and morning setting are richly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (charred herbs, spectral light) deepen immersion and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (the bowl as a mirror of guilt, the witch's laughter as confrontation). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "chips gleaming like stars") are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering impact—forgiveness as a journey, not a destination.</comment>
