<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor's brooding nature and motivation to escape are clear and consistent, but his artistic side could be more deeply explored to fully justify his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the "dance of dust" as a catalyst feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, and the car wash's mechanical contrast with the sculptor's yearning enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glasses, dust, clay) and a haunting ending elevate the story. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "webs of intrigue" thread feels underdeveloped. The tone avoids clich√©, and the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of escape.</comment>
