<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marjorie's motivation is clear and consistent, her use of the stuffed toy ear reveals depth, and her "dutifully defiant" nature aligns well with her actions. However, her distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and effective pacing. The future bulletins drive the narrative logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "amber prison" kitchen and sensory details (thyme, warmth) create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the story's mood and supports Marjorie's emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, symbolism (the ear as a conduit), and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of quiet rebellion is woven deftly into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "amber prison") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering sense of hope and subtlety, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
