<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ambassador's fierce yet introspective nature is compelling, though her "methodically playful" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated in her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic holds, but the zeppelin setting feels underutilized as a driver of tension. The resolution is elegant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest assetâ€”rust, static, and the ghost costume create a haunting, tactile mood. The zeppelin's decay mirrors the theme perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered subtext elevate the prose, though some metaphors verge on overworked (e.g., "ink bleeding into her skin"). The ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable lyrical cadences. The "calm frenzy" tone is fresh, but the letters' mechanism feels familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette that wrestles with weighty themes. The brevity serves its dreamlike logic, though some elements strain credulity.</comment>
