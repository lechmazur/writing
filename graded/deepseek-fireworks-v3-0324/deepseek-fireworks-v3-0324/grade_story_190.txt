<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The smuggler's cautious yet impulsive nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to master empathy through theft is intriguing. However, his "enthusiastic apathy" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the painter's confession could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drought-stricken world is richly evoked, and the butterfly's connection to musical memories enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (butterfly as music/memory) and a resonant theme. The ending is purposeful, though the painter's subplot slightly distracts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "meticulously impulsive" duality and the butterfly's symbolism stand out. Minor quibble: "enthusiastic apathy" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. The smuggler's internal conflict elevates it.</comment>
