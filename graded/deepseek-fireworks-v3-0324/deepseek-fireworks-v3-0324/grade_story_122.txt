<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is intriguing but slightly nebulous; his "patiently frantic" energy is vivid, though his ultimate purpose could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled and coherent, with a clear arc from defiance to ambiguous resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—the sky burial site and storm pulse with sensory detail, amplifying the story's existential tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bridle as relic/conductor) and layered subtext elevate this beyond surface action. The ending lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "shadows fracturing sunlight into jagged shards") avoid cliché. Minor over-reliance on "refraction" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that leverages constraints to feel deliberate. The unresolved tension is a strength.</comment>
