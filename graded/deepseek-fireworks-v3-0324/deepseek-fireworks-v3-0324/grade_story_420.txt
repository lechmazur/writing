<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sculptor's hope and ambition are clear, but her internal conflict and nuanced reaction to the ring's resistance elevate her beyond a one-dimensional archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect logic holds, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The ring's transformation is earned but could benefit from more granular tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”the "excited boredom" and fossilized bones create a haunting, liminal space that mirrors the sculptor's creative struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (light/boundaries, dust/rebirth), though the theme of artistic redemption slightly overshadows subtler layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh imagery (e.g., "theory of freedom"), though the "implode" metaphor edges toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with a lingering sense of artistic alchemy. The word limit feels like a strength, not a constraint.</comment>
