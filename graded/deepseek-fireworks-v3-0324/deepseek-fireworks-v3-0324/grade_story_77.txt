<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys's introverted empathy is well-integrated, but their motivation to "champion the outcasts" could be more deeply explored. Their actions align, but the emotional depth feels slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect. The marionette's reassembly as a symbol of unity is effective, though the warlords' arrival feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout is vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., "brittle spines whispering") enhancing atmosphere. The setting and objects (starfish, journal) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (marionette, starfish) and subtext ("brokenness as strength"). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of unity resonates. Dialogue is purposeful, though Ryn's "drowsy enthusiasm" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The starfish and marionette metaphors feel fresh. Some phrases ("drowsy enthusiasm") border on overly poetic, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about collective resilience.</comment>
