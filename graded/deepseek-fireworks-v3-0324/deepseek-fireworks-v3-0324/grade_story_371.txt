<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character voice and motivation, though the "broke swashbuckler" archetype leans slightly generic. His sacrifice of the hatpin for kindness is poignant and well-executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, coherent plot with clear cause-and-effect. The marbles' symbolic resonance and the enforcers' intrusion escalate tension effectively within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; neon-soaked cyberpunk setting is vivid and immersive. Sensory details (holographic fabric, marble hum) deepen the world's texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative storytelling with layered themes (kindness as rebellion). Symbolism (marbles as constellations) and subtext elevate the narrative. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal clich√©s, though "fervent apathy" feels slightly forced. Emotional nuance (e.g., vendor's desperation) avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; brevity feels intentional. Lingering warmth in the alley lingers, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
