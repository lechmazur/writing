<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The envoy's sneering demeanor and shifting reverence are compelling, but his motivation ("to cup starlight") feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with clear cause-and-effect, though the climax's abruptness slightly undermines the buildup. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfulâ€”sensory details (rotting fruit, metallic soil) and the paradoxical "furiously tranquil" air create immersive, haunting tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vines as constellations, glass shard as key) and lyrical prose elevate the story. Ending resonates but could linger longer emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "rambling destiny" edges toward purple prose. Celestial vines and starlight-capturing are fresh, but the envoy's sneer leans tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a haunting question: is capturing eternity triumph or folly?</comment>
