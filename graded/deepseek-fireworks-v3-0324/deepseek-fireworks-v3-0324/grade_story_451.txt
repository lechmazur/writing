<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but the twin's sudden appearance feels slightly rushed. Their dynamic, however, is richly hinted at.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the prophecy's shift from global to personal feels abrupt. The cave confrontation is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain and cave setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the tension. The farmers market contrast is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baseball, shadows) and emotional depth. The ending is satisfying but could linger more on the paradox's implications.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Some phrases verge on clich√© ("veiled in crystal shadows"), but the core idea is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the twin's reveal could be more nuanced.</comment>
