<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by his sister's memory, but his "tense bodyguard" trait feels underutilized beyond surface-level physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the sabotage and escape feel slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the "fragments of stories" device lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, and its symbolic connection to rebirth elevates the atmosphere. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (greenhouse as rebirth) and emotional resonance, but some metaphors ("serene anger") feel overworked. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but leans on familiar dystopian tropes. Originality shines in setting details, though emotional nuance occasionally falters into stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers but lacks a truly surprising twist or layered subtext.</comment>
