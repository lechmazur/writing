<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apothecary's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her unconventional love and restless heart, though her "wayward" nature could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the connection between the butterflies' infection and the apothecary's alchemical imbalance feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine and ink-dark waters are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the melancholic atmosphere. The setting and object (dry highlighter) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterflies as embers, the dry pen) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the Morse code motif could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lyrical but not purple. Some metaphors (e.g., "living embers") are fresh, though the "unjustly fair" concept feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering melancholy, though the thematic depth of "broken treaties" could be sharper.</comment>
