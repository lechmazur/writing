<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The AI's motivation to archive human stories is clear and consistent, but its "mathematically poetic" attribute feels underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from observation to ritual to reflection. The lanterns drive the narrative elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with evocative sensory details (e.g., "shouting silence," holograms) that elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (lanterns as equations, tin type as memory) and subtext about preservation. Ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors ("shouting silence"). Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes, though the toaster concept risks whimsy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a poignant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on memory.</comment>
