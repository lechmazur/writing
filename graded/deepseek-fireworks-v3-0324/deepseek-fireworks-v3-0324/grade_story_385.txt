<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's meddlesome nature and singular motivation are clear, but his manipulative trait feels underutilized. The skates add intrigue but their connection to his personality could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the symbols, but the ritual's logic feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the footprints' significance could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyscraper and beach create a striking, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (salt-scent, rusted skates) are evocative, but the hospital ward's tie to the setting is weak.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (skates, seeds) is potent, and the ending is satisfyingly ambiguous. However, the stranger's dialogue feels abrupt, and the theme of manipulation could be richer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "scattered seeds" metaphor borders on clich√©. The skates and skyscraper are fresh, but the hospital timeframe feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the hospital and manipulative traits are underdeveloped. The story lingers, but some threads (footprints) lack payoff.</comment>
