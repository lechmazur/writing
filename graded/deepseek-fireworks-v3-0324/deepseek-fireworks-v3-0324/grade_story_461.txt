<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc. The pendant's role as a bridge is subtly foreshadowed, but the meditation method could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—spellbook study and childhood hush blend seamlessly. Sensory details (dragonfly shimmer, brittle pages) enhance immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the story feels deliberate and layered. Leaves a lingering resonance of healing and connection.</comment>
