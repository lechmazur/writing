<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' cynicism and truth-curse are well-integrated, driving his actions and dialogue with sharp consistency. His motivation to provoke evolution is clear, though his vindictiveness could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the pencil box and moon phases logically driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the attendant's petrification resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (peeling stripes, tarnished hinges) enhancing the eerie mood. Crows and moonlight deepen the thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (thread of fate, petrification) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the attendant's transformation could resonate more emotionally.</comment>
