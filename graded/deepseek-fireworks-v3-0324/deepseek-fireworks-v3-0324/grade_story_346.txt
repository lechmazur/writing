<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The boastful warrior's arc from arrogance to quiet certainty is compelling, though his initial bravado could be more sharply contrasted with his later introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic is cohesive and driven by the warrior's actions, though the transition from nest to battlefield feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The wasp nest's eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (lint, balloon pops) deepening the disorientation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lint as truth, nest as mind) and a hauntingly ambiguous ending elevate this beyond mere surrealism. The prose is taut yet evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("balloon pops like gunfire in a dream") and a distinct voice avoid clich√©. The warrior's unraveling feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified whole, with the brevity serving the story's dreamlike intensity. The lingering question of reality lingers powerfully.</comment>
