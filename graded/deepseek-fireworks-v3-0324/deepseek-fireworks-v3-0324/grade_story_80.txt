<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and compelling, though his "ingeniously clueless" trait could be more consistently shown. His quiet mania and obsession with the riddle drive the narrative well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. The riddle's resolution and the door's reveal are satisfying, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster and haunted inns create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the cold brass doorknob) immerse the reader, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (time as a library) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the creature's introduction feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The riddle's twist and Elias' flawed brilliance stand out, though some phrases ("quiet mania") verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection. A few tighter edits could elevate it further.</comment>
