<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's reformation is compelling, but his transition from con artist to guardian feels slightly rushed. His "dishonestly honest" grin is a strong touch, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphor (construction zone as detour). Pacing is strong, but the medical subplot could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, with sensory details (antiseptic, damp leaves) enhancing atmosphere. The yodeling adds whimsy without breaking immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact is strong, especially Elias's final act. Symbolism (sheet music as redemption) works well, but the ending verges on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the setting and Elias's voice. Some phrases ("earnest whimsy") risk cliché, but the core concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, though the medical thread feels tangential. The brevity serves the story’s emotional punch.</comment>
