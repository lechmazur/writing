<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The farmer's motivation is clear and consistent, with his defiance and hope shining through. His use of the magician’s deck adds depth, though his 'typically atypical' trait could be more explicitly woven into actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the farmer's journey from rebellion to departure feeling organic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the sea's role could be slightly more integrated early on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is evocative and immersive, with the plains and sea serving as potent symbols. Sensory details (whispering grasses, salt-kissed wind) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seeds, cards, bottles) and lyrical prose create lasting impact. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the 'song of boundaries' could be more consistently threaded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The magician’s deck repurposed for survival is particularly inventive. Nuanced emotion and subtext elevate it beyond typical post-apocalyptic fare.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. Elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a sense of defiant hope.</comment>
