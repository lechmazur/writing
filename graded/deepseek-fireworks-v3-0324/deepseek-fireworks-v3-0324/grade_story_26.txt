<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with clear motivation, though his backstory could be more fleshed out. His obsession with hidden patterns and the bell's glyphs drives the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bell's resonance serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent, and the story feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk setting are immersive and enhance the story's mood. Sensory details (glowing mechanisms, resonant bell) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (glyphs, prison walls) and a haunting ending elevate the story. The theme of brokenness and possibility resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "singularly plural"). Avoids clich√©s and demonstrates a distinct, nuanced style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The story feels deliberate and lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond its brevity.</comment>
