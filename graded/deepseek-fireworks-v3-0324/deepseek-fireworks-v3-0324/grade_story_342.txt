<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's dreamlike logic and cause-effect relationships hold, though the labyrinth's shifting nature risks slight incoherence. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels intentional.</comment>
