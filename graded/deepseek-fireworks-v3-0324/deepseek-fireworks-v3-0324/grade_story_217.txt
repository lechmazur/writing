<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's rebellious nature and motivation are clear, but his "underestimated" aspect feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The call's intensification drives the story effectively, though the haunted house's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The ephemeral gloom and haunted house work well together, though the "sadly joyful" tone could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes emotion. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of adaptation could be deeper. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("fiery, unforgettable"). Emotional resonance is shown, not told, though the "art of adaptation" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering thought, though the haunted house's significance could be stronger.</comment>
