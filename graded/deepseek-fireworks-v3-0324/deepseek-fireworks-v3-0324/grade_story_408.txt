<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "valiantly bored" demeanor and bird-mapping obsession create a distinct voice, though his transition to vigilance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the rival's introduction feels abrupt. The nail's significance ties the arc together neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (storms, rust, whispers) amplifying the coy malevolence. The setting feels integral to the conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nail, maps) and subtext (secrets, grudges). The ending is purposeful, though the rival's hunger could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "valiantly bored" phrasing is fresh, though "xenial" feels slightly forced. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering unease about the orchard's secrets.</comment>
