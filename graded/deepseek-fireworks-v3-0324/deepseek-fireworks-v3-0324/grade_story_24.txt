<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear and distinct, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His use of dentures as a prop is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the bookstore and the puppet shows feels tenuous. The ending is satisfying but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with vivid sensory details. The bookstore setting is masterfully rendered, though the timeframe ("lull before an apologetic text") feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and subtext, but the emotional impact wavers. The theme of storytelling as warmth is compelling but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés, though some phrases border on overly ornate. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
