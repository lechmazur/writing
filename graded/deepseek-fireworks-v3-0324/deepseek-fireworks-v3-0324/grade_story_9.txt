<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The soothsayer's sarcasm and panic create a distinct voice, but their motivation to "shape destiny" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the puzzle box's mechanics could be more explicitly linked to the environmental theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (neon, sand, burnt plastic) immerse the reader; the billboard maze and desert clash brilliantly with the concept of stewardship.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seed, water rings) and subtext, but the ending's resolution leans slightly on clich√© ("hope in a hellscape").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sand glittered like shattered glass"), though the sarcasm occasionally overshadows nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the environmental message feels somewhat tacked on rather than fully integrated.</comment>
