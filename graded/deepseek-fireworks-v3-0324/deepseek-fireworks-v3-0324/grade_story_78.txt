<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The late-blooming hero's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with the spyglass and her father's legacy. Her actions reveal resilience and a quiet determination, though her "softly militant" attribute could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spyglass and the child's fall serving as pivotal moments. The cosmic balance theme ties the beginning and end together elegantly, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rusted pipes, wheat stalks) enhancing the atmosphere. The sky's tear and the spyglass create a haunting, cohesive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the cracked spyglass as a lens for loss) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the theme of cosmic balance could be explored with more nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("softly militant") verge on contrived. The spyglass and rooftop farm feel fresh, though the "gravity of loss" leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity works, but the cosmic balance theme could be more fully realized.</comment>
