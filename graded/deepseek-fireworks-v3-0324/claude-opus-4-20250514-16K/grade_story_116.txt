<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear, and her actions are consistent with her rational yet nostalgic approach to excavating lost gardens. Her voice is distinct, though her backstory could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the polaroids and map-building driving the narrative forward logically. The ending hints at resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sky-lounge and endless city are vividly rendered, with sensory details (starlight on the watch band, shadows in photographs) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of lost boundaries.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken watch band as frozen time) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The central conflict—reclaiming swallowed histories—is compelling and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The juxtaposition of "subjectively rational" analysis with poetic excavation feels fresh. Minor quibble: "laconic exuberance" isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette that lingers. The constraints of length feel intentional, and the interplay of elements (watch band, photographs, sky-lounge) is masterful.</comment>
