<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kenji's depth is compelling—his late start, gentleness as rebellion, and 'faithfully unfaithful' nature are richly woven into actions and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with coded sundial and crystal discovery logically culminating his lifelong wait. Minor pacing quibble in the middle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (matchbox as vessel, sundial as cipher) and subtext about time and gentleness. Ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no tropes, fresh metaphors ("universe in a cupped hand"), and nuanced emotions shown through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s soul; brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant questions about time and belonging.</comment>
