<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions reveal depth, and his "elegantly clumsy" voice is distinct. However, his ghost-seeing ability could be explored more deeply for full dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost tour subplot feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the sand castle lab and ghosts are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., flower crown's perfume) enhancing atmosphere. Only minor refinement needed in temporal grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (echoes, crumbling crown) and subtext. Ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "dissonance of silence" concept could be more fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Nuanced emotions avoid cliché, though the Victorian ghost trope leans slightly generic. Style is purposeful and distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. Elements serve the story elegantly, but the lunch break timeframe feels ancillary rather than essential.</comment>
