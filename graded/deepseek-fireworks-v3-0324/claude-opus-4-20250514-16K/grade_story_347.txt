<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's dual identity as a plant whisperer and physicist is intriguing, but her transition from concealment to revelation could be more nuanced. The shoelace motif is clever but slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the thought experiment serving as a perfect vessel for the story's philosophical and scientific exploration. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The workshop setting is vivid and immersive, with the fusion of machinery and flora creating a hauntingly original atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., pollen, grinding gears) are deftly deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story’s blend of lyrical prose and scientific inquiry is stunning. The metaphorical weight of photosynthesis as perpetual motion is profound, and the ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "time folded within the thought experiment") and a subversion of tropes. No clichés or AI-generated flatness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking gem. The constrained length feels deliberate, and the interplay of elements elevates the narrative beyond its premise.</comment>
