<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martha’s duality ("cynically gentle") is sharply defined and drives her revolutionary acts, with clear motivation rooted in oppression. Her actions align perfectly with her established traits, and her distinct voice emerges through subtle, purposeful narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with lunar tracking and time-machine baking creating a logical, high-stakes arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the garage's introduction feels slightly abrupt. Cause/effect relationships are strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mystical realism is rendered vividly through sensory details (lavender, flour dust) and the eerie sentience of shadows. The garage’s war-era relic status and lunar symbolism deepen the atmosphere, seamlessly supporting the rebellion theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors (bread as revolution), subtext (yeast as dissent), and a chillingly satisfying ending. The story lingers, blending poetic language with sharp political allegory. Every device serves the narrative’s emotional and intellectual weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original—no tropes or clichés. The conceit (botanical time-machine rebellion) feels wholly fresh, with nuanced emotions and precise, unconventional descriptors ("yeast of justice"). Style is distinctive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity enhances tension, and the story’s depth suggests deliberate artistry, not constraint. Leaves the reader haunted by its revolutionary fervor and layered symbolism.</comment>
