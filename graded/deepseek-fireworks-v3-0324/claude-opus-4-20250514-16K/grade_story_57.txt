<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lady Pemberton’s submissive facade contrasts brilliantly with her sharp awareness and decisive actions. Her motivation (protecting the moths) is clear and compelling, revealed through subtle actions like the letter opener’s use.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with every action (eavesdropping, jamming the lock, sabotaging the chemical) driving toward a satisfying resolution. Pacing is impeccable, balancing tension with brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse-turned-workshop setting is richly atmospheric, blending aristocratic pretense with clandestine danger. Echo chambers and moonlight enhance the mood, though sensory details could be more vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the letter opener as both tool and symbol, layered subtext (kindness as weapon), and a resonant ending. Literary devices (e.g., "jeweled pendants") elevate the prose without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh and original, avoiding clichés. Lady Pemberton’s duality and the moths’ symbolism feel inventive. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told (e.g., her "small smile" post-rescue).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, standout piece. Elements serve the story seamlessly; the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering satisfaction. Creative and deeply human.</comment>
