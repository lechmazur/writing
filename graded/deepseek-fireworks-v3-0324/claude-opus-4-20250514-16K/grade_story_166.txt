<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Meredith's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her ghostly nature and the orchard's survival. Her "solemnly silly" demeanor adds charm without undermining her purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and completeness within the tight word limit. The plastic straw's role as a conduit drives the narrative elegantly, though the logistics of weaving through fate could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., steam, ice fruit, wind-chime laughter) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (straw as bridge, perforations as fate) and emotional resonance. The ending crystallizes theme and purpose without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("laughter like wind chimes of icicles") and nuanced emotional subtext avoid cliché. The premise feels wholly original, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity serves the story’s lyricism, leaving a haunting aftertaste of interspecies connection.</comment>
