<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, with her silent rage and meticulous revenge revealing depth. Marcus's recognition and trembling hands add nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect. The pacing balances urgency and deliberation, though the steampunk setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is evocatively described, but its connection to the core conflict is minimal. Sensory details (steam, brass) enhance mood but don't deeply integrate.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (mixtapes, sticker sheet) and emotional subtext. The ending's emptiness lingers, showing rather than telling the hollowness of revenge.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "hyperactively serene" contradiction and savage grace tone are standout stylistic choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's theme. The brief length feels purposeful, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
