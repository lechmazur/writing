<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mercenary's trembling hands and frayed nerves are vividly portrayed, but her shift from violence to seeking understanding feels slightly abrupt. Her motivation is clear, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the amber spider driving the narrative logically. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the transition from rumor chains to the cathedral could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral and echoing hour create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (graffiti, spray paint rattling) are masterfully used to enhance mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as remembrance) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the emotional impact could delve deeper into the mercenary's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The amber altar concept is ingenious, though some metaphors (e.g., "prayers reimagined") verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of catharsis.</comment>
