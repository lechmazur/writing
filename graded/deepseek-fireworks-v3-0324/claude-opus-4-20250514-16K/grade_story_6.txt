<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Raven's skepticism and minstrel background are well-integrated; her motivation to outwit Malachi is clear and drives the plot. Her irreverent voice and calculated risk-taking reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the slingshot action and ink reversal serving as a clever, logical climax. Pacing is sharp, and cause/effect is seamless despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The factory's eerie atmosphere—steam vents, hidden ink—enhances tension. Sensory details (hisses, inverse graffiti) immerse the reader and amplify the thematic clash of truth/deception.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: dragon-scale symbolism, Malachi’s contract as subtext, and the ballad finale layers meaning. Ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant ("giving everything away").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh twist on trickster tropes; "impossibly plausible" ink reversal feels original. Language avoids cliché, and Raven's voice is distinct. Minor deduction for slightly predictable generosity theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive; elements serve the story elegantly. Length feels deliberate, and the lingering question of truth’s value elevates it beyond the plot.</comment>
