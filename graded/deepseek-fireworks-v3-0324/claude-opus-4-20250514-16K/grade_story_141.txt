<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's superstitious nature and engineering background create a compelling duality, though her motivation for transcendence could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the scavenger hunt leading organically to the cavern's revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The merging of urban and natural caverns is masterfully evoked; bioluminescent algae and geological rumbles amplify the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (notebook scars, lightning) and subtext (thresholds, matriarchal continuum). Ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original blend of engineering and mysticism. Avoids clich√©s; metaphors (thunder sleeping in limestone) are fresh and precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a story that lingers. The brevity feels intentional, not constrained.</comment>
