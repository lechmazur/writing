<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The knight's internal conflict and transformation are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and emotional depth. His "voice" carries weight, though some nuance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impeccable pacing and coherence within the tight word limit. The plot’s cause-and-effect logic is airtight, and the arc feels complete, though the ending leans slightly toward the didactic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and mirrored reflection are masterfully intertwined with the story’s mood. Sensory details (cold mirror, silver bell) elevate the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sword, rose, bell) and layered subtext. The ending’s emotional payoff is profound, though the lighthouse keeper’s dialogue borders on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but a few phrases ("beautiful breaking," "joyful agony") flirt with cliché. The theme of alchemical regret is fresh, but execution isn’t flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s brevity feels deliberate and potent. Elements harmonize seamlessly, leaving a lingering resonance. Minor stylistic overreach holds it back from perfection.</comment>
