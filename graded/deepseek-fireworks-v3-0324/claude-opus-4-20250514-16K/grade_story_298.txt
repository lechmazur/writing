<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin Wei's motivation and chameleon-like abilities are well-defined and drive the narrative. Her impulsive yet calculated nature adds depth, though a tad more background could solidify her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from mystery to revelation. Pacing is strong, though the climax's emotional weight slightly overwhelms the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace's decay and repurposing as a theater are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (sunlight, debris) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (doll’s dress, ventilation shafts) and layered subtext. The ending’s thematic resonance—transforming pain into understanding—elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Lin’s blending of performance and possession feels uniquely haunting. Minor quibble: "anxious serenity" slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful narrative where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impression.</comment>
