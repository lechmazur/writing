<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's streetwise nature and orphan background are deeply woven into her motivations and actions, revealing a clear, distinct character voice. Her reactions to the brooch and temple show nuanced development and alignment with her established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the brooch's reversed-time logic driving the narrative forward coherently. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the ending's philosophical weight slightly overshadows the resolution's clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard temple is a masterclass in atmosphere, with sensory details (burst figs, wild grapes) enhancing the eerie, timeless mood. The setting and object are inextricably linked, deepening the story's thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (paradox, symbolism) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the thematic density occasionally risks overshadowing emotional immediacy. Shows far more than it tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The reversed-time concept is handled with nuanced emotion and stylistic precision, avoiding AI-generic tendencies. A standout voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels intentional. The story leaves a haunting aftertaste of philosophical depth, elevating it beyond its assigned constraints.</comment>
