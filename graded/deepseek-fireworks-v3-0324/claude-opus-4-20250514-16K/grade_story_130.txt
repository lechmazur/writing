<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's "privately open" nature is subtly but effectively woven into her actions and reflections, revealing depth. Her voice feels distinct, and her growth is organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with the nest/phone discovery driving introspection. Pacing balances brevity and depth, though the ending resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard ship is richly evoked through sensory details (synthetic birds, hydroponic roots). Atmosphere amplifies themes of solitude and growth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (nest, phone) and layered subtext. Ending resonates emotionally, and the prose is lyrical without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Refreshingly original premise. Metaphors ("bloomed in solitude") feel fresh. Avoids tropes and AI-generic phrasing; emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering meditation on self-discovery.</comment>
