<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's character is well-developed, with her confusion and evolving understanding of the villagers' customs providing depth. Her motivation to "liberalize" the treaty is clear, though her internal conflict could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with a clear arc from confusion to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could linger a touch longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's themes. Sensory details (crystalline tears, warm key) deepen immersion, though more auditory/tactile descriptions would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (key, birds, salt) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the dialogue with the eldest could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The "joyfully tragic" motif and subterranean democracy feel fresh. Minor over-reliance on "counterpoint" as a thematic refrain.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about freedom’s paradoxes.</comment>
