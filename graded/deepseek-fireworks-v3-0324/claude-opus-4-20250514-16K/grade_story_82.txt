<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from reluctant caretaker to willing prophet is compelling and well-articulated, though her analytical playfulness could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the quantum-encrypted journals feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Neo-Tokyo's agricultural district is vividly rendered, with chrome trees and hidden sunrises creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (synthetic sap, fractal reflections) elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, blending symbolism (dragon tooth as bridge), emotional resonance, and layered themes. The ending is poignant, though the neural interface download risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original and fresh, with no clich√©s. The fusion of organic and digital memory is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of knowledge.</comment>
