<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirin's motivation is compelling and consistent; her pragmatic approach to prophecy and hidden ambition are vividly portrayed. Her "voice" is distinct, especially in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly paced and cohesive, with clear cause-and-effect (e.g., forging miracles leading to transformation). The storm's duality as blessing/threat resolves the arc meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thornweave is exquisitely rendered—gnarled, ancient, and alive. Sensory details (hammer strikes, roots humming melodies) deepen immersion and mirror Mirin's metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (hammer as legacy, bark as transcendence) and subtext (miracles as both service and corruption). The ending lingers with ominous inevitability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("bones into lightning") and a unique take on soothsaying. No clichés; the prose is lyrical yet precise, avoiding purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels intentional. The story leaves a haunting question: is transcendence liberation or loss?</comment>
