<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Samuel's grief and motivation are deeply felt, with his silent bell acting as a powerful symbol of loss. His "passionately indifferent" facade is subtly revealed, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, with the nightmares driving tension. The ending lingers effectively, though the parade float introduction feels slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive—gas lamps yielding to electric bulbs, confetti littering streets. Sensory details (coal-stained pocket, artificial smoke) deepen the tone of progress as erosion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the silent bell's symbolism, the duality of grief/progress, and Samuel’s emotional sleight of hand resonate. Literary devices are sharp, and the ending lands with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of emotion (e.g., "peculiar lightness grief sometimes brings") and fresh metaphors ("moss in sunless places") elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story’s thematic depth, leaving the reader with a lingering question about progress’s human cost.</comment>
