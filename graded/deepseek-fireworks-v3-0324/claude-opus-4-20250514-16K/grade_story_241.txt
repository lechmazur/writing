<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guide's soft voice and embroidered vest create a vivid, haunting character, but her backstory (dead daughter) feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and thematically coherent, though the blackout's purpose could be clearer. Pacing is exceptional for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating cloud cafe and its surreal atmosphere are masterfully rendered, with sensory details (wet silk, glowing threads) elevating the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tear-thread constellations) and a haunting theme of suppressed pain make this unforgettable. The ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original, though "blissful agony" verges on clich√©. The prose avoids purple excess, but a few phrases ("scream of silent plains") risk over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A nearly flawless fusion of elements, with only minor quibbles about the train's relevance. Leaves a profound emotional residue.</comment>
