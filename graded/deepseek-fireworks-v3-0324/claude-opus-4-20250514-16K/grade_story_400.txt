<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Morrigan's guarded nature and ambivalence are deeply woven into her actions and dialogue, revealing a nuanced, conflicted character. Her motivation—overcoming fear—is clear and drives the plot, though her "fiercely ambivalent" attribute could be more distinctly showcased.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with gathering ingredients and breaking silence serving as clear catalysts. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete, though the spirits' abrupt eruption could use slightly more foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The glacial orchard is vividly rendered, with sensory details (frost-kissed trees, steaming blood) elevating the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Morrigan's isolation and the ritual's stark beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (safety pin, frozen tears), layered subtext (tradition vs. despair), and a resonant ending. The chant's emotional impact is potent, though the spirits' reaction borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and haunting, with fresh metaphors ("silence cultivated like armor"). Avoids clichés, though the "dour amusement" tone occasionally wavers into straightforward melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a poignant, cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
