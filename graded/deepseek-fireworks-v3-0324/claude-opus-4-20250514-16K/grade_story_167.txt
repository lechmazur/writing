<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Chen's motivation is clear and consistent; her defiance of authority for truth is compelling. However, deeper exploration of her internal conflict could enhance her development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. The confined word limit is used effectively, though the climax with the Board could benefit from slightly more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The worldbuilding is vivid and immersive, with the capsule hotel and well serving as potent symbols. Sensory details (e.g., "temporal static," "artificial moonlight") elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "contaminating its pristine data banks" as metaphor). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of truth vs. suppression resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("calm... like deep water") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "earthbound flight" slightly strains the tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with emotional and intellectual weight.</comment>
