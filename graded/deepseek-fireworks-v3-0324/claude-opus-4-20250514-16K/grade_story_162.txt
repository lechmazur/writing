<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus and Chen are vividly drawn with clear, consistent motivations. The gambler facade and underlying trustworthiness create compelling depth, though Chen could benefit from more distinct dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action logically advancing the mystery. Pacing is superb for the word limit, though the island's significance could be hinted at earlier for smoother coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The workshop and island settings are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (yellowed edges, concrete floors) enhancing tension. The "hammered repose" tone slightly clashes with the urgency of the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("island sand," "electricity" of understanding) and layered conflict elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but risks being overly neat for the moral weight of the secret.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh takes on trust and chaos avoid clich√©s. The blueprint fragment is original, though the "shared secret" trope feels familiar. Nuanced emotions (exhaustion, relief) resonate authentically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. Elements serve the story, but the workshop's connection to the island could be sharper. Leaves a haunting question: What was buried?</comment>
