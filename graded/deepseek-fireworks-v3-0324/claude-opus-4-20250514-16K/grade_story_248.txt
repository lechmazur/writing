<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's cybernetic instability and desperation are vividly portrayed, though her transition from despair to resolve could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight, escalating plot with a clever twist—prophecy as sabotage—though the frenetic finale slightly strains coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting, cohesive whole—short but potent, with lingering questions about truth and sacrifice.</comment>
