<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and her "plain face as a weapon" is a strong, original trait. Her actions align well with her goal of collecting games, and her resilience is subtly shown through her modifications to the drill.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The barbershop quartet gossip as a secret network is inventive, and the pacing avoids feeling rushed despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "city of forgotten fountains" is vividly rendered, and the whimsical yet melancholic atmosphere enhances the story’s themes. Sensory details (e.g., quartet harmonies, rain pauses) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft—symbolism (games as joy preserved), evocative metaphors ("moss-covered cherubs"). Ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, with strong subtext about reclaiming forgotten pleasures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise and voice. Avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("plain as Tuesday soup"). Emotional depth is shown, not told, and the narrative maintains consistent, distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingers in the mind due to its unique blend of whimsy and melancholy, with clear thematic depth.</comment>
