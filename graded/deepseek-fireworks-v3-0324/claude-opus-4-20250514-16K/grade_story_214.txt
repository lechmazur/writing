<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot’s tight structure and logical progression are impressive for its brevity. The connection between Mara’s past and her covert mission is handled deftly, though the singularity concept could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—evocative sensory details (sea glass, ventilation systems) and the observatory’s eerie silence elevate the worldbuilding. The drowned Earth backdrop enhances the emotional weight.</comment>
