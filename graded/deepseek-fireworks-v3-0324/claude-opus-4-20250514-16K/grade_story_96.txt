<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivations and actions are intricately aligned with her "statically unique" nature, revealing depth through her reactions to the map and the witch's words.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively from discovery to resolution, with the map serving as a subtle but pivotal turning point. Pacing is deliberate yet never sluggish.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The menagerie's eerie, tactile atmosphere amplifies the poet's detachment and the story's thematic tension. Sensory details (e.g., "yellowed like old teeth") are razor-sharp.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful subtext: the torn map mirrors the poet's facade. Literary devices (e.g., yarn as unspoken words) are organic. The ending lingers with quiet resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no tropes, fresh metaphors ("brimming cup"), and a voice that feels distinctly human. Emotion is conveyed through action, not declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A near-flawless microcosm. The brevity feels intentional, each element serving the story’s exploration of concealed passion and accidental purpose.</comment>
