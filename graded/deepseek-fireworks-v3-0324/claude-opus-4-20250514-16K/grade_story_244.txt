<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's guilt and resolve are sharply defined, driving her actions with clarity. Her "reservedly bold" voice and katana's weight reinforce her complex persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is taut and purposeful, with the mask's revelation and Kira's confrontation forming a cohesive arc. Minor pacing strain in mid-section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Neon shop and decaying rosebush create a haunting, textured atmosphere. Faulty wiring and shifting carvings amplify unease masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (petals, neon as veins) is striking. Ending resonates, though dialogue feels slightly expository near climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (neon tubes like "exposed veins") avoid cliché. Guilt's labyrinthine scars feel original and visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified whole. The rosebush’s petal and mask’s weight linger as deliberate, potent motifs.</comment>
