<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's claustrophobia and her profession as an underwater explorer create a compelling contrast, but her motivation to study human behaviors could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the beginning and end feels slightly unresolved. The tea house serves as a strong focal point, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater tea house is vividly imagined, and sensory details (taste, touch) enhance the atmosphere. The "hush of improbable beginnings" adds mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (jam as preserved emotions) and shows rather than tells. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The jam-tasting method is inventive, though the healing touch feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively executed, though some elements (like the healing touch) could be better integrated. The length feels deliberate and well-managed.</comment>
