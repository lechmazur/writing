<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blacksmith's indifference is a compelling contrast to his meticulous task, revealing depth through subdued actions rather than dialogue. His motivation is clear but could benefit from a touch more personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with precision, leveraging the tight word limit to create a complete arc. The covenant's sealing feels inevitable yet satisfying, though the "rising from rubble" concept is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—phosphorescent moss, ossuary dust, and echoing bells create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. The catacombs and cathedral are symbiotically tied to the ritual.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (chalice = shattered faith, ribbon = faded beauty) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the covenant's rules could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clichés. The blacksmith's quiet ritual feels fresh, but the "collection of objects" trope risks familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. The brevity amplifies its power, and the mystic tone resonates beyond the final line.</comment>
