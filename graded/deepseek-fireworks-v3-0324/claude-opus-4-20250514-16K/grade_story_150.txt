<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rex's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vividly realized, with clear motivation and growth. His "saturated ambivalence" and eventual clarity are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the dice and prophecies driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory is richly immersive, with sensory details (hissing steam, copper floors) enhancing the eerie, prophetic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (dice as cosmic tools) and subtext (theft as destiny). Ending is resonant and thematically unified.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("rehearse for the moment when running becomes returning"). Avoids clich√©s and AI tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize brilliantly. The word limit feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about selfhood and fate.</comment>
