<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's reserved yet revolutionary nature is compelling, and her motivation to preserve spiritual practices is clear and consistent. Her "honestly dishonest" trait adds depth, though her dialogue could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Mira's agitation of the garden driving the narrative. Cause-and-effect is logical, and the pacing balances urgency and contemplation well within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum garden is vividly realized, blending scientific and spiritual imagery flawlessly. Sensory details (bats' echolocation, music box's melody) immerse the reader and amplify the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story excels in layered symbolism (music box as rebellion, bats as messengers) and subtext (determinism vs. faith). The ending lingers, though the inspector's scene feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "probability roses"). The prose is polished yet purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate ("sacred geometries formed between particle pairs").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, with the garden serving as both setting and metaphor. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on preservation and resistance.</comment>
