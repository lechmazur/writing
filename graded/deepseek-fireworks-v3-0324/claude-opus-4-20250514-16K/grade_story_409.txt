<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply integrated, with his bruised physicality mirroring his emotional state. However, his "skillful incompetence" could be more sharply defined in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the attic's discovery serving as a potent catalyst. The resolution feels earned, though the sculptor's parallelism slightly overburdens the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphereâ€”clockwork animals and dust motes create a tactile, haunting setting. The sculptor's chisel motif is slightly overplayed but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (clay shard as self-truth) and subtext (failure as defiance). The prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though the "standing for something" theme leans toward abstraction. The clockwork menagerie is a standout inventive touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich vignette. The brevity feels intentional, though the sculptor metaphor slightly strains the story's focus.</comment>
