<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Marissa's motivations are intricate and vividly rendered, with her ghostwriting past and burning of journals revealing a multi-layered psyche. Her actions align perfectly with her yearning for authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each journal stanza acting as a deliberate step toward liberation. Pacing is masterful—no excess, no gaps—though the fungal orchard’s role could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Every metaphor (corrosion, luminescent decay) serves thematic depth. The ending’s quiet triumph lingers, and the prose’s lyrical precision shows rare mastery of craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startling originality in conceit and execution—no tropes, no filler. The fusion of political ghostwriting and bioluminescent surrealism feels entirely fresh, with human flaws subtly etched.</comment>
