<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation and personality are clearly defined, with her grandfather's influence shaping her actions and perspective. Her "mild zealot" nature is subtly but effectively conveyed through her obsession with patterns and the emotional weight she assigns to the currency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from curiosity to revelation. The connection between the foreign money, the lab, and sacrifice is logically woven, and the pacing feels deliberate yet unforced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and historical context are richly atmospheric, blending scientific and emotional tones seamlessly. The sensory details (e.g., amber light, fluttering peso) deepen immersion without overwhelming.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—layered symbolism (currency as faith, patterns as human trust), evocative prose, and a hauntingly resonant ending. The theme of sacrifice elevates the narrative beyond its surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, with no clichés or formulaic phrasing. The treatment of emotion (e.g., "faith preserved like pressed flowers") is nuanced, and the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished work where every element serves the story's depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on legacy and belief.</comment>
