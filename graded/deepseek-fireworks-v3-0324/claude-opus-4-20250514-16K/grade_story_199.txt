<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mika's motivation is compelling and deeply tied to her grandmother's legacy; her obsessive maintenance of the orchard reveals both her dedication and latent desperation. However, her "voice" could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's structure is elegant, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and a satisfying arc. The tight word limit is used masterfully, though the climax could linger slightly longer for emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is vividly realized—decaying yet mystical, with sensory details (cracked asphalt, silver leaves) enhancing its dreamlike quality. The setting and timeframe synergize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (notebooks as seeds, trees as nets) and layered themes (obsession vs. wonder) elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the flame/ash metaphor borders on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids tropes; the "familiar unknown" motif and chaotic tone feel fresh. Minor nitpick: "gray static of survival" verges on generic dystopian phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting gem. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader with lingering questions about memory and divinity.</comment>
