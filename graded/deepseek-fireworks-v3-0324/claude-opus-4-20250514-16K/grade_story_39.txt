<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit; the lantern's revelation feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The Martian biodome is vividly realized, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's themes of isolation and deception.</comment>
