<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Margot's motivations are clear and deeply intertwined with her role as a cartographer and leader. Her calculated unpredictability and the weight of her inheritance shape her actions compellingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with pruning as both literal and metaphorical action driving the narrative. The arc from inheritance to succession feels complete despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard's juxtaposition with solar panels creates a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (shifting shadows, weathered fingers) enhance immersion and tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shears as crowns, maps as provocations) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet leaves room for reflection on rebellion and legacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Margot's voice and the world's grit feel authentic. Metaphors (e.g., "handshakes of the Verdant Circle") are inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of resilience and defiance.</comment>
