<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's reluctant savior role and her "normally weird" habit of talking to tools are compelling, but her backstory (e.g., grandfather's influence) feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect. The infiltration sequence is vivid, but the ending's gathering shadows feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cyberpunk alley and frozen escalator create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Quantum-blacksmith tools are a standout fusion of old and new.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "mechanical whale song") and layered subtext about truth vs. illusion. Ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, genre-defying originality. Only minor quibble: "binary hymns" edges toward clich√©. Otherwise, strikingly unique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth without sacrificing cohesion.</comment>
