<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's transformation from corporate lawyer to linguistic preservationist is compelling and well-motivated, though his "trickster" nature could be more vividly demonstrated in his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with cryptic dares driving tension, though the biodome setting feels underutilized as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The biodome is atmospheric but lacks deeper integration with the story's themes; the rain and crops are evocative but passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghostly resolve"), though the rivals' taunts lean slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically rich story that lingers despite its brevity.</comment>
