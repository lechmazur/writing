<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's necromantic abilities and nostalgic connection to the past through her cap are compelling, but her "shared love for old movies" feels slightly underdeveloped as a motivator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc, though the "sound of resolve" concept could be more tightly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered, and bioluminescent energy enhances atmosphere, but "scarcely abundant" quantum crystals could be more deeply explored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh originality with minimal clichés, though "sound of resolve" edges toward abstraction. Nuanced emotion and style elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story. Only the movie-reference method feels slightly imposed.</comment>
