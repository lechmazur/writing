<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael and Vera are vividly portrayed with clear, consistent motivations. Their distinct voices and dynamic relationship deepen the narrative. Kael's desperation and Vera's reluctant empathy are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect progression. The urgency of the Convergence and the risky solution (ghost-song door components) drive momentum without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is immersive, blending interdimensional mechanics with tactile, sensory details (quantum dust, sparking fingers). The shop's broken portals and spectral melodies reinforce the atmosphere of decay and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: haunting metaphors ("death-hymns"), layered subtext (faith vs. engineering), and a resonant ending. Dialogue crackles with character, and the central conflict—stabilizing a dying multiverse—feels epic yet intimate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh turns of phrase ("cynical warmth," "grinding gears wrapped in velvet") and nuanced emotion. The fusion of cosmic stakes and mundane repair-shop grit is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Every element serves the story's depth and momentum. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for contemplation about sacrifice and collaboration.</comment>
