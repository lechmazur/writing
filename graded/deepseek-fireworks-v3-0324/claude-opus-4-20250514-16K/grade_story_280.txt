<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hermit beekeeper's motivation is clear and compelling, with her isolation and work with bees revealing a deep, nuanced character. Her "sweetly confrontational" nature is subtly woven into her actions and reflections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from solitude to preparation for cosmic diplomacy. The tight word limit is used effectively, though the swarm alarm feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with vivid sensory details (quasars, alien pollen) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe ("hush of distant galaxies") merge seamlessly with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (cosmic honey as metaphor, bread-making as ritual), the story evokes contemplation. The theme of solitude vs. connection is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of beekeeping, cosmic strategy, and alien-enhanced honey feels fresh, with no AI-generated flatness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished piece. The elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering sense of wonder about first contact and the "dance" of civilizations.</comment>
