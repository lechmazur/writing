<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus' transition from bartender to crystallographer is compelling and well-motivated. His obsession with receipts and grief-driven discovery feels organic, though his surgical past could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the receipt-doodle revelation serving as a brilliant pivot. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the scalpel's redemption feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's sterile atmosphere contrasts powerfully with the fireworks' exuberance. Sensory details (beer-stained napkins, glowing crystals) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layers of meaning—grief as a collective unconscious, redemption through science. The scalpel's symbolism and the globalized solution elevate this beyond a simple redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "decoded sorrow into salvation"). Avoids clichés, though the "failed surgeon" trope is familiar. Emotional nuance is strong, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The ending lingers, blending personal and universal triumph. Word limit feels deliberately used, not restrictive.</comment>
