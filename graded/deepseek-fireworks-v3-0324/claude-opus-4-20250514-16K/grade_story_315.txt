<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Magdalene's arc from fraud to self-awareness is compelling, with her past as a physicist adding depth. Her motivation is clear, but her "eloquently clumsy" trait feels slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by quantum mechanics, though the temporal loop resolution borders on contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is vivid and enhances the story's scientific mysticism, but sensory details beyond sight/lighting are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich subtext (truth vs. deception, quantum duality) elevates the narrative. The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous, though the "honest con artist" twist feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of quantum physics and spiritualism avoids clich√©s. Some phrases ("quantum foam crackling") edge toward pretension, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements mesh organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about the ethics of comforting lies.</comment>
