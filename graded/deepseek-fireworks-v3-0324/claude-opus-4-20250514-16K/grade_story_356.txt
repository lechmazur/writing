<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's character is richly developed; her isolation, warmth, and temporal obsession are coherent and compelling. Her motivation to escape the "what if" burden is clear and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc from Mara's marking days to her vanishing. Pacing is excellent; the chalk's role and her disappearance feel earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive—rust, dust, and archaic tech create a haunting, lived-in setting. The cargo hold and cosmic clouds enhance the theme of time's weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (chalk, dial tone) and subtext. The ending is poignant, leaving room for reflection. Literary devices elevate the story beyond its brief length.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of emotion (e.g., Vega's concern) and fresh metaphors (time as a braid). No AI-generated artifice detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize perfectly. The story’s brevity feels intentional, with lingering emotional weight. A standout piece.</comment>
