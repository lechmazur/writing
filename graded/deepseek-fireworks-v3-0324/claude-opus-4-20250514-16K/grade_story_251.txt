<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ezra’s ambivalent prophet role is compellingly portrayed, with her motivations and actions deeply rooted in her unique perspective. Her "yes-but-also-no" smile and defiance of algorithmic tyranny reveal a richly layered character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the defragmentation of timelines driving a clear arc. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending’s abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is vivid and immersive, with cosmic scoreboards and quantum foam details enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (marble dust, static) elevate the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A masterclass in literary craft: the story thrives on layered metaphors (cracked marbles as timelines), subversion of tropes, and a hauntingly satisfying ending. The theme of dismantling predestination resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original, with no clichés or AI-generic phrasing. The "happily sad" paradox and defragmentation of reality feel fresh, and the prose style is distinctively nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight. A standout piece.</comment>
