<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mechanic's fusion of human and machine is compelling, though their transformation backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Their motivation is clear, but their 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and impactful within the word limit, with a clear arc from discovery to catharsis. Pacing is strong, though the fountain's origin feels glossed over.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and starriver are exquisitely rendered, merging setting and atmosphere seamlessly. Sensory details (crystalline fruit, starlit waters) heighten the ethereal mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (puzzle pieces as confessions) and layered themes of loss and acknowledgment elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the mechanic's personal truth feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and vivid, avoiding clich√©s. The "exultant grief" tone is fresh, though some phrasing ("repulsively attractive") borders on overwrought. Emotional resonance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The length feels intentional, and the story lingers. Minor quibbles with the mechanic's backstory prevent a perfect score.</comment>
