<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scarecrow's motivation is clear and consistent, his indifference paradoxically passionate, and his voice distinct. The lace fan and oath deepen his characterization effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coherent, with the VR breach and skewering action driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution ties back to the oath seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—fossilized giant and parallel worlds merge evocatively. Sensory details (e.g., "voice like wind through wheat") enhance the desolate, timeless atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the fan, geological metaphors) are masterful. The ending lingers, and the subtext (oaths, emptiness) is profound. Shows far more than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. No clichés; the scarecrow's apathy is nuanced, and the fusion of VR with folklore feels fresh. Language is precise, never purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting question about duty and meaning. A standout piece.</comment>
