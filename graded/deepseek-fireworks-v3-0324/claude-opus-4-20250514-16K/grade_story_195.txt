<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to transformation. The sprint and moon trails method is unusual but logically fits the mystical tone. Pacing is deft for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nomad caravan and desert setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystical realism. Sensory details (dust, moonlit thread) immerse the reader and amplify the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (thread as lost joy) and lyrical prose. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Emotional impact is strong without sentimentality.</comment>
