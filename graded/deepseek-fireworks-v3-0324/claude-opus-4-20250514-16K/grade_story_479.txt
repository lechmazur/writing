<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Morgana's motivation is compelling and clear, blending her glamorous undertaker persona with her mission of digital preservation. Her distinct voice shines through, though a tad more nuance in her patience could deepen her portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and seamless pacing. The ritual's mechanics are inventive, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the emotional weight of Marcus Chen's preservation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details (paint, brass tape) enhancing the fusion of digital and ancestral worlds. The setting and timeframe harmonize beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (measuring tape as time, paint as transformation). The ending resonates, though the "jubilant remorse" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphor of elongating digital souls is fresh, though the "glamorous undertaker" trope skirts predictability. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where elements serve the theme brilliantly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting reflection on memory and legacy.</comment>
