<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zara's character is vividly drawn with clear motivation (protecting kindness in a harsh world), and her actions align with her traits, though her "fervent apathy" could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hatpin's warmth and the marbles creating logical cause-and-effect, though the transition to helping the child feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is richly evoked with sensory details (neon, grimy tiles), and the atmosphere amplifies Zara's struggle against indifference.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hatpin as a compass), emotional resonance, and subtext (kindness as rebellion). The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("digitized its soul"). Avoids clich√©s, though "world on fire" edges toward familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate; every element serves the theme of guarded compassion. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
