<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's tavern-hand background and irreverent attitude are well-integrated into her actions and dialogue, giving her a distinct voice. Her motivation to answer the "calling" feels organic, though her sudden leap into cosmic heroism could use more groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot’s time-reversal mechanics and randomized steps create intrigue, but the rules of the world (e.g., prime footprints, temporal arithmetic) feel overly dense for the word limit. The ending resolves cleanly but some logic gaps linger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden and backward-flowing time are vividly rendered with sensory details (humming shells, bio-engineered plants). The setting amplifies the story’s surreal tone and Mira’s disorientation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (shells as beacons, time hiccupping) and a memorable mix of flippant humor and cosmic stakes. The ending’s thematic punch ("working-class hero") lands well, though some dialogue leans into exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original blend of tavern grit and time paradoxes. The prose avoids clichés, and the tonal balance ("flippant solemnity") feels fresh. Minor quibbles: Dr. Temporal’s explanation borders on infodump.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story’s brevity works in its favor, with elements layered purposefully. The shells and footprints tie into theme and plot elegantly. Leaves a lingering question about free will vs. destiny.</comment>
