<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brother Matthias is vividly rendered with a clear, consistent motivation that beautifully merges his monastic life with meteorology. His "timidly loud" presence and unique method of interpreting storms reveal depth and originality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with Matthias's unorthodox approach driving the narrative toward a revelatory climax. Pacing is excellent for the word count, and the storm's "speech" provides a satisfying resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storm chasing headquarters and the primordial hues of the sky create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "cathedral bells made of rain") elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor and symbolism are masterfully deployed. The ending is profound, suggesting a deeper theme about rediscovering lost connections with nature. The prose is lyrical yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s, offering a strikingly original premise. Matthias's blend of mysticism and science feels fresh, and the emotional resonance is earned, not stated. No AI tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Every element serves the story's thematic depth, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. The "recovered language" motif is unforgettable.</comment>
