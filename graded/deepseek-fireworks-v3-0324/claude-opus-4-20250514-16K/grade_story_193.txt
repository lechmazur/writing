<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong character development; the prince's isolation and healing role are well-integrated, though his "unintentionally iconic" status could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect; the snowstorm encounter and key symbolism are deftly threaded into the narrative arc.</comment>
