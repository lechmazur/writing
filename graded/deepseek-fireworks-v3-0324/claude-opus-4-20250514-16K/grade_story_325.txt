<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's eccentricity and scientific obsession are vividly portrayed, with her plants serving as both tools and foils. Her motivation is clear, but her "comically serious" attribute could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the film reel's hidden frames driving the mystery. Pacing is excellent, though the intermission timeframe slightly limits the climax's urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Himalayan Tea House is atmospheric and deeply integrated with the story's electromagnetic phenomena. Sensory details (glowing leather, ionized air) elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—science vs. mysticism, loyalty vs. betrayal. Literary devices (the belt's symbolism, plants as compasses) are masterful. The ending lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality. Margot's madness feels fresh, and the fusion of botany and electromagnetism avoids cliché. Language is vivid yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive triumph. Every element serves the story’s depth, and the word limit feels deliberate, leaving haunting implications.</comment>
