<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marya's motivation is clear, her defiance and sorrow palpable. Her actions align with her role as a time refugee, but a tad more backstory could deepen her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the star-alignment mechanism feels slightly underdeveloped. The climax and resolution are satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse and temporal boundary create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., luminous moths) elevate the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance and symbolism (tablecloth as memory-map) are exceptional. Ending is poignant and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("borrowed dawn") and nuanced emotion. No clich√©s, though "unstoppable will" borders on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy and hope.</comment>
