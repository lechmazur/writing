<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is nuanced, with Maya's aloofness and David's patient persistence effectively contrasted. Their motivations (solitude vs. connection) are clear but could delve deeper into emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the cracked tile serving as a potent metaphor bridging past and present. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the mall's algorithmic role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Futuristic mall setting is inventive but underutilized; the cracked tile's sensory detail shines, while the mall's shifting layout lacks vivid texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (tile as river, mapping as emotional journey) and subtext. Dialogue is purposeful, though David's exposition about the project feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("river frozen in ceramic"). Minor AI tells in overly precise descriptors ("biodegradable coffee cups"). Emotional resonance is strong but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere elegantly, with kayaking and mapping serving dual thematic roles. The ending lingers, though the mall's predictive algorithms could be more integral.</comment>
