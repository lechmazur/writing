<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and compelling, her "frenetic" energy and role as an illusionist deeply inform her actions. The supporting characters' confessions add richness, though some could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the power outage serving as a catalyst for organic convergence. Pacing is excellent, and the ending leaves a deliberate, haunting open-endedness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted—sensory details (humming wood, impossible zephyr) merge seamlessly with the mystical tone. The setting is integral, not just backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tree rings as time, the labyrinth metaphor). Emotional resonance is high, and the theme of collective memory lingers. Minor deduction for slightly abstract dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("radiant shifts as tears in time"). Avoids clichés, and the prose is vivid without being purple. Only a whisper of predictability in the confessions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the ending invites reflection. Nearly flawless execution.</comment>
