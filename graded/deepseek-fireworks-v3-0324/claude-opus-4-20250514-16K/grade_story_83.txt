<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. Her "suspiciously trusting" nature is a strength, driving her actions believably.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, but the mirror maze’s role could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The abandoned lab and broken mirrors enhance the eerie, mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (seeds, mirrors) and emotional resonance. The ending satisfies, though the dialogue with the shadow being could feel more organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story elegantly. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
