<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's cynical, pragmatic voice and scarred hands subtly convey his history, though his transformation revelation could be more integrated into his established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is tight, with the windmill’s rotation providing a natural time constraint. The memory’s distortion and Marcus’s decision to lie form a coherent arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mushroom house’s bioluminescence and the windmill’s groans create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the story’s themes of decay and distortion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (watches, candleflame) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s resignation to comforting lies lingers unsettlingly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("truth dissolving into what people need to believe") and nuanced emotional ambiguity. No clichés or formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense microcosm. The brevity feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story’s eerie, philosophical core.</comment>
