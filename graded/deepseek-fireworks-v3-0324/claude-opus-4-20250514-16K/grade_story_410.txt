<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's character is vividly portrayed with a distinct voice, blending isolation-fueled sarcasm and hidden longing. His motivation to restore the water systems is clear, though his self-deception about leaving adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bread scent serving as a catalyst for accidental success. Pacing and cause-effect logic are strong, though Marcus's hesitation to leave feels slightly rushed in resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cavern cathedral is breathtakingly rendered, with phosphorescent flora and sensory details (bread smell, water sounds) amplifying atmosphere. Setting and mood are flawlessly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary craft excels—symbolism (scissors/connection), irony, and layered subtext about isolation. The ending resonates, though the hallucinatory bread could be more explicitly tied to theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Marcus's nuanced despairing humor and the moss's "pity" glow stand out. Minor quibble: the elevator's role borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the cost of solitude without heavy-handedness.</comment>
