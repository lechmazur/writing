<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn with clear motivation and subtle rebellion, though some nuances of his 'loyally disloyal' nature could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and compelling, but the resolution of 'escape' feels slightly rushed. Pacing within word limit is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite, with sensory details and atmospheric blending of mundane and magical. A standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and subtext; the spoon as rebellion and time as soft edges elevates the prose to near-flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor quibble: 'frothy despair' borders on overworked imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers in the mind with poetic precision.</comment>
