<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, with his "artfully clumsy" demeanor serving both his surveillance and emotional undercurrents. His backstory with the wooden bead and wedding ring adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the therapy session serving as a clever cover for surveillance. Cause-and-effect is logical, and the pacing balances tension and introspection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned hospital waiting area and funhouse mirror create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, heat signatures) enhance the mood and Marcus's covert actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism (bead, mirror) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers with thematic weight, and the prose is sharp, showing rather than telling emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The juxtaposition of therapy and vigilante justice feels nuanced, and the prose avoids AI-generated stiffness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, and the story leaves a resonant impact about justice and patience.</comment>
