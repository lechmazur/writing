<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is subtly clear—his "purpose disguised as aimlessness" is compelling. His puppetry as a method to heal aligns perfectly with his bardic role, creating a distinct, memorable character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from setup to resolution, with the puppet show driving emotional change. Tight pacing avoids feeling rushed, though the mountain's scale slightly overshadows the bar's intimacy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly atmospheric, merging despair and literary decay. Sensory details (dusty shelves, dim lights) deepen immersion, though liquor’s role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: puppets symbolize unspoken truths, and the dentures’ duality (fake yet transformative) resonates. Theme of reconciliation is layered, and the ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors (e.g., "love allowed to frost over"). Elias’s subversive artistry and the mountain’s conceit defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious; elements serve the story elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on silence and connection.</comment>
