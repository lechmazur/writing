<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her scholarly rebellion, though her reticence could be more consistently shown in her internal dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action logically leading to the next. The only minor flaw is the abrupt transition into the chamber.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered, with sensory details amplifying the atmosphere. The lanterns and echoes elevate the tension brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext about academic arrogance and hidden truths. Literary devices (e.g., echoes as voices across time) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrasing ("pensive mirth") feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of scholarly defiance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with clever use of constraints. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of disrupting complacency.</comment>
