<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Millicent's sheepish yet analytically creative personality is sharply defined and drives her unconventional diplomacy. Her motivation evolves organically from mission to genuine connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven; the lamp and naptime exploit logical gaps in the Center's systems. Cause/effect (e.g., sewage patterns leading to negotiation) is brilliant. Pacing balances absurdity with tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope shadows and humming supercomputers amplify the absurd yet eerie atmosphere. The lamp's glow mirrors Glorthax’s grandmother's eyes—sensory details deepen the bizarre kinship.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite subtext: a spy using analysis for empathy instead of espionage. Dialogue crackles ("lurking with purpose"). Ending reframes monstrosity through vulnerability and sudoku.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh twist on spy/monster tropes. "Analytically creative" voice avoids AI blandness. Emotional beats (e.g., tentacle touching the lamp) feel human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Every element serves the core theme of misunderstood outsiders. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for the reader to imagine Gerald’s sudoku lessons.</comment>
