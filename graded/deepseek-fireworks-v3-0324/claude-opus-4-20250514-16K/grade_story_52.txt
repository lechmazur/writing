<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's hopeful thievery and deeper motivation (sister's sacrifice) are compelling. Her voice is distinct, but some actions (like the duet) feel slightly abrupt for her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed in transitions (e.g., duet emergence). The hourglass metaphor ties beginning to end elegantly, though pacing wobbles mid-story.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—time-worn marketplace and hourglass setting are vividly immersive. Sensory details (sand, singing) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact with layered symbolism (sharpener, sand tears). Ending resonates, but dialogue occasionally leans didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "grinding time into sand") are fresh. Tone shifts slightly but not disruptively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. Length feels intentional, leaving a haunting reflection on devotion and time.</comment>
