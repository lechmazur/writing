<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric's dejection and regret are palpable, driving his motivation to voice the vow. His actions align with his tragic past, but his transformation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the clock's movement and trident prong driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, though the climax's surrealism slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall and drowned realm are vividly rendered, with sensory details (bioluminescence, rusted clock) enhancing the atmosphere. A masterclass in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (trident prong, frozen clock) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but slightly over-reliant on abstract imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "sacred disorder" concept is fresh, though some phrases ("transcendently possible") verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering sense of awe, though the surreal climax may alienate some readers.</comment>
