<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is clear and compelling, though deeper introspection could elevate his "unknowingly familiar" attribute. His actions align well with his quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with clear cause-effect relationships. The greenhouse reveal is organic, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (e.g., "broken shadows," "sunlight pierced the torn roof") create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (glass/stars, fire-flowers/rebirth) and emotional depth. Ending is both satisfying and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("canvas of life"). Avoids clich√©s; only minor stiffness in Aldric's "earnest" portrayal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope and legacy.</comment>
