<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bard's silent struggle and transformation are vividly rendered, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His yearning for preservation feels organic, though his 'gorgeously awkward' attribute could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from preservation to liberation. The voicemail method is inventive, though the mushroom hall's role feels slightly underutilized for the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent fungal setting is exquisite and thematically resonant, enhancing the bard's isolation and the prism's magic. Sensory details (e.g., "dry tongue clicked") deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (prism as memory, cloak as doubt) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending's quiet resolution lingers, though the 'crisp languor' tone occasionally disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The prism/voicemail interplay avoids clich√©, though "cloak of doubt" edges toward formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that transcends its word limit. The mushroom hall and 'dreamless night' slightly lag behind the stronger core themes.</comment>
