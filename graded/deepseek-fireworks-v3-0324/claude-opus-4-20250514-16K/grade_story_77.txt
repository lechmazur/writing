<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's introverted empathy is well-explored and drives her actions, though her "drowsy enthusiasm" could be more distinctly rendered to avoid tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic, though the marionette's sudden revelation of coordinates feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentically strange, though "mountain wisdom" veers close to vague mysticism without deeper grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The brevity feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
