<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara’s obnoxious politeness and scholarly drive are brilliantly consistent, revealing her cunning and desperation to document the unheard. Her distinct voice and paradoxical method drive her actions flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the laundry cycle’s vibrations, with a clear arc from forbidden ritual to triumphant documentation. Pacing is impeccable, and cause-effect logic is airtight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and industrial laundry hum create a surreal yet tactile atmosphere. Sensory details (pulsing walls, trembling box) immerse the reader while amplifying the story’s eerie whimsy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>A masterclass in subtext: her politeness as a weapon, academic rigor clashing with forbidden magic. The ending’s irony (spirit exhaustion vs. her triumph) is both satisfying and darkly humorous.</comment>
