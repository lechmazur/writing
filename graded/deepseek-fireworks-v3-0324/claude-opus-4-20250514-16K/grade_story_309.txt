<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's exhaustion and sarcasm are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "outdance inevitability" feels slightly abstract. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the resolution via kaleidoscope feels abrupt. Cause and effect are clear, but the ending lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gallery and quarantine backdrop are evocative, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere amplifies Marcus's isolation, though the "vanishing" theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the Queen of Hearts as symbolism) are effective, and the subtext of futility is compelling. The ending is poignant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sucker punch wrapped in velvet"). Avoids clich√©s, though the detective trope is familiar. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels intentional. The story lingers but could delve deeper into its themes of inevitability and memory.</comment>
