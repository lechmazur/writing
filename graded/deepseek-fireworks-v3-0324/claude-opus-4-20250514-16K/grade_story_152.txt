<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The juggler's motivation is compelling and her actions are deeply tied to her emotional and cultural mission, though more internal reflection could deepen her "frenzied" nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly from premise to resolution, with tight cause-and-effect logic and expert pacing despite the word limit. The tea-leaf method slightly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding—the void and abandoned summer fuse into a haunting, immersive atmosphere that elevates every action. Sensory details (tea leaves, glowing letter) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (juggling as prayer, libraries as leviathans) and layered themes (memory as resistance) create profound impact. Ending is both conclusive and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice with minimal cliché. Some phrases ("dimensional currents like ghostly leviathans") verge on over-ornamentation, but the emotional core feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A nearly flawless microcosm where every element serves the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache of lost histories.</comment>
