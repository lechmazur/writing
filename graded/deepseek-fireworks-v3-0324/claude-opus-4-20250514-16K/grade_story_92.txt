<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, though his backstory could be more fleshed out. His "carefully careless" demeanor and trembling fingers add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the blood-drive encounter feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is superb—haunting atmosphere, rich sensory details (wilting plants, synchronized heartbeats), and the setting enhances the eerie tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism in the plants, the dogs as guardians). Ending is purposeful and lingers. Subtext about containment and duty is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. Metaphors are fresh (e.g., "liquid mercury" for the dogs). Tone remains consistent and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. Deliberately brief yet deeply layered, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
