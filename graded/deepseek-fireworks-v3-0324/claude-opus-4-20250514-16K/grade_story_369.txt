<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized—his fanaticism, isolation, and buried guilt manifest in precise actions and reactions. His "optimistically bitter" voice is distinct and haunting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with each fragment (letters, string) escalating tension. Pacing is masterful, and the revelation of his past feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is inseparable from the story’s mood—crashing waves, fog, and the beam’s sweep amplify Elias's internal turmoil. Sensory details are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the string as metaphor, the lighthouse as confession. Subtext about spiritual reckoning is layered. The ending lingers with tragic inevitability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("string sang like a confession"). Nuanced emotion and a voice that feels human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, profound vignette. Every element serves the theme of buried truths. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting resonance.</comment>
