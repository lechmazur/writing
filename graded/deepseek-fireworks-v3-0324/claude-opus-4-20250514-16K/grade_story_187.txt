<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stoic wanderer's motivation and voice are distinct, with layered subtext in her "brash tenderness." Her actions align perfectly with archiving as resistance to erasure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is taut and coherent, with clear cause-effect (nightmares→archive→confrontation). Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive—"mesmerizingly bland magic" and the moth familiar create uncanny atmosphere. Sensory details (splinters, chalk dust) anchor the surreal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the floorboard as symbolic archive, dialogue with subtext ("You can't archive what breathes"), and thematic depth about truth/lies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—fresh metaphors (moth with human eyes), no clichés. Nuanced handling of "necessary lies" avoids didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where elements serve theme organically. Lingers on memory and the cost of protection.</comment>
