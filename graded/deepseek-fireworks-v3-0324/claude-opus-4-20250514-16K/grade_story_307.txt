<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luz's spirited yet quietly rebellious nature is vividly portrayed, with clear, consistent motivation that drives her actions and reactions—especially her transformative use of neon messages.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Luz's actions (repairing lights, broadcasting affirmations) driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The fairy light repair shop and post-parade hush create a richly atmospheric setting. Sensory details (neon flickers, confetti) immerse the reader and amplify the story's ethereal grit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (neon as rebellion) and layered subtext. The ending resonates, though the conflict with the "old guard" could be more explicitly threaded earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Remarkably original, with fresh metaphors ("scars are constellations") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés and formulaic prose, offering a distinct, human voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the story feels deliberate and cohesive. Leaves a lingering question: Can gentleness truly dismantle cynicism? A standout.</comment>
