<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness and curiosity are well-established, though her grandmother's connection feels slightly underexplored. Marcus's role is intriguing but could use more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with clear cause-and-effect, though the crane malfunction feels somewhat convenient. The ending is purposeful and resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the wounded October and rust-stained containers enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details like "pages fluttering like trapped moths" are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the logbook as inherited truth) and subtext (the city's buried secrets). The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The grandmother's logbook twist is fresh, and the prose avoids being overly ornate or generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity enhances its impact.</comment>
