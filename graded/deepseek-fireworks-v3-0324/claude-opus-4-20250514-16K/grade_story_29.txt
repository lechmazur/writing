<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's clever naivety and hopeful determination are consistently conveyed, shaping her actions and decisions. However, deeper introspection could elevate her complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the Machine's defeat feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard garden and flickering streetlamp create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing apples, grinding gears) are vividly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (jigsaw edge as reality's fragment) and layered themes (regret as teacher) resonate. The ending is satisfying but could linger longer emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (Machine's "brass teeth") and original worldbuilding avoid clichés. The voice is distinct, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the streetlamp's role feels underutilized. The brevity serves the story’s mythic tone perfectly.</comment>
