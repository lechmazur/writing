<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zara's alien identity and teacher disguise are compelling, but her motivation to "rescue lost knowledge" feels slightly abstract. Her emotional arc (fear → love) is strong, though.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect (organ → tile unlocking). Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the reveal of humanity's cosmic heritage feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The Roman bathhouse-turned-concert hall is masterfully evoked with sensory details (organ reverberations, mosaic textures). Atmosphere and setting amplify the story's themes perfectly.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tile as hidden truth, music as bridge) and emotional resonance. Ending is purposeful, though the theme of "knowledge hoarded in fear" could be sharper.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (music as dimensional penetration). Minor AI tells: "fierce tenderness" is slightly overused. Nuanced handling of Zara's alien emotions stands out.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. The length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic weight. Combines elements ingeniously—music, aliens, and ancient Rome harmonize unexpectedly well.</comment>
