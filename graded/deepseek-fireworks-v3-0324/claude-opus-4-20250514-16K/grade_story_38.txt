<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's motivation is clear and consistent, her actions revealing a calculated, haunted psyche. Her distinct voice and alignment with non-violent retribution are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect relationships (whispers → reputational destruction) logically driving the narrative. Pacing is effective despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway setting are evocatively intertwined, with botanical details amplifying the atmosphere of decay and tension. Sensory immersion is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (botanical specimens as violence metaphors) and subtext. The ending satisfies while leaving thematic resonance. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>
