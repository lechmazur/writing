<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's frailty and wavering resolve are compellingly integrated into his motivation, giving depth to his rebellion. His actions align well with his established traits, though his "resolutely wavering" nature could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the phial's use, but the climax feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the final ceremony could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal island setting is vividly evoked with sensory details (e.g., sour phial smell) and enhances the theme of impermanence. Atmosphere deeply supports the character's struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (paint as fate) and subtext. The ending is poignant and purposeful, with clear thematic resonance ("wash clean"). Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The rebellion feels fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "paint washes away") are specific. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thematically rich story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and thought-provoking.</comment>
