<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and poignant, with his past and present selves effectively contrasted through his reactions to the pen and suitcase. His "voice" is distinct, though some nuances of his transition from symphony to street could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled around the absurdist premise, with logical cause-and-effect despite surreal elements. Pacing is excellent, though the ending's thematic punch slightly outstrips its emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The automated postal facility is vivid and thematically resonant, with mechanical whirring and lost letters creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (rust, musical notations) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (pen as conduit, suitcase as unresolved past) and layered subtext. The ending’s bittersweet acceptance lingers, though the supervisor’s manic energy sometimes overshadows Marcus’s introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and refreshingly unformulaic. The cosmic-absurdity theme avoids cliché, and metaphors (sorting codes as musical notes) feel fresh. Nuanced handling of regret elevates it beyond typical AI-emotion tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the pen and sorting facility feel inevitable, not imposed. The brevity sharpens the story’s impact, leaving a resonant question about missed connections.</comment>
