<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and compelling, her compassion driving her actions consistently. Her "self-taught wizardry" and ethereal form add depth, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and propulsive within the tight word limit, with a clear arc. Pacing is strong, though the resolution leans slightly on cosmic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—sensory details and "elegant chaos" immerse the reader. The archive’s infinite corridors and auroras enhance the emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (quantum weight, kaleidoscopic possibilities) deepen the theme of love defying collapse. Ending is satisfying, though some metaphors border on overripe.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Some phrases ("fiber optic dreams") risk ornamental excess, but the emotional core feels authentic and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, resonant whole. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about memory’s fragility.</comment>
