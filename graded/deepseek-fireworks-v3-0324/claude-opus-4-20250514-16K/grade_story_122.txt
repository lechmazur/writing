<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaine's duality (digital/organic) and motivation (proving refraction as salvation) are vivid and consistent, though his "patiently frantic" state could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, escalating structure with clear cause-effect (server farms burning → EMP threat → prism solution). Pacing balances urgency and revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sky burial setting and storm clash brilliantly with cyber-templar themes. Sensory details (leather, lightning, vultures) immerse without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional symbolism (bridle as anchor, prism as bridge) and thematic depth (illusion of boundaries). Ending resonates beyond the word limit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strikingly original fusion of cyberpunk and Tibetan ritual. No clichés; metaphors ("reality as protocol") feel fresh and earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a seamless whole. Lingering questions about consciousness elevate it beyond technical execution.</comment>
