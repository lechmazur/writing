<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is crystal clear and deeply rooted in her past actions and the necklace's significance. Her "logically emotional" attribute is deftly shown through her calculated risks, blending rationality with compassion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the countdown and overreach driving urgency. The discovery of the garden feels earned, though the resolution with authorities is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and scent-based navigation create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (jasmine, phosphorescent moss) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft—symbolism (necklace as promise), layered themes (survival as collective act), and evocative prose ("false stars"). The ending lingers with quiet triumph.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh and original. The scent-tracking method and "grandiose modesty" tone avoid clichés. Only minor quibble: "mathematics of desperation" borders on over-formal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A standout. Every element serves the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader pondering sacrifice and hope.</comment>
