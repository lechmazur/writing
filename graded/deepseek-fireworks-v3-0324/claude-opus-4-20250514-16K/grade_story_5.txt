<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's guarded nature and apothecary role are well-integrated, revealing depth through her interactions with the amulet and her meticulous work. Her voice is distinct, though her excitement is slightly undercut by the story's brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the vision, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships implied rather than shown. The pacing is efficient, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The power plant setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hum, rusted turbines) enhancing the atmosphere. The juxtaposition of decay and botanical life reinforces the theme beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amulet, seashell) and layered themes (fear transformed into knowledge) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue's absence limits emotional resonance slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in premise and execution. The metaphors (e.g., "hum of humility") are fresh, and the emotional nuance avoids clich√©. No signs of formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly woven; the story feels deliberate rather than constrained. Lingering themes (wisdom in decay) and Mira's quiet determination leave a lasting impression.</comment>
