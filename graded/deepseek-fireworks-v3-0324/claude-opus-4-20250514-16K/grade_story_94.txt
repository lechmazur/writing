<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's temporal logic is cohesive, but the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines resolution. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sky reflection pool and amber earrings create a vivid, atmospheric backdrop. Sensory details (light, water ripples) elevate the mood.</comment>
