<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's dual professions and her grandmother's legacy create a compelling, multidimensional character with clear motivation, though her "patiently impatient" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the button box and mirrors driving coherent cause-and-effect logic. The pacing balances urgency with revelation, though the timeline crossing's mechanics verge on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shattered planetarium-nightclub hybrid is vividly atmospheric, and sensory details (calloused fingers, throbbing bass) immerse the reader. The setting organically amplifies the story's themes of fracture and repair.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the welding/time metaphor, layered subtext about generational burdens, and the haunting ending resonate deeply. Literary devices are deployed with precision and purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "time fracture like safety glass"). Nuanced emotional resonance avoids clich√©, though the "inherited mystery" trope is slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich microcosm. The constraints feel intentional, and the interplay of elements (welding/timelines) lingers provocatively.</comment>
