<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's merchant background informs his detached, transactional view of truth, but deeper emotional layers are hinted at rather than explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful progression with clear cause-and-effect. The butter churn’s role as a catalyst is abrupt but thematically justified.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The word constraint feels deliberate, though Kael’s arc could delve deeper.</comment>
