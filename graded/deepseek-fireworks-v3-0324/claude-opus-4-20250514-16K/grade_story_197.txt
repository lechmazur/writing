<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and compelling, with her con artist background and sinister twist well-integrated. Her voice is distinct, and her transformation feels earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The twist is foreshadowed subtly, and the pacing balances urgency with atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The Worldtree and its eerie, dreamlike horrors are vividly rendered. Sensory details (sticky notes, fabric scrap, bone staircases) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fabric as stolen sanity, lullaby as silence) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, and the prose is precise yet poetic, showing far more than it tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with no clich√©s. The nightmare-as-currency concept and Marlowe's inversion of expectations feel fresh. Language is inventive but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, all serving the story's eerie, mythic weight. The brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant questions about dreams and deception.</comment>
