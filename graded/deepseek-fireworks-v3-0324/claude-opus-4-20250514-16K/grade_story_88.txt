<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from tension to resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the data-miner conflict resolves abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Neo-Uruk's setting is richly evocative, merging ancient and futuristic elements seamlessly. Sensory details (dust motes, chrome reflections) enhance immersion.</comment>
