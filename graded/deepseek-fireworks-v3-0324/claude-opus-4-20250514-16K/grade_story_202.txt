<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's character is vividly drawn, with her "poisonous" gift and guilt creating a compelling internal conflict. The skateboarder's motivation is also clear, though slightly less fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the scavenger hunt and vault confrontation serving as effective narrative drivers. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum setting is immersive and atmospheric, with "dusty starlight" and artifacts adding depth. Sensory details are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (rapier as legacy, skateboard as preparation) and emotional weight elevate this beyond surface plot. The ending is hauntingly unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors (e.g., Marina's gift as "venom"). Avoids clich√©s and showcases a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about choice and inheritance.</comment>
