<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's bitter optimism and heiress background are woven well into her actions, particularly the parking stub as both anchor and artifact. However, more internal depth could elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight yet coherent, with the detour and climax resolving cleanly. Fragmentation as both concept and plot device is handled deftly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The station’s shifting physics and organic-alien hybridity create a visceral, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (vibrations, warmth of the stub) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary craft shines (e.g., "reckless precision" bacteria), though the ending’s triumph slightly undercuts earlier tension. Theme of unification via paradox is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original execution—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("jellyfish through cosmic oceans"). Only minor nitpicks: "bitterly optimistic" edges toward stated emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where all elements serve the narrative. The parking stub’s symbolism lingers brilliantly.</comment>
