<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, her actions reveal a deep, almost obsessive connection to imperfection and stellar phenomena. Her "voice" is distinct, though her dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with sabotage and stellar energy channeling driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect chain is logical. The ending feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rusted cables, cracked porcelain) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The abandoned city and mannequins are meaningfully connected to the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken mannequins as conductors) and subtext (beauty in decay) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the prose is evocative without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose avoids AI-like repetition. The theme of imperfection is fresh and compelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering impression of wonder and destruction.</comment>
