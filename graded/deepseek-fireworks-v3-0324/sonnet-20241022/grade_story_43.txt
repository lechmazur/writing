<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his loneliness and search for his sister driving his actions. His reaction to the CD and the cathedral reveals depth, though his "wary explorer" trait could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the CD and fireflies guiding Marcus logically toward the reunion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the sister's transformation could be foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and fog create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (LED spires, holographic saints) are masterfully used to enhance the mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, with strong symbolism (fireflies as guides, CD as a bridge). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "digital evolution" could be more subtly woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of classical and digital aesthetics is inventive, though some metaphors (e.g., "neon cathedral") risk becoming overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about humanity's post-digital future.</comment>
