<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deputy Chen's stoicism and subtle awe are well-balanced, revealing depth through her fascination with bees and the twist tie. Her motivation to witness grace aligns with her reserved nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s quiet tension builds organically, with the bees' dance and oil change serving as parallel rhythms. The ending feels earned, though slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vividly rendered, with sensory details (light, hum, dripping oil) amplifying the atmosphere. The twist tie’s intrusion is a masterstroke.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bees as messengers, the twist tie as modernity’s scar) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s omission from her report adds thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though the bees’ "secret language" edges toward whimsy. The deputy’s emotional restraint feels authentically human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, luminous vignette. The brevity serves its meditative tone, and the fusion of mundane and mystical lingers.</comment>
