<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his past, with his actions and personality vividly shaped by his circumstances. His "voice" is distinct, blending desperation with nobility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the marbles' decoding driving the action logically. The arc feels complete, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is immersive and richly detailed, with sensory elements (holographic rain, steam vents) enhancing the atmosphere. The market's contrast with Marcus's mission is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hatpin, marbles) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of hidden kindness resonates. The style elevates the narrative.</comment>
