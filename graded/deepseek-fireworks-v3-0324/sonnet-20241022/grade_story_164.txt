<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his ancestry, but his "wistful" nature could be more vividly shown through actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's methodical work and the arcade's cycles creating a natural rhythm. The ending feels purposeful, though slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade and botanical contrast are masterfully rendered, with sensory details (neon, dust motes) enhancing immersion. Only minor room for deeper tonal contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dust patterns as growth spirals) and subtext (nature vs. synthetic) elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the conflict with fellow artisans could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("neon-drenched depths") edge toward clich√©. The dust-mote mapping is brilliantly unique, though.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a resonant question about reclaiming nature in dystopia.</comment>
