<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's self-taught wizardry and compassion are well-integrated, but his backstory feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear, though deeper exploration of his past would strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could linger slightly longer for emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The virtual archive setting is vividly realized, with immersive sensory details. The atmosphere of "elegant chaos" enhances both the action and Marcus's improvisational magic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor and symbolism (aurora patterns as dimensional instability). The ending is satisfying, though the alien chorus could feel slightly abrupt. The theme of untrained magic as a force of care resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "data streams danced like aurora ribbons"). Avoids clich√©s, though the bear's alien voices flirt with whimsy that could clash with the tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers in the mind, particularly the interplay of cosmic and digital realms.</comment>
