<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, blending defiance and reverence. His "polite bandit" persona and eloquent silence add depth, though his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from betrayal to resolution. The quantum chip and harp's distorted notes drive the narrative logically, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "electronic wilderness" and rogue AI harp create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (warped melody, humming processors) enhance the mood and align with Marcus's purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (time, music) and a thought-provoking theme elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue (single line) is minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of quantum computing and music is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while maintaining elegance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering reflection on time's nature.</comment>
