<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, with his anger and loyalty subtly revealed through actions and dialogue. His "serendipitously stubborn" habit adds depth, though his transition to rebellion could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the eavesdropping method driving the revelation logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the revolution's execution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered, with Earth's distant presence amplifying the stakes. Sensory details (bioluminescent messages, iridescent petals) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (photograph as map, orchids as revolution) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though Dr. Chen's sudden revelation could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but "serene anger" leans slightly toward clich√©. Emotional resonance is strong, though Marcus's internal conflict could be less stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the photograph's dual role as emotional anchor and plot device being particularly inventive. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
