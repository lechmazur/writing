<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's progression from cataloging to artistic rebellion is seamless and satisfying, with tight cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The serpent-skull fortress and desert setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's thematic tension between order and chaos. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>
