<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized—his eccentricity, trauma, and redemption arc are compelling. His motivation (freeing his people) is clear and drives his actions, though his "earnestly frivolous" method could be more explicitly tied to his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a satisfying arc. The confetti-coded proposals feel slightly contrived, but the kaleidoscope's role as a narrative device is masterful. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth and lanterns create a haunting, mythic atmosphere. Sensory details (sandstone, fractured light) immerse the reader. The setting is inseparable from the theme of fragmented truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—the kaleidoscope as metaphor, the subtext of joy as a solution, and the poignant ending elevate this. The theme of perception vs. reality is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés; the philosopher-king’s whimsy feels human, not algorithmic. Only minor quibble: "mathematics of happiness" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering wonder about hidden truths.</comment>
