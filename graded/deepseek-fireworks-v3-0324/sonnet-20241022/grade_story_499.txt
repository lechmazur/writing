<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, with his dual role as ghostwriter and manipulator well-developed. His "poetically rational" attribute subtly shapes his actions, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's coded stanzas driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent, and the story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground orchard and bio-luminescent fungi create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (light, sound) enhance the mood and align perfectly with Marcus's clandestine work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (fungi as manipulation) and subtext (hidden agendas). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of control resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The narrative avoids AI-like flaws, maintaining a consistent, nuanced tone. Marcus's emotional complexity feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering question about power and authorship.</comment>
