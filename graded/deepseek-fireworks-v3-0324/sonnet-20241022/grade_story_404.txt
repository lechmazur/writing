<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brother Chen and Madame Wu are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Their dynamic and shared history enrich their actions, though Chen's "lightly unbearable" quality could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to cosmic resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Convergence's mechanics could benefit from slightly more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The repair shop and ethereal planes are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (void-matter residue, humming key) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting actively shapes the story's stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (trust vs. cynicism, boundaries as both barriers and bridges), the story balances literary devices and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying yet open to interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s through fresh metaphors (e.g., "melodies of haunted doorways"). Nuanced emotions and stylistic consistency elevate it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements that feels deliberate and impactful. Leaves the reader pondering the blurred lines between repair and transformation.</comment>
