<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear and consistent, blending analytical prowess with child-like wonder, though her 'nondescript' nature could be more vividly contrasted with her extraordinary abilities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final revelation could feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (petrichor, rain-streaked glass) enhancing the abandoned control tower's eerie resonance. Setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (chalice as truth, rain as decryption). Ending is purposeful and thematically resonant. Literary devices are used deftly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about truth's cost, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
