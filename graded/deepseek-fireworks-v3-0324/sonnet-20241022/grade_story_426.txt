<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Echo's motivation is clear and compelling, blending her past as a prodigy with her present mission. Her "secretive" nature is well-integrated, though her "angrily peaceful" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Echo's actions driving the narrative forward logically. The connection between her training, the ghost train lab, and the encrypted playlists is inventive and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., the rattling teapot, frozen animatronics) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the cracked teapot, ghost train) and subtext (systemic erasure of knowledge). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of preservation is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., musical encoding as healing) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct voice. Only minor nitpicks in phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity works, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
