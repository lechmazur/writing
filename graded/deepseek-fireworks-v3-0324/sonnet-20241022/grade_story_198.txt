<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marigold's motivation is clear and consistent, with her dedication to the platform and grandmother's legacy driving her actions. Her "oddly faithful" attribute is well-integrated, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spinning wheel's markings and sun trails logically driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the parallel dimension reveal could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating island setting and "fragile ferocity" tone are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., "whispers that leaked through") enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The spinning wheel's connection to the platform is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wheel as bridge, sun trails as code) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the grandmother's eternal youth feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "mangle" action and parallel dimension twist are inventive. Minor quibble: "fragile ferocity" could be more consistently embodied in prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. The elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers in the mind with its cyclical sacrifice theme.</comment>
