<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miss Haversham's motivations and personality are vividly drawn, with her "perfectly flawed" system and guarded secret adding depth. Tommy Chen's introduction feels organic, though his development is slightly less nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The transition from mundane to mystical is seamless, and the pacing balances exposition with action effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with the canyon and portals evoking a rich, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "pulsing symbols," "shimmering streams") deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the stolen tag, custard tarts) and subtext (generational duty vs. personal connection). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of "harvesting grace" and the mocking sincerity of the tone stand out as uniquely inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished narrative where every element serves the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
