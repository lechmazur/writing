<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's carefree gambler persona and deep-seated motivation to honor his father's trust are well-developed and consistent. His emotional conflict and growth are subtly revealed through actions and reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The blueprint fragment drives the narrative forward, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop setting and videotapes create a rich atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, hum of lights) enhance immersion, though the "hammered repose" tone feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, and literary devices (e.g., the poker chip as symbolism) are used effectively. Subtext about trust and legacy elevates the narrative.</comment>
