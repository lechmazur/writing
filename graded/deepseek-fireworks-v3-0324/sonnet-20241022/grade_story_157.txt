<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Madam String's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her family legacy, though her "elusiveness" could be more vividly shown beyond her title.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with rain patterns and puppet performances converging elegantly, though the tailgating festival feels slightly underutilized as a narrative device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library and stormy atmosphere are richly evoked, but the "forgotten" aspect of the setting could be more pronounced to deepen the mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the ring, rain) and subtext (storytelling as preservation). The ending resonates with thematic weight, though the "absurd solemnity" tone wobbles briefly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (raindrops as breadcrumbs). Minor quibble: the term "weather-workers" edges toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, though the tailgating timeframe slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
