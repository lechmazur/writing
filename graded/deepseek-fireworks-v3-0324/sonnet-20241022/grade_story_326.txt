<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. Luna's "sweetly fierce" voice adds distinctiveness, though her role could be expanded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the fire's aftermath could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground fairy metropolis is vividly rendered with sensory details (mushroom lanterns, crystalline depths). Atmosphere enhances the theme of transformation and loss.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth, but some symbolism (the fan) feels slightly overexplained. Dialogue is purposeful, though Luna's garbled transmission disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of magic and genetics feels fresh, though the "cosmic possibility" phrasing leans slightly purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice and progress. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
