<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation is compelling, but his initial motivation (stealing the collar) feels slightly underdeveloped compared to his later poetic revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dummy's verses driving Marcus's arc, though the ventriloquist's late reveal could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The engine room's haunting atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (sputtering lights, echoing pipes) amplifying the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the dummy as a catalyst) and subtext (theft vs. self-reinvention). The ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("crucible for change") and nuanced emotion elevate this beyond tropes. The dummy's voice is particularly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about identity.</comment>
