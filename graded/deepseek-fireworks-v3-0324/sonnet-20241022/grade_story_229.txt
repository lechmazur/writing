<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and deeply personal, though her "mildly curious" nature could be more pronounced. Her philosophical absurdity shines in her method.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with rain patterns driving the discovery. The twist about the grandmother's role elevates coherence, though the word limit slightly rushes Marcus's revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ship graveyard and rain create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (brackish water, humming device) enhance the cosmic intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ring box as star chart) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though Marcus's dialogue could feel less abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors ("the universe remembers every raindrop"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "impossible promise" trope is lightly relied upon.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions about memory and love.</comment>
