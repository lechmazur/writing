<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the narrative with emotional weight. His "shifty caretaker" role adds complexity, though his transformation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from desperation to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the circus's mechanics could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in and surreal circus create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (crystallized memories, starlight) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (microscope as both tool and metaphor) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The crystallized circus is a fresh concept, though the "anguished joy" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. Leaves a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
