<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her displacement, with her actions consistently reflecting her defiance and longing. Her distinct voice and nuanced reactions to the tablecloth and lighthouse duties reveal a richly developed character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marina's nightly signaling and star-aligned calculations driving the narrative forward logically. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the "line that never moves" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and shifting timelines create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the tablecloth's shifting threads) are evocative and deeply tied to the world's logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (light as memory, the tablecloth as a map) and subtext (defiance through persistence). The ending lingers with thematic weight, and the prose elevates the story's emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "quantum foam of history"). The handling of displacement feels nuanced, and the style is distinctively poetic without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that serves the story's emotional core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant meditation on memory and loss.</comment>
