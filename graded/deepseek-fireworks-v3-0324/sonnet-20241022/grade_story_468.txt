<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's curiosity and mortician background are well-integrated, driving her actions believably. Her motivation to collect dream journals is clear and consistent, though her transition to the supernatural could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bracelet and vanishing footprints logically leading to the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "golden embers," "ephemeral tracks") enhance the eerie, mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bracelet, dream journals) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "rustle of revelation" could be more explicitly tied to the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases ("loudly serene") verge on overwrought, but the overall voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that lingers. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
