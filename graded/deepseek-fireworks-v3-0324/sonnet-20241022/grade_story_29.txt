<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edmund's hopefulness and clever naivety are well-balanced, driving his actions believably. His motivation is clear, though his "guileless" reputation feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle piece and frequencies elegantly driving the resolution. Pacing is strong, though the orchard's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisite—crystalline fruit, pulsing branches, and the dying streetlamp create a haunting, immersive mood. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (e.g., "frozen tears," "liquid starlight") and subtext. The ending's bittersweet clarity lingers, though the "beautifully broken" line verges on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, but a few phrases ("exquisite pain," "beautiful agony") edge toward purple prose. The Regret Engine concept is fresh and compelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically rich whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection without sacrificing depth.</comment>
