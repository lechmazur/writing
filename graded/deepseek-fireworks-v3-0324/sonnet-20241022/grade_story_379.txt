<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, with his past as a lawyer and current mission to preserve languages adding depth. His "impatiently patient" attribute is subtly but effectively shown through his deliberate actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The cryptic dares drive tension, but their connection to the rivals could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (holographic warnings, climate mist) enhancing the tension. The futuristic farm contrasts beautifully with Marcus's intellectual mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gift tag, stars) and subtext (paths abandoned). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. The theme of linguistic preservation is timely and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The premise—corporate lawyer turned language savior—is inventive. The prose is precise, with only minor over-formality in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering question about the cost of redemption. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
