<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's forgetfulness adds charm but feels slightly overplayed; his urban foraging obsession is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, though the negotiation's resolution feels abrupt. The connection between foraging and the vault is clever.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Parisian atmosphere is vivid, with strong sensory details (limestone, distant orchestra). The vault setting enhances tension but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (fragment as bridge between art/science). Ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("caught between worlds"). Avoids clichés, though forgetfulness trope edges toward gimmick.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, but the science fair feels tangential. Length suits the story’s ambition.</comment>
