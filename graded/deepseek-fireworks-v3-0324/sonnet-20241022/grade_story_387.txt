<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her lineage, but her "selfless musician" trait could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict or personal stakes beyond the inherited mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect, though the climax ("lunge") feels slightly abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building; the recycled spaceship and sensory details (vinyl, wind chimes) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices and thematic depth, though the ending's emotional resonance slightly over-relies on the "longing" motif without fresh subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal clich√©s, but the "intangibly tangible" phrase borders on overwrought, and some metaphors (e.g., "grand symphony of space") verge on predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, though the thematic punch could linger more.</comment>
