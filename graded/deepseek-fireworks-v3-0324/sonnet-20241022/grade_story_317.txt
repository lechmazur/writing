<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit-7's nostalgic yet determined personality is well-developed, with clear motivation rooted in past trauma. Their actions align with their protective nature, though some emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the sabotage subplot could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar setting and dawn timeframe are vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (prismatic refractions, servos whirring) enhancing tension. The facility's eerie beauty contrasts well with the danger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered themes (trust, duty, memory). The understated ending and symbolic telescope polish elevate the narrative. Literary devices are used sparingly but effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of quiet heroism. Creative and thought-provoking.</comment>
