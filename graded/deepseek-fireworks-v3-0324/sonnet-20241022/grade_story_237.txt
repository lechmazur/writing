<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her psychic genealogist role. Her "proudly humble" attribute shines through her dialogue and decisions, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Marina's actions, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the diaries and the treasure map is clever but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The space pirate brig and fading starlight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the dice and the guard's trembling hand enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (dice, diaries) well and evokes emotional resonance, though some metaphors verge on overused. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with minimal clich√©s. The psychic genealogist concept is inventive, though the "grave playfulness" tone occasionally feels uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brief length works, but deeper thematic exploration would elevate it further.</comment>
