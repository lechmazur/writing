<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her grandmother's legacy, but her "aimlessly passionate" attribute could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the transition from discovery to action feels slightly rushed. The geometric arrow pattern is a standout cohesive device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the subterranean colosseum and moonlight create a haunting, immersive contrast with the amusement park's decay. Sensory details (luminescent moss, grated ceiling shadows) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork as key, arrows as catalysts) and a resonant theme of transformation. The ending is satisfying, though the "cautious impulsiveness" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("liquid moonlight") edge toward cliché. The bent fork and paper airplane are fresh, but the archer archetype leans familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The short length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Minor deduct for over-reliance on "grandmother" as a motivator.</comment>
