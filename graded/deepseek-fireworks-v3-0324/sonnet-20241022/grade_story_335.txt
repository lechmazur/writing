<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his mercenary background feels underutilized in shaping his actions beyond initial setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the amber and mural serving as elegant anchors. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the rumor-chain method feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral's decay and artistic transformation are vividly rendered, with sensory details (light, echoes) amplifying the liminal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as preservation, art as bridge) and a hauntingly resonant ending elevate this beyond mere plot. Minor quibble: the artist's prophetic dialogue leans slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "carefully reckless" attribute could be more sharply demonstrated. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally verges on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
