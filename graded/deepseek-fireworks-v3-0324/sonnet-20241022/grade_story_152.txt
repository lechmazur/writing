<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ming's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his skills and history, though his "frenzied" state could be more vividly shown through actions rather than told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Ming's actions logically progressing toward the descent. The connection between the love letter and the void is elegant, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The void and abandoned summer create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (tea leaves, luminous arcs) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tea leaves as constellations, the letter as a map) and layered themes (cultural loss/rebirth) elevate the story. The ending lingers with poetic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The juggler’s unique skill set and the void’s lore feel inventive, though some metaphors edge toward over-elaboration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for resonance.</comment>
