<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's telekinetic abilities and his grandmother's influence are well-integrated into his motivation, though his "strictly casual" demeanor could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the flashback structure slightly disrupts momentum. The chopstick wrapper's significance is compelling but introduced late.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (e.g., the wrapper skittering) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the wrapper as a hidden scroll) and thematic depth ("the price of knowledge"). The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The premise avoids clich√©s, and the emotional resonance feels genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery. The brevity works in its favor, though a touch more clarity would elevate it.</comment>
