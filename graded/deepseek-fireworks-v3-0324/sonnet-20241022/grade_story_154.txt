<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's anxiety-driven levitation and his role as a courier tracking social changes are well-integrated, but his "strongly weak" nature could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Finn's revelation about vulnerability driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the urban legend thread feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient Celtic and futuristic elements is vivid and immersive. Sensory details (ink droplets, quantum bagpipes) enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink pot as a map of stories) and a resonant theme of embracing contradictions elevate the narrative. The ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The techno-Celtic hybrid setting and Finn's unique magic system stand out, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
