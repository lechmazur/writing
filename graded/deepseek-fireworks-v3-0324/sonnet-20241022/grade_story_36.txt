<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized—his calm acceptance of doom contrasts beautifully with his meticulous craftsmanship, revealing depth. The skateboard as a relic of lost innocence is a masterstroke.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s quiet inevitability mirrors Marcus’s prophecy; the train whistle as a ritual trigger is elegant. Pacing is deliberate, though the word limit slightly truncates emotional escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop is immersive, with sensory details (brass, steam, amber light) amplifying the atmosphere. The barn loft’s hush juxtaposes eerily with the ticking apocalypse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (gears as time, skateboard as youth) and subtext (defiance masked as acceptance) resonate. The ending’s muted smile lingers with haunting clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic; no clichés. The "placid ferocity" tone is unique, and Marcus’s mechanical menagerie feels freshly imagined. Language is precise, never purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. Elements serve the story’s theme of quiet rebellion against fate. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
