<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her role as a conduit for the dead, with her actions revealing her growth from passive observer to active defender of diversity. Her distinct voice and reactions to Marcus's spirit add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the chessboard's missing pawns and Marcus's revelation driving the narrative toward a resonant climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the cooking-class backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (stalactites amplifying broadcasts, shadows freezing) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (chessboard, pawns vs. queens) and subtext (silence vs. voice). The ending delivers emotional and thematic payoff, with the "symphony of souls" as a standout metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of radio broadcasts, chess symbolism, and supernatural rebellion feels fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., Mira's trembling hands) avoid AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the chessboard and nightmare collector elevating the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
