<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past, with her actions and reactions revealing a nuanced, bittersweet resilience. Her 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more internal reflection could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the call and subsequent actions driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the demolition crew's abrupt change of heart could use more subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted house and restaurant settings are evocatively contrasted, enhancing the theme. Sensory details (pho's aroma, knife's gleam) are strong, but the amusement park's atmosphere could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (knife as legacy, cooking as healing) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the developer's epiphany feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally authentic, with fresh metaphors ("dine with ghosts"). Avoids clich√©s, though the sister's reconciliation could benefit from more friction to feel less idealized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. Minor tightening of the climax would perfect it.</comment>
