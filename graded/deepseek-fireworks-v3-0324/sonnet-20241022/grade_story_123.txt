<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, blending personal history with a larger purpose. His "gleefully morose" demeanor adds depth, though more internal conflict could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with brewing as a compelling action driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with sensory details (starlight, dust, herbs) creating a vivid atmosphere. The setting enhances both action and theme seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (starlight as magic, decay vs. hope) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but could hint more explicitly at future consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though a few phrases ("bitter and sweet like history") edge toward clich√©. Nuanced handling of nostalgia and renewal stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
