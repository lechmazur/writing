<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lily's coyness and benevolence are well-integrated into her actions and the twist at the end, though her "diabolically benevolent" nature could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the temporal anomaly is cleverly used to drive tension and resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers meaningfully.</comment>
