<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his shift toward humility feels slightly abrupt. His "voice" is distinct and his philosophical delusions are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from deception to partial honesty lacks deeper exploration. The ending ties back neatly to the beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sewer and amphitheater setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (dampness, moonlight) enhancing the eerie, melancholic mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (cup as talisman, stories as code) and subtext (loneliness masked as cosmic philosophy). The ending lingers but could delve deeper into thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clichés. Marcus’ flawed philosophy and the rats’ role feel fresh, though some metaphors edge toward over-familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity works, though a touch more thematic depth would elevate it further.</comment>
