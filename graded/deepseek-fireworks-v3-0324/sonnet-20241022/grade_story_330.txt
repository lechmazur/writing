<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Edmund's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his lost homeland, but his "normally abnormal" state could be more vividly explored to enhance his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the trident prong and portal serving as logical, resonant endpoints. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the clock's role could be slightly more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall and ethereal dancers create a mesmerizing, otherworldly atmosphere. Sensory details (prismatic light, azure glow) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (drowned homeland/stellar seas) and a hauntingly poetic style elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of displacement could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but a few phrases ("cosmic curtain," "stellar seas") edge toward familiarity. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a lingering sense of cosmic yearning.</comment>
