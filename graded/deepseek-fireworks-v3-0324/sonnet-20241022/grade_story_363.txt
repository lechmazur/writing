<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's grief and motivation are vividly portrayed, but his "passionately indifferent" attribute could be more deeply explored to align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the parade's hush and the miners' documentation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (candlelight, muted bell) enhancing the melancholic tone. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the silent bell) and subtext (mining memory vs. ore). The ending resonates, though the "poignant levity" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "passionately indifferent" phrasing risks feeling contrived, but the emotional nuance is otherwise well-handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's theme. Leaves a lingering reflection on loss and preservation.</comment>
