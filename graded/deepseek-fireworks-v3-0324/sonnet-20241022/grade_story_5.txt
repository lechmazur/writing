<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ms. Chen's guarded nature and motivation to preserve ancient wisdom are clear and consistent, but her "theoretically whimsical" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and effective pacing. The rocking chair's motion as a timer is a clever touch.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned power plant setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the eerie yet contemplative mood. Sensory details (hum of turbines, rusted machinery) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of the seashell, subtext about memory's fluidity) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, with a lingering sense of purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of extracting memories from nightmares feels fresh, and the prose avoids AI-like stiffness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
