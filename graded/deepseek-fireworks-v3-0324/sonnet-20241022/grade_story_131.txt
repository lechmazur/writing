<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's emotional detachment and gradual reconnection with her past are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more internal dialogue could deepen her perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the gravitational anomaly serving as a clever metaphor for emotional weightlessness. Pacing is strong, though the lottery ticket reveal could be more integrated earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garage setting and gravitational anomaly create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing stones, humming) are evocative and deepen the mood. Only minor refinement needed in grounding the anomaly's rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stones as resilience) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its word limit, though a touch more subtlety in the message's delivery would perfect it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The stones' glow and gravitational twist feel fresh. Only slight over-reliance on "weightlessness" as a metaphor holds it back from flawless originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply affecting. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering meditation on grief and adaptation.</comment>
