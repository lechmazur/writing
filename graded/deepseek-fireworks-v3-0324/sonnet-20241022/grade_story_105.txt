<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with her outcast status and obsession with Marcus's work driving her actions. Her trembling hands and racing heart show human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the seashell, diaries, and midnight revelation forming a logical chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The flying carpet garage and half-lit corridor create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (swaying tassels, water-stained diaries) enhance the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell as soul vessel, midnight as threshold) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending merges theme and character arc beautifully.</comment>
