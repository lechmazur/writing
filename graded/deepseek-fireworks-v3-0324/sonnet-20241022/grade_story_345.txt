<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Father Michael's internal conflict and past are vividly portrayed, with his lapsed priesthood and unresolved choices driving his actions. His "voice" is distinct, though his confusion could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the labyrinthine orchard serving as a metaphor for his existential crisis. The resolution feels earned, though the transition from jogging to epiphany is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully evoked—giant bean stalks, shifting snow patterns, and "dull radiance" create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's turmoil.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (abacus beads, cathedral-like stalks) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of embracing uncertainty resonates, though the ending leans slightly toward overt exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sacred geometry of uncertainty"). Minor quibble: "phantom rosary beads" borders on cliché, but the rest avoids formulaic traps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on faith and choice.</comment>
