<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's impulsive performer nature is vividly portrayed, driving her actions and decisions. Her motivation to right a historical wrong is clear and consistent, though slightly more depth in her internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Marina's quest to the revelation of the curse's true nature. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect relationships are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and roaring waterfall create a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., sequined costume catching light, stardust) immerse the reader and enhance the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and literary craft. The twist about the curse being a gift is memorable, and the ending is deeply satisfying. Symbolism (music sheet, constellations) enriches the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the subversion of the curse trope. The writing avoids clich√©s, and the metaphors (e.g., music sheet as a "trapped butterfly") are fresh. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with all elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder and artistic legacy, suggesting depth beyond the immediate plot.</comment>
