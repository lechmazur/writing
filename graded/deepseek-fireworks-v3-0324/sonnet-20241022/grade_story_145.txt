<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, anchored by the rosebud and his sister's fate. His actions align with his goal, though his "uncertainly certain" conviction could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the echo test and Empathy Engine driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the hidden worlds concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (dust motes, pipe resonance) are evocative, but "colliding destinies" timeframe is abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact, with potent symbolism (rosebud, Engine) and a satisfying ending. The theme of empathy restoration is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The rosebud's role is fresh, though "fantasy practicality" tone occasionally wavers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering emotional and thematic impression.</comment>
