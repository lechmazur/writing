<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and compelling, with his merchant background and the butter churn adding depth. His actions align with his disillusionment, though his "aloof passion" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ascent through the poster serving as a coherent and symbolic climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the rift could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is vivid and immersive, with the sterile station and organic rebellion contrasting powerfully. Sensory details (metal air, mossy windows) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (butter churn, poster) and subtext to explore themes of rebellion and renewal. The ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "roots extending through compromised systems"). The tone balances detachment and urgency masterfully.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about humanity's relationship with nature.</comment>
