<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's awareness of the simulation's breakdown and his methodical escape plan reveal a compelling, nuanced character. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coin-toss method driving the narrative forward logically. The arc feels complete, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is vividly rendered, with sensory details (music, crumbling pamphlet) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coin tosses as music, simulation as prison) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the theme of artificial vs. real resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The concept of melodies from coin tosses is fresh, and the emotional nuance (e.g., the lullaby hint) feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about reality and freedom.</comment>
