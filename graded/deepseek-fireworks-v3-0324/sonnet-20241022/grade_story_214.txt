<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his grief and curiosity driving his actions. His "trapper" instincts are subtly woven into his investigative approach, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action logically leading to the next. The word limit is used efficiently, achieving a complete arc without feeling rushed. The connection between loss and discovery is elegantly resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating observatory on Titan is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (methane waves, dim light) enhancing the mood. The sea glass and setting are meaningfully connected, grounding the cosmic scale in personal history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and thematic depth, using symbolism (light/darkness) and subtext to explore grief and legacy. The ending is satisfying and thematically rich, with a strong "show, don't tell" approach.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful without being overly ornate. The twist (microscopic black hole) feels inventive, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Creative and deeply human despite its sci-fi trappings.</comment>
