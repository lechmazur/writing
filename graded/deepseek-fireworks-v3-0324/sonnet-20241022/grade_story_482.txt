<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's insomnia and artistic obsession are vividly portrayed, revealing depth and consistency in her motivation to uncover the wizard's truth. Her distinct voice and emotional turmoil are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Marina's scrying and painting driving the narrative toward a resonant resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to dawn feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom forest and suspended workshop create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (light, shadows, creaking wood) deepen the mood and align perfectly with the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hat as a "third eye," painted smiles) and subtext. The ending is poignant and layered, leaving a lasting emotional impact. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The "frolicsome regret" tone and wizard's paradoxical nature avoid clich√©s. Nuanced emotions and fresh metaphors (e.g., "devoured" attention) stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful blend of elements. The story feels deliberate and complete, with lingering thematic weight. Creative execution transcends the word limit.</comment>
