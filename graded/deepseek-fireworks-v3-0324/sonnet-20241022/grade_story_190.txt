<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his transformation from smuggler to empath feels slightly rushed. His "meticulously impulsive" nature is intriguing but could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the drought center and the violin's hiding place strains believability. The ending resolves elegantly, though the setup could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile, clinical atmosphere of the drought center contrasts brilliantly with the emotional weight of Marcus's quest. Sensory details (e.g., the butterfly's pulse, the algorithms' hum) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butterfly, drought maps) and subtext, but the emotional payoff relies heavily on exposition about Marcus's past. The ending is poignant but could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "enthusiastic apathy" tone wobbles occasionally. The story avoids clich√©s, and the violin's hiding place is ingeniously unexpected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the drought center setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>
