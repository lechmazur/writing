<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's absent-mindedness and brewing background are well-integrated, but his transition to the archive feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to possibility. The chance encounter at the train station is a clever pivot, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nature sound archive is vividly rendered, and sensory details (e.g., server hums, brass lion's light) deepen the atmosphere. The setting enhances both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lion knocker, wave patterns) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the AI/brewing fusion could be explored more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blending of brewing and AI is inventive, though the "flicker of compassion" moment leans slightly toward stated emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of assigned elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about loss and revival.</comment>
