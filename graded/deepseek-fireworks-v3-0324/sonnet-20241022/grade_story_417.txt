<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Adelaide and Brother Magnus are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Magnus's playful zealotry and Adelaide's scientific curiosity create a compelling dynamic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The whispered confession drives the arc effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jungle-Victorian parlor setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (monsoon rains, mud-caked boots) enhancing the mood. The contrast between rigidity and wildness is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bottle cap, orchids) and subtext (science vs. salvation). The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper into thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Magnus's "earnest absurdity" feels fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. Leaves a lingering question about embracing paradoxes.</comment>
