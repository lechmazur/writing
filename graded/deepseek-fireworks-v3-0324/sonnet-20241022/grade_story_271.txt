<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and spice-laden atmosphere are richly immersive, enhancing the macabre tone. Sensory details (saffron, dragon's blood, clicking teeth) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (skulls as failed immortality experiments) and subtext (memento mori vs. memento vivere). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>
