<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's deflated yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, with her paradoxical independence and dependence on prophecy adding depth. Her motivation to rewrite history is clear and drives her actions consistently.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the ritual of reconfiguring the rope serving as a compelling through-line. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, balancing pacing and coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is richly atmospheric, blending decay and magic. Sensory details (cotton candy, rust-flecked rings) immerse the reader, enhancing the melancholic glee of the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (perfume bottle, rope) and layered subtext. The ending is purposeful, leaving the reader with a sense of renewal. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>
