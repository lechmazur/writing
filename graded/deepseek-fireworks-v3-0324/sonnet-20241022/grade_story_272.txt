<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed and consistent, with clear motivation tied to his grandfather's legacy. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his "hopefully cynical" attribute could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the reversed trails method driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical. Minor room for sharper transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night timeframe enhance the atmosphere, but sensory details could be richer. The whistle and encrypted messages are meaningfully connected to the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth, with effective symbolism (whistle as compass/key). Ending is satisfying, though dialogue is minimal. Literary devices are used purposefully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of emotion and fresh metaphors. Minor risk of over-polished prose in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering thematic impact—bridging old and new feels both personal and universal.</comment>
