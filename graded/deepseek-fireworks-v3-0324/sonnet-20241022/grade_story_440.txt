<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's motivation is clear and nuanced, balancing duty and fascination. His "lovingly detached" nature is consistent and reveals depth through his actions and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from observation to resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the quantum collage serves as a logical yet imaginative climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center is vividly rendered, blending decay and innovation. Sensory details (glowing threads, artificial stars) enhance the atmosphere and align with Lin's conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sea pottery, mural vs. collage) and layered themes (paradox as poetry) elevate the story. The ending is both satisfying and open to interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of swordplay and quantum art feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful without being ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on duality and creation.</comment>
