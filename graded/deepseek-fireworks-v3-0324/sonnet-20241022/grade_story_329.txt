<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the puzzle piece's role as a driver is effective. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the chess game could be slightly smoother.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the puzzle piece, chess as metaphor) and a resonant ending make this story impactful. The theme of obsession and transcendence is layered and compelling.</comment>
