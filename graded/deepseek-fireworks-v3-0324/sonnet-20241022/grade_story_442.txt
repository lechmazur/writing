<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between preservation and impermanence is compelling, though his "edgy tradesman" persona feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the windmill's demise mirroring Marcus's acceptance of decay. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mushroom dwelling and spore-light create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that elevates the theme. Sensory details are vivid and immersive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, but "comfortingly pessimistic" leans toward clich√©. The fungal setting is brilliantly unconventional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting meditation on memory. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
