<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maria's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her baker's craft with a deeper, inherited purpose. Her "cynically gentle" nature subtly influences her actions, though more dialogue could sharpen her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sourdough's contagion and time machine garage logically driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Shadow Emperor's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The three-moon setting and mystical bakery atmosphere are vividly rendered. Sensory details (e.g., bread scent, shadow whispers) deepen immersion. Only minor refinement could elevate the temporal garage's integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flowers, moons) and a unique premise make this memorable. The ending satisfies, though the theme of memory-as-rebellion could be more explicitly threaded earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "memory-laden bread") and no clich√©s. The blend of baking and time travel feels ingeniously organic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity enhances impact, leaving a lingering question about the nature of collective memory.</comment>
