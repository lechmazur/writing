<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's jovial defiance and reluctant acceptance of his destiny are vividly portrayed, with his transformation revealing depth. His voice is distinct, though his internal conflict could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the time capsule and transformation arc resolving cleanly. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the telescope's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden's sensory richness and magical atmosphere are immersive. The telescope's repurposing as a botanical tool is a standout detail, grounding the whimsy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sword-to-trellis) and thematic resonance. The ending satisfies, but some metaphors verge on predictable (e.g., "voice rustling like leaves").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the garden's magic system, though the "reluctant chosen one" trope is familiar. Language avoids purple prose but occasionally leans generic ("joy in growing things").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the capsule and vow driving the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of cyclical legacy.</comment>
