<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's progression from discovery to revelation is tightly structured, with the loom repair serving as a natural catalyst for both external and internal resolution. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony's sterile futurism contrasts brilliantly with the rustic loom and ballet shoes, creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (recycled air, starlight) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (threads as cosmic navigation) and subtext (chaos/order duality). The ending's quiet impact lingers, and the theme of ancestral wisdom feels profound yet understated.</comment>
