<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Constance's motivation is clear and compelling, blending aristocratic duty with scientific rebellion. Her actions align well with her "empirically rebellious" nature, though her "dazed" state could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the retooling of the garden driving the narrative forward logically. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (chimes, chalk scratches) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements the theme of merging logic and mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (chalk as a bridge between worlds) and subtext (generational secrets). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blending of quantum mechanics and mythology feels inventive, though the "benign ferocity" tone occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
