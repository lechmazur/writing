<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sarah's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her cheerful meddling with growing peculiarity. Her actions reveal depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Sarah's obsession, but the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines resolution. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (moonlight on rusted skates, footprints in sand) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (skates as divining tools, seeds as patterns) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of Sarah's lucid confusion feels nuanced, though some metaphors verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about Sarah's role as a conduit.</comment>
