<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Ming's nocturnal work and chance encounters driving the narrative. The connection between beginning and end is strong, and pacing is well-managed despite the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using metaphor (origami futures) and symbolism (kaleidoscopes as oracles) to evoke thought and emotion. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, and the handling of emotion is nuanced. The story feels uniquely human, not algorithmic.</comment>
