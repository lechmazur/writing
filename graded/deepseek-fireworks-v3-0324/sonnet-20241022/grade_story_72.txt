<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vineyard as lost hope, blood/wine imagery) and a resonant theme of betrayal elevate the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("furiously tranquil") verge on overwrought. The twist feels fresh, not formulaic.</comment>
