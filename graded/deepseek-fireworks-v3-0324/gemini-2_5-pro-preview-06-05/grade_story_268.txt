<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply integrated, his actions and reflections revealing a haunted yet focused character. His 'voice' is distinct and consistent, though slightly more internal monologue could deepen his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with every action driving toward the resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the mirror's distortion serves as a clever metaphor for the protagonist's journey. Minor tightening of the comms unit's relevance could improve coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and funhouse mirror create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, wooden bead) are evocative and purposeful. The "screaming silence" tone elevates the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant. Literary devices are used masterfully, and the conflict is both internal and external, layered and compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The mirror-tracking method is inventive, and emotions are shown, not told. Language is precise and vivid without being ornate. The twist on war's price is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers after reading. Creative combination of elements elevates it beyond a simple vignette.</comment>
