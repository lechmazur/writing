<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is sharply defined with a clear, desperate motivation that aligns with his past and present. His sobriety and card-sharp instincts lend credibility to his method, though his internal voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with urgency driving each beat. The dream fragments serve as clever breadcrumbs, and the pacing balances tension without feeling rushed. The resolution is hinted at but left tantalizingly open.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The island’s oppressive mist and silence are masterfully evoked, enhancing the eerie, high-stakes mood. The ink well and cooling coffee add tactile weight to the atmosphere, grounding the surreal premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., "a ghost observing other ghosts") and layered symbolism (the ink well as void, dreams as maps) elevate the prose. The emotional undercurrent—love, obsession, defiance—resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh turns of phrase ("boisterously quiet," "dealt in the flimsy edges of sleep") defy cliché. The dream-analysis method feels original, though the island’s sentience edges toward familiar Gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that wears its constraints lightly. The elements serve the story’s mystery without crowding it, leaving a lingering ache of longing and peril.</comment>
