<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Finn's transformation and internal conflict are compelling, but his "gracefully awkward" trait feels underutilized in key moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the coded letter and nightmares driving revelations logically, though the ossuary setting's role in the climax is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ossuary restaurant is vividly atmospheric, but its connection to the war-torn future remains tenuous, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (e.g., calluses as foundation) and layered subtext about cyclical violence and healing. The ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original blend of genres with fresh metaphors (e.g., "screaming metal"), though the "harsh tenderness" tone occasionally slips into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are masterfully integrated, leaving a haunting question: Is Finn doomed to relive the war or change its outcome?</comment>
