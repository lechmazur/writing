<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scarecrow's motivation is clear and consistent, shaped by his sworn oath and the forgotten lace fan. His apathy contrasts with his fervent duty, creating a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from intrusion to resolution. Pacing is efficient, and the virtual reality twist adds coherence without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fossilized giant and parallel worlds create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ozone, burnt dust) elevate the setting's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fan, rebar) and subtext (oath as hollow duty) deepen the narrative. The ending's quiet resignation lingers with purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, blending folklore with cybernetic warfare. No clich√©s; metaphors (e.g., "storm of pure data") feel fresh and deliberate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly, with the scarecrow's apathy and the giant's corpse reinforcing the theme of eroded purpose. Length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
