<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's duality is compelling, but his bashfulness is underdeveloped. The executioner-dancer contrast is rich, but his internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The dance-to-gallows transition is abrupt—more connective tissue needed for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating studio and festival atmosphere are vivid, but the "soothing tides" concept feels forced into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (keychain, tides) and subtext, but the fireworks-gallows metaphor is heavy-handed. Ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "benign ferocity" clashes with the tone. Avoids clichés but strains slightly at thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrate well, but the yoga studio feels incidental. The length suits the story’s intimacy, but some beats need refining.</comment>
