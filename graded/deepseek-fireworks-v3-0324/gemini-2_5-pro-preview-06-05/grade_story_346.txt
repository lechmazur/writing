<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's twist—revealing the fabricated reality—is executed with sharp coherence. The pacing is tight, and the cause-effect logic (vanity → revelation → reprogramming) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasp nest's chitinous, resonant atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (husks, hums, pops) amplifying the eerie, artificial tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's blend of high fantasy and existential tech-dystopia is staggeringly original. The ending's void and empty head linger with haunting thematic weight.</comment>
