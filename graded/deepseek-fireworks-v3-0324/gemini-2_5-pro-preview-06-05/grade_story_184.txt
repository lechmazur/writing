<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but slightly undermined by the overly whimsical universe; his "voice" is distinct but occasionally drowned by the absurdity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and propelled by the randomization concept, though the backward-time gimmick feels underutilized for its potential impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, stylish vignette with a haunting aftertaste, though the absurdist elements occasionally overshadow its emotional core.</comment>
