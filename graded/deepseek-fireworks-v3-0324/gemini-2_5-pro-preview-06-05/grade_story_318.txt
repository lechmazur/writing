<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's aloofness and inventor persona are well-integrated, but his halfhearted commitment slightly undercuts his motivation. The spoon's role in revealing his humanity is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from despair to resolve. The lullaby method is unconventional but logically fits the mindscape setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The memory crystal library is brilliantly evoked, with sterile and glowing contrasts. The spoon's warmth against the blight's cold logic enhances the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (spoon as humanity) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, leaving room for both hope and lingering tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its approach, avoiding clich√©s. The lullaby method and memory crystals feel inventive, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. The elements serve the story, not the other way around, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
