<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sheriff Brody's grief and quiet rebellion are deeply felt, with his motivation clear and his actions consistent with his trauma. His distinct voice and method of coping through astronomy poetry reveal a layered character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s tight focus on Brody’s internal struggle and the meteor metaphor creates a coherent arc. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive, though the resolution leans subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library’s contrast with Brody’s rigidity and the suspended midday light amplify the story’s haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (chain’s weight, ink’s shimmer) enrich the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (dirge vs. single note, meteor as grief) and subtext. The ending’s quiet hope lingers, and the style elevates emotional impact without exposition.</comment>
