<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elspeth's motivation is clear and poignant, her "solemnly silly" nature shines through her actions, and her spectral limitations add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect logic driving the action. The word limit is used efficiently, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive vignette. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a lingering warmth despite its brevity.</comment>
