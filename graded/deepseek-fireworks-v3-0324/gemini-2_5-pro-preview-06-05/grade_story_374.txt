<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elian and Lyra are distinct in their obsessions, but their feud feels more like a backdrop than a driving force. Their motivations are clear but somewhat superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but lacks urgency. The cloud-reading conflict is intriguing but doesn’t escalate meaningfully within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The futuristic setting is vivid and immersive, blending sci-fi and pastoral elements effectively. Sensory details like "hay and ozone" are standout strengths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the stamp, the clouds) and subtext, but the emotional payoff is muted. The ending is poignant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, though the feud trope is somewhat tired. The cloud-tracking method feels fresh, but the minstrel motif is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the thematic depth isn’t fully realized. Leaves a lingering question but feels slightly constrained by its brevity.</comment>
