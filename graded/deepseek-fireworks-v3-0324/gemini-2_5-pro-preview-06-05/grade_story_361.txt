<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas' quiet nature and mechanical intuition are well-integrated, but his sudden epiphany could use more setup to feel fully earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot logically connects the diner to the schoolhouse, though the climax feels slightly rushed. The drone's role is clever but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and schoolhouse are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "brink of change" atmosphere is palpable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (die as knowledge, equations as a bridge) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of tradition and futurism, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "hearth of logic and light"). Minimal clich√©s, though some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though Silas' mechanical insight could be foreshadowed more subtly.</comment>
