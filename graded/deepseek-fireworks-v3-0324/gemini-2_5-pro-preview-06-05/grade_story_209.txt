<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas' motivation is deeply layered, with his obsession with mapping railways masking grief. The hairbrush as a symbol of loss is poignant, though his transition from woodsman to cartographer could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect is masterful, with the hospital monitor’s beep triggering the sonar’s failure—a devastating mirror of emotional and technical collapse. Pacing is tight, but the "freed by honesty" resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is hauntingly vivid, merging decay and technology. Sensory details (metallic air, hum of forgotten signals) amplify the atmosphere, though the water tower’s connection to tunnels could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of subtext: the sonar’s scream parallels Silas’ grief. Literary devices (e.g., "despairing cheer") elevate the prose. Ending is raw and resonant, though the "long walk back" metaphor risks cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending tech and grief, but "seasoned woodsman" feels underutilized. Some phrasing ("gnawed at his own soul") edges toward melodrama. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a wrenching whole. The hairbrush and sonar failure are irreplaceable. Word limit feels deliberate, though woodsman identity could integrate more organically.</comment>
