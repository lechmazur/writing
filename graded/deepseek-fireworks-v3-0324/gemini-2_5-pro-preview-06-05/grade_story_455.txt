<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is deeply etched into the narrative, with scars—both physical and emotional—driving his actions. His "intensely relaxed" demeanor contrasts sharply with his inner turmoil, creating a compelling character study.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the shadow-pattern method and the silver peso signal elegantly driving the action. Pacing is deliberate but never sluggish, and the limited word count feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and tactile, from the cold stone well to the faint clink of coins. The "secret agent escape route" setting is understated but potent, elevating tension without exposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich subtext—silver coins as "ghosts laid to rest," scars as debts—lifts the story beyond its spycraft surface. The ending lingers, unresolved yet satisfying in its emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of mundane (wishing-well attendant) and esoteric (shadow sigils). Language avoids cliché, with phrases like "inherited mystery" feeling fresh and precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered vignette where every element serves the whole. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving the reader haunted by Elias's unseen war.</comment>
