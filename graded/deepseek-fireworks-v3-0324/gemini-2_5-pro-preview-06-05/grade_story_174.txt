<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His theoretical creativity and regret are well-integrated into his character, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from regret to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the library's role could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (frost, damp stone) enhancing the mood. The waterfall library and fleeting time are poetic but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (frost, leaves) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and resonant, with strong thematic depth and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The frost/leaf revelation feels fresh, though the "hidden library" trope is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and purposeful. The brevity serves the story, leaving a lingering emotional impact. Creative integration of elements.</comment>
