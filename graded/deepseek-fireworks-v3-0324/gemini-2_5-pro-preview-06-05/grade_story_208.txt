<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's character is richly developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His reactions to the pen and the suitcase reveal depth, though his transition to finding humor feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and effective pacing. The "rewind" device is clever but risks overshadowing the present-moment resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The automated postal facility is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet absurd tone. Sensory details (e.g., conveyor belts, fluorescent glare) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "joyful despair" could be more subtly woven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the word limit slightly constraints thematic depth.</comment>
