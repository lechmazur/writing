<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions perfectly aligned with his desire to restore the past. His earthy authenticity and quiet determination create a distinct, resonant character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause and effect clearly linked. The pacing is deliberate yet immersive, and the confined word limit enhances rather than restricts the narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The aurora-lit setting and the folding timeframe synergize beautifully, amplifying the story’s magical realism. Sensory details (ozone, damp earth) deepen immersion without overwhelming the prose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the metaphor of "breaking chains" is layered, the ending is poignant yet understated, and the theme of legacy resonates beyond the text. Literary devices are wielded with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original. The combination of elements (farmer with a spice scale, starlight shard) avoids cliché, and emotions are shown through action and subtext rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette where every element serves the story. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight and thematic depth.</comment>
