<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation and actions are vividly clear, with his dual desires and method of solving the case deeply integrated into his character. His "rationally impulsive" nature is compellingly shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cold-case mystery driving the narrative logically toward resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax slightly rushes the rival's backstory.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocatively rendered, with the solar-sail roofs and hydroponic gardens contrasting the palace's ancient bones. Sunlight through debris is a haunting, recurring motif that enhances atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling craft—the monologue-as-confession is a masterstroke, blending performance and truth. Themes of illusion, guilt, and earned futures resonate beyond the plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice and premise, avoiding clichés. The doll’s dress twist is fresh, though the "ancient palace reimagined" could feel slightly familiar to speculative fiction readers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale where every element serves the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about performance vs. authenticity.</comment>
