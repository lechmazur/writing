<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "discreetly flagrant" energy feels underdeveloped. His quiet rebellion is intriguing but could use more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a satisfying arc. The ritual's timing and execution are well-paced, though the resolution could be slightly more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and eerie, with strong sensory details (buzzing air, silenced wind chimes). The magnetic anomaly enhances the curse's weight effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (serpent handkerchief, polymerization) and emotional resonance. The ending is subtle but satisfying. Some metaphors could be fresher.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original blend of folk magic and science, though the "generational curse" trope isn't fully subverted. Writing avoids clich√© but occasionally leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, but the cosmic scale motif could be sharper.</comment>
