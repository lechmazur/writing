<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's loneliness and ancestral burden are compelling, but his "ringleader" aspect feels underdeveloped given the ghost story framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled, with the zero-gravity flame dance resolving the conflict inventively. Pacing is sharp, though the booth's reintroduction post-battle slightly jars.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The booth’s soundproofing contrasts brilliantly with the cosmic intrusion. Sensory details (smoke, hum, floating dust) heighten the eerie intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The flame’s ballet as both weapon and art elevates the narrative. Subtext about solitary duty resonates, though the ending’s return to routine slightly dampens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "game of tag" for cosmic threat) and the napkin’s mundanity-as-portal defy cliché. Only minor stiffness in "ancestral wisdom" phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the core tension. The napkin’s stain and flame dance fuse peculiarly well, leaving a haunting aftertaste of unseen battles.</comment>
