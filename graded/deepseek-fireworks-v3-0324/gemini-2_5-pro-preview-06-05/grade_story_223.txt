<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arion's seasickness and naval background are well-integrated into his character, adding depth to his internal conflict. His motivation to confront the mirror is clear and consistent, though his "awkwardly charming" attribute could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. The transformation via the ghost orchid bulb and moon phases is inventive and well-paced, though the centuries-long timeframe could be better justified.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon create a vivid, immersive setting. Sensory details (light refracting, lunar projections) enhance the atmosphere, though the "quiet longing of centuries" could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism and subtext, the story's emotional impact is strong. The ending is satisfying, and the prose is elegant without being overwrought. The theme of self-acceptance is subtly but powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "the mirror before it lies again"). The emotional resonance is nuanced, and the narrative maintains a consistent, distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The elements cohere beautifully, serving the story rather than constraining it. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth and a memorable conclusion.</comment>
