<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miller's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his professional detachment with a private search for grace. His actions reveal depth beyond his "impassive" exterior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from routine to transcendence. Pacing is impeccable, and cause/effect logic (oil change to orchard) feels organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is breathtakingly original. Sensory details (bees' hum, splintering wood) immerse the reader fully. Atmosphere elevates the theme of hidden beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (bees as choir, twist tie as redemption). The ending resonates with quiet power. Theme of grace in decay is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés entirely. The peach rescue is a fresh metaphor for fragile hope. Emotional nuance (his "hitch" in breath) feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for haunting subtext. Lingers like pollen on the reader’s mind.</comment>
