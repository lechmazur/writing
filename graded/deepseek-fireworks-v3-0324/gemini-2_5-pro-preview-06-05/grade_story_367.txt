<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her obsession with precision driving her actions. Her "thoughtfully thoughtless" grace and fervent indifference reveal depth, though her emotional arc feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from obsession to emptiness. The goose's flight as the final variable is a brilliant pivot, though the pacing near the end could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully rendered—the glass observatory and churning ocean create a haunting, sterile atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked bellows, sea spray) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (goose vs. equations) and subtext (perfection vs. wildness) elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the transition to emptiness could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "bruised twilight"). No clichés; the prose is purposeful, with emotional resonance shown through action and setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a poignant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting question about the cost of obsession.</comment>
