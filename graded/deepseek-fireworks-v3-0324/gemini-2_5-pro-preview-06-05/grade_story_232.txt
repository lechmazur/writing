<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Aris's motivation is vividly clear, and his obsession with decoding the inscriptions drives the plot compellingly. His shift from scientific rigor to desperation adds depth, though his "bleary-eyed" trait could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the coffee-ground revelation and dawn scramble creating urgent momentum. The connection between the cutlass and the temple’s secret is elegantly resolved, though the transition to action feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, blending the starkness of the camp with the mysticism of the temple. Sensory details (salt-crusted cutlass, hum of servers) anchor the surreal tone, though the "digital nomad camp" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (coffee grounds as celestial map) and subtext (obsession vs. discovery), the story grips emotionally. The ending’s urgency and ambiguity linger, though the "dire enchantment" tone could be more consistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clichés despite the treasure-hunt premise. The coffee-ground method and cutlass-as-key twist feel fresh, though the "digital nomad" setting clashes slightly with the timeless mystery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-stakes vignette that balances assigned elements deftly. The brief length enhances urgency, but the camp’s modernity feels tangential to the core mystery.</comment>
