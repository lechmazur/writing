<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s selective mutism and ventriloquism are compelling quirks, but his optimism feels slightly underdeveloped. His shift from weather obsession to emotional revelation is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the interdimensional phone calls, which risk feeling contrived. The pacing is tight, but the resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parallel beach and violet sand are vividly rendered, but the diner’s neon sign is underutilized. Atmosphere excels in blending the uncanny with emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "family of two redefined by the ghosts in the machine"). The ending lingers, though the phone-call device borders on gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Pip’s wooden voice and the redefinition of family stand out, but the parallel universe risks overshadowing the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the sci-fi elements slightly overpower the intimate themes. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
