<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias' storm-chaser past and monastic present create a compelling duality. His motivation (carousel restoration) is poignant, though "eagerly unwilling" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tapestry decoding elegantly bridges action and theme. Pacing is tight, though the carousel's symbolic weight feels slightly rushed late.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alpine monastery and desert contrasts are vivid. Soot-stained tongs and ozone-to-pine sensory shifts enrich atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of weaving broken threads into strength is masterful. Ending resonates with quiet power, though "gust front" simile slightly overreaches.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Fresh takes on tropes (storm chaser as contemplative, carousel as psychological anchor). No clichés; "nostalgic innovation" feels genuinely original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere flawlessly. Short length serves the epiphany’s intensity. Lingers in the mind like the tapestry’s "whispers of resilience."</comment>
