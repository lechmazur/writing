<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clear and chillingly consistent with her pleasant yet manipulative demeanor. The juxtaposition of her nurturing facade and psychic manipulation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, though the psychic method feels slightly abrupt in execution. Cause-and-effect is clear, but the pacing could breathe more in key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hush create a hauntingly sterile yet mystical atmosphere. The beach projection is a standout sensory detail, deepening the surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich subtext and vivid symbolism (e.g., collapsing orbit as a celestial key) elevate the story. The ending lingers with quiet menace, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés, but the "lucid confusion" tone wobbles between dreamlike and incoherent. Original overall, though the beach footprints could feel less abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the skyscraper setting feels underutilized. The brevity suits the eerie intimacy, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
