<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "coy spy" trait feels underutilized. The loose button detail adds subtle depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-effect, though the time-reversal method risks slight incoherence. Pacing is excellent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the brewery and spellcraft evoking a potent sense of place. Ozone/regret scent is standout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the time-reversal mechanic and Morwen’s characterization. Language avoids cliché but occasionally over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize well, though the spy premise feels slightly detached from the core conflict. Lingers provocatively.</comment>
