<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thaddeus's unhinged zealotry is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in his desperate need for divine insight. His breakdown at the end reveals a nuanced shift from performative faith to raw vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the uprooting action serving as a catalyst for the climactic confession. Pacing is excellent, though the transition from studying to storming the veranda could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor consumed by the jungle is masterfully rendered, with oppressive humidity and chittering canopy amplifying Thaddeus's unraveling. Sensory details (wet roots, metallic scent) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottle cap as false idol, orchid as "beautiful lie") and subtext (faith as performance) elevate the narrative. The ending’s ambiguity—silence as both judgment and absolution—is haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("the Verdant Cacophony"). Avoids clichés, with emotional nuance in Thaddeus’s confession. Language is ornate but purposeful, never purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the nature of divinity and doubt.</comment>
