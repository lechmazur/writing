<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation that aligns with his con artist nature. His distinct "voice" and method reveal depth, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's action, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the escalation. Cause-and-effect is logical, though the ending feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with sensory-rich details and a haunting atmosphere. The Tree and "pristine chaos" enhance both setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices and layered subtext elevate the story. The thematic exploration of fear and serenity is profound, though the resolution could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI pitfalls, though a few phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a resonant question about the cost of stolen peace.</comment>
