<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's background as an orchardist lends depth to their vigilant nature, and their motivation (revenge for personal tragedy) is clear and compelling. However, the transition from orchardist to conspiracy unraveler could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. The revelation of the peacock-tail encryption is both surprising and satisfying, though the setup could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile hangar setting contrasts brilliantly with the organic peacock metaphor. Sensory details (e.g., the shimmering polymer wings) enhance the atmosphere, grounding the high-concept conspiracy in palpable tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in impact, blending literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) with sharp dialogue and a sardonic voice. The ending is purposeful, leaving the reader with a sense of cathartic vengeance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (peacock tail as encryption) and minimal clichés. The protagonist’s voice is distinct, and the emotional nuance avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where every element serves the story’s momentum. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering question of justice lingers effectively.</comment>
