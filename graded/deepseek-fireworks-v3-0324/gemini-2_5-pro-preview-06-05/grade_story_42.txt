<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's guilt and redemption are clear, his motivation consistent, and his actions revealing depth. His "voice" is distinct in his rough whisper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight, driven by the skirmish and resolved through shared purpose. Pacing is excellent, with no wasted words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The temple and turbines create a vivid, hypnotic atmosphere. Sensory details (scrape of boots, chirping finch) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (penance, barriers), layered symbolism (pen, ink), and a resonant ending. The clockwork finch is a standout literary device.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "coaxed ghosts of ink"), nuanced emotion, and a unique blend of steampunk and introspection. No clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story, leaving a haunting sense of fragile hope. The length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
