<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the glade's musical ecosystem, though "shouting silence" risks clich√©. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors outweigh minor formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, lingering whole. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on creativity and listening.</comment>
