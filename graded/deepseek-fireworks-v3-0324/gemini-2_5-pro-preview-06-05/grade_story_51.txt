<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with his penitent pursuit of resilience revealing depth. His actions align well with his desire for change, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from obsession to realization. The method of staging meetings feels slightly contrived but serves the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension and thematic weight. Sensory details (humming air, rough crate slat) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crate slat, garden) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original handling of resilience and redemption. Avoids clich√©s, but a few phrases ("quietly intense") border on generic. Emotional nuance is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about transformation. Length feels purposeful.</comment>
