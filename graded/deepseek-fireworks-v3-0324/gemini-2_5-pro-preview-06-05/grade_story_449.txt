<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's awkwardness and motivation are vividly portrayed, aligning seamlessly with her actions and the cosmic setting. Her distinct voice and reaction to the storm vial reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with the nebula's "baking" mirroring Elara's philosophical creation. The fusion of tickets as climax is logical and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—sensory details (ozone, petrichor) and the observation deck's time dilation amplify the story's haunting delight and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (gravity as loneliness, entropy as exhale) and a resonant ending elevate this beyond mere plot. Theme of cosmic duality is masterfully shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. No tropes or clichés; the storm-in-a-bottle and concert tickets are fresh, nuanced tools. Prose is vivid yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on creation/destruction. Flawless cohesion.</comment>
