<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her outcast status, but her "strangely trustworthy" attribute feels underutilized beyond a single mention.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the diaries' discovery feels abrupt, and the climax (the jolt) lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and evocative, with sensory details like "ozone and old wool" enhancing the magical realism. The seashell and setting mesh perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolic use of light/darkness, but the emotional resolution ("profound peace") is somewhat told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original premise and fresh metaphors ("soul was a sunrise"), though Morwen's smile verges on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, but the flying carpet garage feels slightly tacked-on.</comment>
