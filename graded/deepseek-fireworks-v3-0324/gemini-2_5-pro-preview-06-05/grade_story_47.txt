<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's "eagerly jaded" state is vividly portrayed, and her shift from resentment to rediscovery of curiosity is both clear and compelling. Her motivation aligns perfectly with her dutiful yet weary character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each clue advancing the mystery logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theater's "soundless sanctuary" is richly atmospheric, and sensory details (dust, muffled auditions) deepen the mood. The setting amplifies both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (glove, locket) and subtext. The ending’s emotional resonance is profound, and the theme of reframing memory lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story leaves a haunting, resonant impression.</comment>
