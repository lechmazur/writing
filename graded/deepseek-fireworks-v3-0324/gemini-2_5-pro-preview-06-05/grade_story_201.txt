<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's impulsive and whimsical nature is well-integrated, driving her actions and reactions believably. Her motivation to right a historical wrong is clear and compelling, though some nuance in her emotional range could deepen her portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect logic. The action of tackling the guardian is decisive and aligns with Lyra's performer instincts. Pacing is excellent, with no wasted words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and tension. Sensory details (sound of water, damp flagstones) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story evokes strong emotional resonance, particularly in Lyra's inherited fury. Literary devices (celestial imagery, symbolism of crumbling deception) are used skillfully, though the ending's thematic punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and minimal clich√©s. However, some phrasing borders on overly ornate ("restless harmony"), and the guardian's sudden appearance lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of justice reclaimed.</comment>
