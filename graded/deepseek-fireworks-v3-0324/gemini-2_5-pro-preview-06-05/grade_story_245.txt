<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and drives his actions with a raw, self-destructive energy. His "voice" is distinct, blending bitterness and reluctant hope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from despair to tentative hope. Pacing is excellent, balancing action and introspection without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rust-colored dust, skeletal starships) amplifying the desolation that mirrors Kael's inner state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and layered, with potent symbolism (tea leaves, chopstick) and a结尾 that lingers. The conflict between logic and longing is masterfully shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Refreshingly original, avoiding clichés. The tea-leaf method and "heart's revolt" concept feel fresh, and the emotional nuance avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for haunting ambiguity.</comment>
