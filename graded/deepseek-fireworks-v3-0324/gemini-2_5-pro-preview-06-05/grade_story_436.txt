<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's sorrow and desperation are palpable, his motivation to reconnect with his mother deeply human and consistent. His scars and rough refinement add layers to his character, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the urgency of the final minute feels slightly rushed. The bifurcation of incense is a clever, coherent climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exiled fortress and scorched deserts create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (geode dust, honeyed tea) enrich the world, though the floating aspect could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (plastic spoon, dream catchers) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant and layered, though the Oracle's silence might benefit from a subtler hint of response.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., dream catchers as syllables). No clich√©s; the painful joy tone is nuanced. Minor quibble: "roughly refined" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the library's closure could be more thematically tied to exile.</comment>
