<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and compelling, blending professional detachment with personal obsession. His "indifferent enthusiasm" voice is distinct, though slightly underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly coherent with a clear arc. The receipt as a physical link and moth sigil as a key are elegant touches. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive—abandoned mess hall and transient clubs evoke decay and yearning. "Quietly loud" silence and sensory details (e.g., hand-drawn moth) deepen mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Impactful storytelling with layered themes (digital vs. physical presence, authenticity). The ending's shift from deletion to story is resonant. Subtext about communal searching elevates it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original voice avoids tropes. "Social media exorcist" is fresh, and the moth sigil subverts cliché. Emotion is shown through action (e.g., clutching the receipt).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. Length feels deliberate; the story lingers. Combines cyber-noir and urban mysticism with innovation.</comment>
