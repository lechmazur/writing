<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's streetwise background and motivation to "harvest hope" are clear and consistent, driving her actions with a distinct voice. Her cunning feels authentic, though her emotional depth could be slightly richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect (reversed steps solving the puzzle) and a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "unwritten calendar" concept could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with luminous fruit and pulsing light enhancing the eerie mood. Sensory details (cold brooch, sigh of release) are expertly deployed to deepen the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (seed as captured dawn) and subtext (hope vs. curse) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful and resonant, with strong "show, don’t tell" craftsmanship throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original twists (reversed patterns, obsidian fruit) avoid clichés. Prose is purposeful, though "theoretically random" feels slightly forced. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving lingering questions (the seed’s future). A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
