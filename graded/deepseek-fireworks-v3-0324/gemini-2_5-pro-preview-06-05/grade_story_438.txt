<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and richly layered, blending scientific rigor with poetic mysticism. Their actions are consistently driven by a desire to reclaim lost histories, and their "discreetly flamboyant" demeanor adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from curiosity to defiance. The override action serves as a climactic pivot, though the resolution could be slightly more fleshed out given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is vividly rendered, its sterility contrasting beautifully with Kael’s vibrant mission. The compass and polaroids anchor the atmosphere, merging cold science with warm nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (compass, polaroids) and subtext (history as a frontier). The ending lingers, posing philosophical questions about identity and legacy. The prose is lush but purposeful.</comment>
