<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's desperation and determination are vividly conveyed, with her motivation to cure her sister's illness driving her actions. The stamp collection as a focus for her belief adds depth to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the physicist's theory leading logically to Elara's experiment. The climax—her momentary shift in reality—is both surprising and earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The undersea setting is richly immersive, with sensory details (salt, ozone, bioluminescence) enhancing the atmosphere. The greenhouse serves as a perfect contrast to the "dissonant calm" of her struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative use of symbolism (the *Echinacea* stamp, the sprout) and subtext (reality as negotiable). The ending is satisfying yet open, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The blend of quantum theory, stamps, and undersea decay feels genuinely inventive, with nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the stamp collection and quantum weaving feeling essential. The brevity serves the story’s intensity.</comment>
