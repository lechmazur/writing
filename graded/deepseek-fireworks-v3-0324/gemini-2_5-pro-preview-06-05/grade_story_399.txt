<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's grumpy, introspective nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to confront inner turmoil is both clear and agonizingly private. His actions and reactions reveal a deeply wounded yet defiant character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the sand mandala serving as a symbolic and logical focal point for his emotional resolution. Pacing is deliberate but effective, and the story achieves a clear arc within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch’s scrying room is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (moon-herbs, starlight) enhancing mood. The setting and timeframe align seamlessly with the character's internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (trauma as grains of sand) and symbolism. The ending is profound without being overt, and the prose elevates the emotional weight without overstating it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and handling of trauma. Avoids clichés, with fresh, specific imagery (e.g., "shard of obsidian"). Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brief length feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic resonance. A standout piece.</comment>
