<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's underachiever status and motivation to confront mediocrity are clear and compelling, though his transformation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with a satisfying arc. The misdelivered packages could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and immersive, blending sci-fi and magic seamlessly. The "bored excitement" tone is sustained but slightly overshadows deeper tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll head, Astromancers) and evocative prose. Ending is resonant but the theme could be delved into more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "exceptionally usual" object feels underutilized. Avoids clich√©s but leans heavily on tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though some elements (farmland sale) feel more decorative than integral. Leaves a lingering question of legacy.</comment>
