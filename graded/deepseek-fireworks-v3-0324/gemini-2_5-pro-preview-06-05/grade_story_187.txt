<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, though his stoicism borders on underdeveloped. His desperation and connection to his sister add emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc. The lie-to-truth pivot is effective, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (chalk dust, damp earth) and the "mesmerizingly bland" setting amplify tension and mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong subtext and symbolism (floorboard, sigils). Dialogue is sharp, but the ending’s "lesson once" line feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "psychic breadcrumbs"). Some phrasing ("brash tenderness") edges toward forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling. The length feels deliberate, though the witch’s backstory could be richer.</comment>
