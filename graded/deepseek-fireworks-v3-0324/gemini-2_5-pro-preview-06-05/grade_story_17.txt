<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and motivation are vividly portrayed, aligning perfectly with his actions. His "voice" and method (eulogy analysis) reveal depth, though his epiphany could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-effect logic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The witch’s chamber and morning walks create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (burnt sage, ink-dark water) are masterfully deployed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of secrets.</comment>
