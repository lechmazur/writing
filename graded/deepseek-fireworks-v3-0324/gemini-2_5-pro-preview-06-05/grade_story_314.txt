<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, anchored by his grandmother’s influence. His transformation from enforcer to guide is compelling and well-executed, though his internal conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc from resentment to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the supernatural encounter’s resolution could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kelp forest and sterile station create a vivid, immersive contrast. The bread box and plasteel viewport are masterfully used to reinforce theme and character. Sensory details (e.g., "hot and real" tears) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bread box, drumming) and emotional resonance. The ending is powerful and thematically rich, though the "laughing tears" moment risks slight melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("forbidden coal"). Avoids clichés, but the "sterile perfection" trope is borderline. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers. Only minor tightening of supernatural logic could improve cohesion.</comment>
