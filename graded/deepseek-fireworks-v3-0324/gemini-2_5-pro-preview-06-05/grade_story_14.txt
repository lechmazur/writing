<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' naivety and desperation are clear and drive his actions; Hemlock's frayed genius is vivid and compelling. Motivations align well, though Elias' arc could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to climax. Pacing is excellent, and cause-effect logic is strong, though the ending's abruptness slightly jars.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal station and candlelit dinners create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ocean roar, candlelight) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (candle vs. sea), emotional resonance, and layered subtext elevate this. The ending is poignant and thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, and the tone remains consistent. Hemlock's lectures feel uniquely unhinged.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful microcosm. The brevity serves the story, and the elements intertwine seamlessly. Lingers in the mind.</comment>
