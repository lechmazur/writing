<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The detective's weary, sardonic voice and intuitive yet conflicted approach to the case are compelling, though a touch more backstory could deepen motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight, efficient structure with a clear arc; the kaleidoscope revelation drives the plot forward organically. Minor pacing quibble near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—sterile gallery and fractured light mirror the story's themes. Sensory details (dust, brass, bloodstains) immerse flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (kaleidoscope as memory, Joker as defiance). Ending resonates with subtext about art and futility. Writing elevates every element.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("dance partner in a waltz against heat-death"), zero clichés. Tone and style feel uniquely honed, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about beauty in brokenness.</comment>
