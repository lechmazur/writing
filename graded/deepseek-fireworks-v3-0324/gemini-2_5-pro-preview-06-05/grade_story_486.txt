<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "clumsily dexterous" trait feels underutilized. His actions align well with his silent retribution goal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The stained glass fragment and cauldron room are cleverly integrated, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard" create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are sparing but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stained glass as a filter) and subtext (silence as punishment). The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of sound engineering as magic is inventive, though the "practical illusion" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, though a touch more character nuance would elevate it further.</comment>
