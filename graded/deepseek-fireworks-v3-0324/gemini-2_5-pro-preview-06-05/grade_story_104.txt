<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is compellingly drawn, his stoicism clashing with his secret rebellion. His motivation to defy conformity is clear, though his backstory is hinted at rather than explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the encrypted package and cameo serving as a catalyst. Pacing is deliberate, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The miniature world is vividly realized, its artificial perfection contrasting with Elias's inner turmoil. Sensory details (cool bone, tarnished silver) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship. Symbolism (the skull as rebellion) resonates, and the ending lingers. Subtext about hidden dissent elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and hauntingly authentic. No clich√©s; the bird skull is a fresh symbol. Nuanced handling of emotion (e.g., trembling hands) avoids AI telltales.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Elements serve the story organically. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on hypocrisy and resistance.</comment>
