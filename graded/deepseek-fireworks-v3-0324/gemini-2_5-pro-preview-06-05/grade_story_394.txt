<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and compelling, though the "moonlit archer" title feels slightly underutilized. The interplay between cautious impulsiveness and her quest for the Echo is nuanced and effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the sequence of actions logically leading to the climax. The paper airplane's descent and the leaf-fork method are inventive and well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details (e.g., "blood-darkened dust," "silent scream"). The subterranean colosseum and amusement park contrast brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship; layered symbolism (fork as lens, leaves as cipher) and a resonant ending. The theme of empathy as a burden lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The bent fork and leaf pattern are fresh, and the prose avoids being overly ornate while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking microcosm. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
