<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The word limit is used efficiently, and the story achieves a satisfying arc. Pacing is well-managed, though the ending could feel slightly abrupt to some.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and evocative, with sensory details that enhance mood. The bicycle-powered carnival and faded orchard sign create a strong atmosphere that supports Elias's quest. The blank luggage tag is integrated meaningfully.</comment>
