<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vividly clear and deeply personal, driving the narrative with emotional weight. The "deserted alchemist" voice is distinct and haunting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from longing to resolution. The alchemical process and pond ritual flow logically, though the brevity slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (steam, damp earth) enriching the hidden park's melancholy magic. Setting and tone harmonize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship. Symbolism (ribbon as memory), layered subtext, and a resonant ending elevate this beyond the surface. Language is lyrical but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original. No clich√©s; the alchemy-memory fusion feels fresh. Nuanced handling of grief and the "intuitive" method defy predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A nearly flawless microcosm. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache of bittersweet triumph.</comment>
