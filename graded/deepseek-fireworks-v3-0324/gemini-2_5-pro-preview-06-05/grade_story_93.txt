<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her identity as a labyrinth architect. Her crisis and subsequent actions reveal a nuanced, introspective character. However, her "voice" could be sharper in such a tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with the radio signal twist elevating it beyond a simple escape narrative. Pacing is exceptional for the length, though the elevator farewell feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The archive's holographic imagery and pirate radio static create a richly immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "silver wound in her eyes") are masterfully deployed to amplify mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (labyrinths as connection, radio waves as geometry) is layered and evocative. The ending’s shift from maze-building to signal-following is a brilliant thematic pivot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of sacred geometry and rogue transmissions, though "practically rare" leans slightly toward contrivance. Emotional nuance in Elara’s hesitation feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a story that feels expansive despite its brevity. The lacquered box and Cartographer’s signal linger as resonant, purposeful details.</comment>
