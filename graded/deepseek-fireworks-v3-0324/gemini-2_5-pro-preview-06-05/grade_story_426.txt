<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply interwoven with her actions, though her "secretive pathfinder" trait could be more explicitly developed beyond her isolation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the marathon training and hacking method driving the narrative logically toward the emotional climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vivid and immersive, amplifying the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., ghost-shaped bulbs, damp earth) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered themes (systemic neglect, human connection). The ending's emotional impact is profound, and the prose is rich with subtext and symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The playlist-hacking method and Elara's "angrily peaceful" state feel fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotion and style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically resonant story where every element serves a purpose. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
