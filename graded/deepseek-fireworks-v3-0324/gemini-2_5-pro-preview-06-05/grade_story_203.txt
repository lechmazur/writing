<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and drives the story. His fear and defiance are compellingly juxtaposed, though his stage fright feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc. The ritual's logic is slightly abrupt, but the cause-effect chain holds. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris and cold vacuum contrast hauntingly with the wildflowers' Earthly memory. Sensory details (shivering water, static whisper) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wildflowers as lie, water as truth) and subtext about generational trauma. The ending is resonant, though the key sound feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The "defiant hush" and "sculpt possibility" phrasing is distinctive. Emotions are shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Creative and layered.</comment>
