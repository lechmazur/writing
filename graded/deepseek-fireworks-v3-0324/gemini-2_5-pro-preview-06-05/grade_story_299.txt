<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with clear motivation and internal conflict. His "unsure champion" role and rationally rebellious spirit are well-integrated, though his doubts could be more dynamically explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the method ("interconnected paths") could be more explicitly shown in action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chalk cliff setting and "cheerful gloom" tone are masterfully evoked with sensory details. The amber brooch and colony are deeply connected to the atmosphere and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, symbolism, and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the writing style enhances the thematic depth. Minor nit: some metaphors border on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors stand out, though a few phrases ("cheerful gloom") verge on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering sense of flawed beauty and resilience.</comment>
