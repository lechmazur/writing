<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and personality are vividly clear, and her transformation is subtly executed. Her "morbid pragmatism" and floral background enrich her engagement with the trunk’s philosophy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from rigid belief to complex acceptance. The lantern-to-candle transition and reading sequence are elegantly paced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo and star-dusted abyss create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (guttering lantern, candle wax) deepen the mood without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft: the spiral metaphor for reincarnation and the candle’s defiance against the void are standout moments. The ending resonates with quiet profundity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic. The "messy spiral" philosophy feels fresh, and Elara’s voice avoids tropes. Only minor deductions for "fertile silence," which skirts cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering meditation on impermanence. Feels deliberate, not limited.</comment>
