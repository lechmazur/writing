<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is clear and deeply tied to his wild, artistic spirit, but Elara and Lyra feel underdeveloped. His actions align well with his desire to transcend confinement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the transition from Lyra’s schooling to Kael forging the flag could be smoother. The ending is impactful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile, oppressive atmosphere of the ozone station is vividly rendered and enhances the story’s themes. Sensory details like the hum of recyclers and the flag’s fragility stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story’s symbolism (flag as freedom, forge as defiance) is strong, and the writing style is evocative. However, the emotional impact could be deeper with more nuanced character interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "audacious meekness" tone is intriguing, though the paddleboarding detail feels slightly forced. The prose is purposeful and vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story’s theme. The length feels deliberate, though some moments (like paddleboarding) could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
