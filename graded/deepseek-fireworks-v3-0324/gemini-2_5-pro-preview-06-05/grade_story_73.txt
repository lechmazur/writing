<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Xochitl's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her role as a custodian of balance. Her 'voice' is distinct, though some nuance could deepen her characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of ancient and futuristic elements creates a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., humming energy, aching teeth) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (e.g., "raucous silence") and subtext enrich the narrative. The ending feels purposeful, though the central conflict could be more explicitly framed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("kindrelize") and no clich√©s. The tone is consistent, and the prose avoids excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
