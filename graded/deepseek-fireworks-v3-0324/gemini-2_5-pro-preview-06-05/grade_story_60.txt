<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's indifferent demeanor and clear, consistent motivation ("binding need to seal a covenant") are well-executed, though his 'voice' remains underdeveloped due to minimal dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from descent to ritual and resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the word limit is used effectively to imply a larger world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with evocative sensory details (dust, cold air, humming obsidian). The catacombs amplify the ritual's weight, though the cathedral's grandeur feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craft: symbolism (petrified lightning, ribbon), subtext (brokenness and renewal), and a resonant ending. The "show, don't tell" approach is nearly flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Fresh metaphors ("lament of what was broken") and nuanced emotion (ribbon's "lost promise"). No AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
