<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized, his "optimistically bitter" demeanor and fanaticism for puzzles drive the narrative with clear, consistent motivation, revealing depth through his penance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the puzzle-solving action driving toward a subtle resolution that feels complete despite the brevity. Pacing is deliberate but never sluggish.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and storm-lashed atmosphere are masterfully evoked, amplifying the isolation and weight of secrets. Sensory details (damp cardboard, brass tumblers) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (string as salvation, empty box as absolution) and subtext. The ending lingers, blending emotional resonance with thematic depth. Craft is polished and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "lethargic excitement" tone and nuanced handling of guilt feel fresh. Language is precise, avoiding purple prose while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving the reader with a sense of uneasy hope. A standout piece.</comment>
