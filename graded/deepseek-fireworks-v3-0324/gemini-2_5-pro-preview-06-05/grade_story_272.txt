<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his socially awkward inventor traits subtly influencing his obsessive, technical approach to emotional reckoning. His distinct voice and actions align well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's reverse-chronological structure is inventive and cohesive, with a clear arc from regret to tentative hope. Pacing is tight, and the method (reversed trails) enhances thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The diner's stale atmosphere and encrypted archive merge seamlessly, amplifying Leo's isolation. Sensory details (coffee, whistle's sound) deepen immersion without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling: metaphors ("tree of regret," "digital archaeology") are fresh, subtext is rich, and the ending lingers. Style elevates emotional impact without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original. The tonal lock system and wooden whistle defy clich√©. Nuanced emotion ("hopefully cynical") and precise details avoid AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, with creative fusion of tech and melancholy. Leaves a resonant, haunting question.</comment>
