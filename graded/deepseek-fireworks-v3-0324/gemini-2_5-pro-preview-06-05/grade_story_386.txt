<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and consistent. His actions—re-engineering the lighthouse, preserving memory—reveal his determination and grief. His "voice" is distinct, though dialogue is absent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc (preparation, launch, aftermath). The celestial trigger and catapult are logical extensions of Kaelen's goal. Pacing is deliberate but not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming reactor, groaning metal) heighten tension and isolation. The setting amplifies the story's melancholy defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tablecloth as map, catapult as hope). The ending is poignant and purposeful, leaving room for reflection. The theme of memory against oblivion is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Metaphors ("seed of memory," "borrowed dawn") are fresh. Emotional nuance is shown through action (the tear, reverent hands). No AI-generated clichés detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, amplifying its emotional weight. The lingering question of the seed's fate adds depth. A standout piece.</comment>
