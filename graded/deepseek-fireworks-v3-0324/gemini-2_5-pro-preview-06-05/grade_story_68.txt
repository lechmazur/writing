<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's moral code and motivation are clear, and his actions align well with his established traits. The bottle caps add depth, but his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc and effective pacing. The connection between the action (retrieving the name) and the resolution (adopting Elara's story) is strong.</comment>
