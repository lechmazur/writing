<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Elian's discovery of the censored book's magic forming a coherent arc. Pacing is deliberate but never sluggish, and the cause-effect relationship (reading → vision) is elegantly executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (rust, fog, cherry-red lacquer) elevating the setting into a character of its own. The abandoned ship feels alive with forgotten dreams.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Literary devices are masterfully deployed (e.g., "ghost-letters," "film clubs"), and the ending lingers with quiet satisfaction. Theme and subtext—beauty in decay—are woven seamlessly into the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. No clichés or AI-like repetitions. The voice is distinct, and the handling of "fierce repose" is subtle yet powerful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that transcends its constraints. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for resonance.</comment>
