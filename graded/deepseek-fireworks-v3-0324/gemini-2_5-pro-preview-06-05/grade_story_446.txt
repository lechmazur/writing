<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's dual identity as an amiable gambler and vengeful prince is compelling, with clear, consistent motivation driving his actions. His "voice" is distinct, though somewhat restrained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from fundraiser to firefly grounds. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly truncates the buildup of his schemes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and city contrast brilliantly, amplifying Leo's duality. Sensory details (e.g., brittle ledger pages, blinking fireflies) enrich the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("hydrolyze," "petals fall") and subtext. The ending lingers, marrying theme and action. Style elevates the quiet vengeance motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "peaceful anger" tone and layered schemes feel human, not algorithmic. Metaphors are precise and impactful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant question: How far will Leo go? Creative fusion of themes.</comment>
