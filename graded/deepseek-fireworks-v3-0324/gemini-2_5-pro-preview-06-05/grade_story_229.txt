<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and poignant, driving her absurd yet deeply personal quest. Her grief and determination are vividly portrayed, though her 'mild curiosity' could be more explicitly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent, though the rain-pattern method risks feeling overly technical for such an emotional climax.</comment>
