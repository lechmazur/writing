<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and compelling, his profession and personal quirks align well with his ghostly encounters. However, his 'elegantly clumsy' attribute could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from Leo's initial discomfort with silence to his resolution. Pacing is well-managed, though the ghost tour detour feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a brilliant, evocative setting that enhances the theme of fragility and legacy. Sensory details (like the elevator's hum) are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and subtext, with strong symbolism (the crumbling crown). The ending is satisfying, though the ghost tour exposition could be smoother.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply felt story where elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
