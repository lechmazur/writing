<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's fragility and desperation are palpable, and his backstory as a broken mercenary is well-integrated. The trembling hands and emotional weight of the amber are strong, though his 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with rumors, the Curator, and the amber forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "finalize" action could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cathedral's decay and street art contrast beautifully with Kael's grief. Sensory details (amber's warmth, shattered glass) deepen immersion. Setting and object are symbiotically linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (amber as frozen time, spider as loss) and subtext. The ending’s quiet resolution is profoundly satisfying. Writing style elevates every element.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("tremor of fear" vs. "vibration of a held note") and nuanced emotion. No clichés, though the "whispers" guiding him edge close to tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting resonance. Creative and deeply thematic.</comment>
