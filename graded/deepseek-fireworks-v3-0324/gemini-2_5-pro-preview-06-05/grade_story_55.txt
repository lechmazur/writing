<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Lyren’s action (eliciting nostalgia) driving a clear arc, though the new star’s birth feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The studio's sterile futurism contrasts brilliantly with the "forgotten revelry," and sensory details (e.g., the rust-pitted key) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (nostalgia vs. progress), potent symbolism (keys, bell), and a hauntingly satisfying ending elevate this.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("raucously silent"), nuanced emotion, and a distinctive voice avoid cliché. Only minor over-formality in phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering melancholy. Originality shines.</comment>
