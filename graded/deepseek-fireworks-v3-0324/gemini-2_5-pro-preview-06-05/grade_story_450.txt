<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's sharp-witted dancer background contrasts effectively with her linguistically inept struggle, making her mimicry poignant. Her motivation to fulfill the prophecy is clear but layered, revealing deeper denial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with mimicry driving the arc from denial to catharsis. Pacing is tight, though the chamber setting feels slightly underutilized for its weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lavender-steam atmosphere is evocative, but the thought experiment chamber's potential isn't fully mined. The patch's sinking is a standout sensory moment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (patch as fallen star) and subtext (prophecy as descent, not ascent). Emotional resonance is earned, not stated. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original twist on generational trauma. Fresh metaphors ("crushing choreography"), though "saturated ambivalence" toes the line of purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on legacy and performance.</comment>
