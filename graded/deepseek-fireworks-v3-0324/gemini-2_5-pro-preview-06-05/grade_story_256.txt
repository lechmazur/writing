<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and poetic, though slightly abstract. His "loyally disloyal" nature and yearning for the horizon are compelling, but deeper introspection could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The measuring spoon ritual is unique but lacks tangible stakes. Pacing is deliberate, bordering on sluggish.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exquisite world-building; the floating cafe and temporal mist are vividly rendered. Sensory details (ozone, dissolving foam) elevate the ethereal mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent symbolism (spoon as altar). The ending’s resigned hope lingers, though the conflict feels passive. Literary craft compensates for minor structural flaws.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("dawn-bruised edge") and originality in blending mundane/ethereal. Avoids clichés, though "frothy despair" skirts pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a melancholic, cohesive whole. The spoon and horizon are inspired choices, but the grocery store comparison feels tacked on.</comment>
