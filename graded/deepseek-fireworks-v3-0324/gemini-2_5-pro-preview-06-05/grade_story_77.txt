<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empathy is well-realized, her motivation clear and deeply tied to her actions. Her voice is distinct, especially in the marionette scene, where her quiet strength shines.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with Elara's method of marshaling the pirates through symbolism feeling organic. The arc from chaos to purpose is satisfying and coherent within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout is vividly rendered, with sensory details (synth-ale, grimy floor) enhancing the atmosphere. The starfish and marionette deepen the world's texture and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—symbolism (marionette, starfish) and subtext (rebirth from fragmentation) resonate powerfully. The ending is poignant and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The juxtaposition of space piracy with fragile relics (starfish, marionette) feels fresh, and the emotional nuance is subtle yet profound.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate narrative where every element serves the story. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving a lingering sense of hope and transformation.</comment>
