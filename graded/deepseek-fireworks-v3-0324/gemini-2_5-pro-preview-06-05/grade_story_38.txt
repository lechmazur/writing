<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and compelling, aligning well with their insomniac poet persona. The method of collecting confessions adds depth, though the drunken after-parties feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within the word limit, with a clear arc from haunting to resolution. Pacing is effective, but the transition between subway stops and attic could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (wilted herbs, moonbeam) enhancing the haunted attic. The subway setting contrasts effectively with the attic's claustrophobia.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism in herbs, whispers as lament). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of shared pain is layered and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in its approach to haunting and non-violence. Some phrases verge on purple ("empty abundance"), but the voice is distinct and emotionally nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The length feels deliberate, and the lingering sense of "fullness" elevates it beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
