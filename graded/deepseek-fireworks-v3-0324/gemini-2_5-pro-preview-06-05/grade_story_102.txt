<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mercenary's pragmatic yet conflicted nature is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation (gold vs. fear). His trembling hands and internal debate reinforce his "spineless" trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed—Elara's exposition feels dense for the word limit, though the key's reveal and Kael's choice create a sharp arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exemplary atmosphere: the eerie silence contrasts the earlier storm, and the map room's projections ("phantom mountain ranges") amplify the "uncharted horizons" concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key as world-altering artifact) and sensory details ("cold point of focus"). The ending lingers with thematic weight ("coward in a familiar hell").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("spine more suggestion than substance"). The dollhouse key's juxtaposition of delicacy and consequence is inspired.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the brevity feels intentional. The key and prophecy elevate the mercenary trope beyond cliché.</comment>
