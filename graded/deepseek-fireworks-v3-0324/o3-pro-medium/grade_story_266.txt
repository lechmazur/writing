<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moros is vividly portrayed with a clear, if enigmatic, motivation. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The absurd clock hand drives the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating rock yoga studio and dawn train create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (incense ropes, helium lanterns) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext, the story lingers in the mind. The ending is purposeful, though the 'molten neon' imagery slightly overwhelms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The bleak clown and absurd clock hand feel fresh, but the 'drifting promises' metaphor is overextended.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
