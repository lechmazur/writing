<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation and internal conflict are vividly rendered, with clear alignment between his brokenness and his audacious search for solace. His voice is distinct, though slightly overshadowed by poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression and excellent pacing. The resolution feels earned, though the prophecy's integration could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ephemeral gallery and winter setting are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (steam-breathing sculptures, candle-lit skulls) heightening atmosphere. The melting art mirrors the traveler's emotional thaw.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: layered symbolism (mirror, seedlings), resonant theme (power vs. renunciation), and a hauntingly purposeful ending. Only minor nitpicks—some metaphors border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh and original, avoiding clichés. The prose is lyrical but controlled. Slight over-reliance on nature-focused imagery risks monotony, but the emotional nuance elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, potent vignette. The length feels deliberate, and the elements interlock seamlessly. Lingers in the mind like melting snow—both delicate and profound.</comment>
