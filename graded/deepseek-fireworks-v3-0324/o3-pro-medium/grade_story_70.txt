<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartholomew's uptight nature and his internal conflict ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") are well-developed, but his transformation feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, with a clear arc, though the pacing is tight—some moments (e.g., the bulb's activation) could benefit from more space to breathe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details that enhance the eerie yet hopeful mood. The gravestones and lunar orchids enrich the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and a resonant theme of transformation. The ending is satisfying, though the witch's demand for "thunder" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("composted moonflowers"), but the emotional depth and fresh imagery stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than feeling forced. The brief length works, though a touch more development would elevate it further.</comment>
