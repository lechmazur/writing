<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marrow's ghostly nature and motivation to communicate with animals are clear and compelling, though his "solemnly silly" attribute could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc from Marrow's intent to perforate the veil to the pact with the animals. The forbidden logs are a clever catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (steam, chimes, citrine eyes) immerse the reader brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (straw as conduit, logs as forbidden knowledge) and subtext (communication vs. control). The ending lingers, though the "gentle chaos" tone occasionally disrupts focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original and stylistically distinct. Avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors ("paper-winged crow") and nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
