<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ril's distinct "analytically innovative" patience and motivation to unearth the relic are clear and consistent, but their "nondescript" nature could be more vividly contrasted with their internal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the rain-as-password moment slightly strains plausibility. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party detritus create a richly atmospheric backdrop. Sensory details (petrichor, flickering lights) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (astrolabe, rain) and subtext. The ending’s "slower orbit of accountability" lingers with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the mythic relic concept, though "delayed justice" borders on familiar. Metaphors are fresh, and prose avoids purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative where elements serve the story’s depth. The brief length feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
