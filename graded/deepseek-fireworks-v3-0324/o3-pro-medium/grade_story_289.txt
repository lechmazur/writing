<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivations and actions align beautifully with her "brainy observer" role, and her distinct voice shines through the first-person narration. The porcelain doll's symbolism enriches her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from curiosity to resolution. Pacing is brisk but deliberate, and cause/effect logic holds. Minor quibble: corporate salvage crews feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered, with sensory details (plankton flares, salt spray) enhancing mood. Setting and object (doll) merge seamlessly into the theme of fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism, evocative prose, and a resonant theme elevate this. The ending crystallizes the message without preachiness. Only nit: "lightning freighters" imagery slightly clashes with the softer tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("weakness is the shore where strength docks"). Nuanced handling of emotion through subtext. Style feels uniquely lyrical, not AI-generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. Lingering impact: the paradox of strength through vulnerability.</comment>
