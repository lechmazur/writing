<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong, distinct voice and clear motivation. The hacker's moral code and redemption theme are well-integrated, but minor room for deeper exploration of personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight, efficient structure with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing suffers slightly from dense worldbuilding in the middle, but resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric blending of cyberpunk and antiquity. Sensory details (steam, clinking caps) elevate immersion, though the oracle's manifestation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful subtext on redemption and erasure. Literary devices (graffiti reversing time, "universe inhaling") are fresh and impactful. Ending lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and perspective. Avoids tropes, with nuanced emotion (e.g., "purpose heavier than fear"). Minor over-reliance on nostalgia as currency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful despite complexity. Elements serve theme elegantly. Leaves reader questioning historical erasureâ€”a hallmark of layered storytelling.</comment>
