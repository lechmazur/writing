<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eirin's motivation and actions are clear and consistent, with her gentle nature and conjurer abilities shaping her approach to justice and rebuilding the garden. Her distinct voice and personality shine through her reversed messages.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain from the broken branch to the garden's revival. Pacing is excellent within the word limit, and the arc feels complete and resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground dwarven city and silent forest are vividly rendered, with sensory details (azur torchlight, dripping stalactite melodies) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the themes and action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of the butterfly, reversed language) create layers of meaning. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of justice as an 'inscrutably obvious' path is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (destiny cracking like a geode) and nuanced emotion. The story avoids tropes and clich√©s, offering a unique perspective on justice and restoration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, serving the story rather than feeling imposed. The brevity feels intentional, and the ending lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
