<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's eagerness and motivation to prove the ghosts are data patterns are clear and consistent. Their "voice" is distinct, especially in the whispered negotiation with the spirits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from skepticism to resolution. The pacing is efficient, and the cause-and-effect logic (e.g., the sewing box’s appearance triggering the climax) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The villa’s hybrid ancient/futuristic setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (lavender oil, luminous runes) enhancing atmosphere. The contrast between marble and tech creates a unique mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext about connection across time elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, and literary devices (e.g., sewing as metaphor for dialogue) are deftly used. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Remarkably original, blending ghosts and tech without cliché. Nuanced emotions (e.g., the "messy residue of supernatural chat logs") avoid AI-generic phrasing. The style is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a layered, evocative whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the boundaries of technology and humanity.</comment>
