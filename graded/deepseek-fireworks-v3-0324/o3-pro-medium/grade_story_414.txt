<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhea's characterization is vivid and consistent with her "pleasantly troublesome" nature. Her motives (honoring whispers) align with her actions, though the narrator's internal conflict could be explored further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically but feels slightly rushed in the transition from dance to scrimshaw’s revelation. Cause/effect is clear, though pacing tightens unnaturally near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake and scrimshaw create a mesmerizing atmosphere. Sensory details (turquoise glow, phantom currents) are exceptionally evocative and integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whalebone as memory) and a layered theme (art’s resonance). Ending is poignant but could linger more on the narrator’s transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh—avoids clichés. The scrimshaw’s role is inventive, and Rhea’s voice feels distinct. Nuanced emotion (terror/calling) elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. Short length suits the lyrical style, though the dance class setup feels underdeveloped compared to the scrimshaw’s prominence.</comment>
