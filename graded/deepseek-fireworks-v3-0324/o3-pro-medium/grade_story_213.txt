<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sentinel's dual duty—guardian of the heliophore and stories—is compellingly nuanced, though Mara's role could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's tension between narrative sustenance and destruction is taut and coherent, though the restaurant scene slightly distracts from the lab's stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lab's mythic photosynthesis and the restaurant's artificial dawn create a haunting, immersive dissonance. Sensory details (e.g., "lightless smoke") excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Masterful subtext: light as metaphor for storytelling. Silence as destruction is a stunning, resonant reversal. Ending lingers like an eclipse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No clichés. Fresh metaphors ("chloroplastic algorithms starved for narrative nutrition") and a bold, original premise. Voice is distinct and controlled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a singular vision. The lab's setting feels organic, not imposed. The brevity heightens the fable-like weight.</comment>
