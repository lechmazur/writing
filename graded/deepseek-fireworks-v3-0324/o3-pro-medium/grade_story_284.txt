<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fletcher's stoic yet ironically earnest persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. Mira's untamed sincerity contrasts effectively, though her backstory is hinted rather than explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently with a clear arc; the wallet/paper plane device and jazz band’s silence are clever catalysts. Pacing is tight but not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The apiary’s amber dusk and bar’s jazz trio create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (honey scent, buzzing bees) enhance mood and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Elegant use of symbolism (bees as amplifiers of moral expectation) and subtext. Ending is poignant, with layered themes of courage and connection. Dialogue feels organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "meteor of feeling") are striking. Nuanced emotion and individual style elevate it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering emotional impact and thematic weight.</comment>
