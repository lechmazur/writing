<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Caras Mai's motivation is complex and clear, with a haunting duality between duty and personal redemption. Her actions and hesitation reveal depth, though slightly more internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action driving toward a resonant, unexpected resolution. The pacing excels within the word limit, though the transition from assassination to image-capture could use slight smoothing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (gilded spires, refracted light) enriching the atmosphere. The world feels alive and thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking literary devices (kaleidoscopic shards, "bleeding doubt") and subtext about power and hope create a memorable impact. The ending is purposeful, though the thematic payoff could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lush but purposeful, with fresh metaphors ("prophecy via spider's web"). Nuanced emotion and style distinguish it from generic AI output.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, serving the story's depth. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about redemption. Creative and polished, though the climax risks slight abstraction.</comment>
