<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "social media exorcist" feels slightly underdeveloped. The protagonist's voice is distinct and aligns with their "indifferent enthusiasm."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the mess hall feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with evocative sensory details. The abandoned music hall and mess hall are vividly rendered and enhance the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending is purposeful and lingers. Writing style elevates the story's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Emotion is nuanced, not stated outright.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively into the narrative. The story feels deliberate and leaves a haunting impression. Creative and memorable.</comment>
