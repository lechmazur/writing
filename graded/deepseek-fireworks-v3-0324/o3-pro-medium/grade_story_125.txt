<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underachieving mage's motivation is clear and consistent, with their 'exceptionally usual' attribute driving creative problem-solving. Their voice is distinct, blending self-deprecation with quiet determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with misdelivered packages and the doll head elegantly driving the action. Pacing is brisk but purposeful, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and ghost-grey farmland create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (blinking optics, rusty panels) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "foreclosure on heritage") and symbolism (the curtain as revelation). The ending delivers emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh—avoids clichés despite magic/space trappings. The doll head as a sarcastic coach is particularly inventive. Nuanced handling of boredom and excitement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions about mediocrity and reinvention.</comment>
