<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alia's subdued vigilante persona and motivation to master the Spiral Blades' scripture are compelling and consistent. Her "artfully clumsy" gait adds depth and tactical deception.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The funhouse mirror method is inventive, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (graffiti ghosts, generator hiccups) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext. The ending lingers with thematic weight. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its surface action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. No clich√©s; the war theme is handled with nuance. Language is purposeful, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about war's true cost.</comment>
