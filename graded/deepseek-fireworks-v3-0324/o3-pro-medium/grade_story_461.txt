<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Merrick's irate nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to heal old wounds is clear and compelling. His sardonic glee adds depth, though it occasionally overshadows subtle emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from search to resolution. The heartbeat meditation method is inventive, though the reveal of the pendant feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (dust, moonbeams, rot) that enhance the eerie, nostalgic mood. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (pendant as metronome) and subtext (generational sacrifice). The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue with ghosts could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The writing style is distinctive, with fresh metaphors ("sardonic glee crackled like static"). Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of understanding familial wounds.</comment>
