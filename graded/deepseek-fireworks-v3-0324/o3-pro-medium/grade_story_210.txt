<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Uriel Dov is vividly characterized through his actions and dialogue, with a clear motivation ("to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams") that drives the plot. His "amiable scholar" demeanor and reactions to the crossword and shadows reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the crossword and lighthouse serving as coherent anchors. The resolution (sister's message) ties back neatly to the initial conflict, though the word limit slightly rushes the final beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is masterfully evoked through sensory details (moaning winds, flickering lights) and atmospheric tension. The setting amplifies both action and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (e.g., shadows as "language"), layered themes (memory vs. bureaucracy), and a resonant ending. The writing style elevates the narrative without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The crossword-as-map metaphor and "doubly singular" pursuit feel fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., shadows "sighed with recognition") demonstrate human-like depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of unresolved legacy and light.</comment>
