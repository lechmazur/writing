<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Serin's motivation as a lovelorn spy is clear and consistent, but his backstory feels slightly underexplored given the tight word limit. Liora's characterization is strong, though her sudden shift to gloating could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the avalanche metaphor feels slightly overused. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution is satisfying despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and vivid, with sensory details (neon drizzle, microdrones) enhancing the futuristic slums. The atmosphere perfectly complements the tension and romance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Literary devices (reflections as symbolism, "destiny rambled" as metaphor) are used masterfully. The ending lingers with thematic weight, though Serin's internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The sticky label as a talisman is inventive, though the "unstoppable avalanche" phrasing edges toward familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberately concise, with elements serving the story elegantly. Leaves a haunting question about identity and escape.</comment>
