<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhian and Jutren are vividly drawn, with motivations deeply tied to their pasts. Jutren's refusal to kneel to the present and Rhian's role as a healer of time are compelling. Their distinct voices and actions align with their traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from anticipation to resolution. The catapult's signal, the lighthouse's rotation, and the gyroscope's spin drive the story forward logically. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like reactor cores pulsing "like caged auroras" and the smell of ozone elevate the world-building. The setting feels integral to the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the tablecloth as passport/shroud). The ending is poignant and resonant, with layered themes of memory and exile. The writing style enhances the story's lyrical, otherworldly tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("the lighthouse's copper throat") and nuanced emotional subtext. No generic descriptors—every detail feels purposeful and unique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where all elements serve the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and thematically rich.</comment>
