<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orla's motivation is clear and compelling, with her abilities and past traumas shaping her actions. Her 'voice' is distinct, though some nuances of her internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the stadium setting's integration feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The yodeling valley and rain trails create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (taste, sound) are masterfully deployed to reinforce theme and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (paperclip, consomme) and layered subtext elevate the story. Emotional resonance is strong, though the ending's resolution skirts sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "tasted her mother's laughter, delicate and lemony"). Avoids clich√©s, though "forgiveness' embrace" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling intentional. Lingers emotionally, though the stadium scene slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
