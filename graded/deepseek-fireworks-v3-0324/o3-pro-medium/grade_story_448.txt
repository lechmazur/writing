<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elaris is vividly portrayed, with his distrust and ambition driving his actions; motivations are clear and consistent, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect; the sewing machine's stoppage propels the story forward, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is superb, with rich sensory details (soot, cedar wax) enhancing atmosphere; setting and object (candlestick) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (e.g., flame mirroring Elaris's defiance) and subtext (hidden manifestos) deepen impact; theme of innovation vs. secrecy is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s; metaphors (e.g., "ridges in the shell translated metal groans") are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story feels deliberate and complete, leaving a lingering sense of intrigue about Elaris's legacy.</comment>
