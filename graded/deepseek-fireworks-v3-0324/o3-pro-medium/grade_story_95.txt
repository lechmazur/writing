<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brother Kajo's weariness and devotion to forgotten languages are vividly portrayed, with his actions and dialogue deeply aligned with his motivation. The character's distinct 'voice' shines through his whispered yet booming speech, though his aging from utterances could be more explicitly tied to his physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Kajo's arrival and demonstration seamlessly driving the narrative toward revelation. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the storm's immediate response to his button ritual slightly strains cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The storm-chasing headquarters is electrifyingly atmospheric, with humming instruments and phosphorescent screens enhancing the eerie mood. Sensory details are masterfully deployed, particularly in describing the buttons' jingle and the storm's pressure shifts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (language as weather, memory as storm), the story's layered metaphors and haunting ending resonate deeply. The prose is lyrical yet purposeful, though the "forgotten dance" motif could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors (buttons as syllables) and nuanced emotional beats (Mora's shared hunger). No clich√©s or AI hallmarks; the voice feels distinctly human and stylistically daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, transcendent vignette where every element serves the theme of linguistic reclamation. The length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with lingering awe at the fusion of myth and meteorology.</comment>
