<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's structure is tight and coherent, with reversed patterns and contrasts logically driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with sensory details (luminous fruit, silver seeds) enhancing the eerie, mythic tone. The temple's duality of ruin and orchard is masterfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using rich symbolism (mirrors, echoes) and subtext to explore themes of redemption. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>
