<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his freelancing nature with a deeper, almost philosophical undertone. His actions align well with his established traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the cause-effect chain is logical. The steam-pressure trick is a standout moment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and vivid, with sensory details (steam hissing, gears spinning) enhancing the steampunk atmosphere. The setting perfectly supports the story's tone and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "wisdom is machinery tuned to compassion"), layered meaning, and a satisfying, resonant ending. The theme of preserving intangible value is poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, with fresh metaphors ("city spires glint like untouched cake knives"). Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with quiet power. Superior craftsmanship.</comment>
