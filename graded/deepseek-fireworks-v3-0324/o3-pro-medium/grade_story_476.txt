<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Roan's "gentle brawler" persona is vividly portrayed, with his actions (punching to hug, playful jabs) aligning with his motivation to chronicle social change. His notebook and spice box reveal depth, though his nonchalance could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows well despite brevity, with the flat tire and Echo Chamber serving as logical catalysts. The ending feels purposeful, but the transition from refuge to revelation is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive, with graffiti, wind, and spice dust creating a vivid atmosphere. The Echo Chamber's acoustic symbolism elevates the action, though the timeframe ("between verses") feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spices as syllables, echoes as voices) and layered themes (social change, memory) stand out. The ending resonates, but some metaphors border on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (coriander as static, punches as verbs) avoid clich√©. Only minor stiffness in Roan's "peculiarly natural" reactions hints at AI.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce artfully, with the spice box and Echo Chamber driving theme. The brevity feels deliberate, though the flat tire's resolution is somewhat glossed over.</comment>
