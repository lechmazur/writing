<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and nuanced, with the archer’s disillusionment and shift to chronicling social movements revealing depth. However, the "disappointed archer" trait feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well within constraints, but the Bridge of Regret’s resolution leans slightly abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the comb’s role could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the inverted waterfall and celestial bodies enhancing the surreal tone. Sensory details (e.g., "slick obsidian slabs") are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (comb as bent arrows) and subtext (regret vs. action). Ending is resonant and thematically satisfying, with sharp literary craft throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Nuanced emotion ("passionate disinterest") and fresh metaphors elevate it, though a few phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that lingers. The brief length feels intentional, with each detail serving the story’s depth and momentum.</comment>
