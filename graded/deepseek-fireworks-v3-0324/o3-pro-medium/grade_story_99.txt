<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's telekinesis and casual demeanor create a compelling juxtaposition, but deeper introspection into their past could elevate their motivation beyond mere discovery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's cohesion is impressive, with sound bites and flashbacks weaving seamlessly into the revival arc. Pacing is tight but risks slight abruptness in transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carnival booth is a masterstroke—decayed yet vivid, amplifying the theme of forgotten magic. Sensory details (soy scent, rusted bells) are razor-sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the chopstick wrapper's symbolism and the fusion of alchemy with carnival debris. Minor risk of "grandiose subtlety" tipping into opacity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm: elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a phantom ache—the mark of a tale that lingers.</comment>
