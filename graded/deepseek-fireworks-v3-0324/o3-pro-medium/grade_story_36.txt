<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gideon's characterization is vivid and distinct, with his "calm doomsayer" persona deeply influencing his actions and dialogue. His motivation to resist stagnation is clear and consistently drives the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the skateboard's symbolic role and the workshop's steampunk mechanics logically advancing the theme. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and dawn setting are richly detailed, with sensory immersion (hissing dew, ticking gears) enhancing the atmosphere. The world feels cohesive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("gods of stagnation rattling cups") and symbolism (skateboard as hinge). The ending resonates, and the theme of innocence vs. progress is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, and the steampunk-meets-rebellion concept feels innovative. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story feels both complete and expansive despite its brevity. The style is purposeful and evocative, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
