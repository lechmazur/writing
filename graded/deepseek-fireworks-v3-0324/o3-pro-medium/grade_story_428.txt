<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Raghav's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his internal conflict ("rarely authentic") feels underexplored. His motivation and actions align well, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect. The pivot from deal-making to refusal is deftly handled, though the broker's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is vividly evoked, with sensory details (e.g., "moist soil") enhancing atmosphere. The Nandi statue is a standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink blotter as vow), layered themes, and a resonant ending. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its word count.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("heirloom grenade"). Avoids tropes, though Raghav's prepper archetype skirts familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where every element serves the narrative. Leaves the reader with lingering questions about resilience and integrity.</comment>
