<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jaro's edgy, pessimistic nature is well-developed and drives his actions, but his motivation to navigate the void could be more explicitly tied to his trade background.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-structured, with a clear arc from Jaro's resolution to his realization about memory's distortion. Pacing is effective despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mushroom house and windmill setting creates a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like "moist spores" and "fibrous rafters" enhance the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "dreams rubbed against mildew"). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of memory as mutable space is deeply evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors ("nervous pupil" for the candle). Avoids clich√©s and AI pitfalls, though "edgy tradesman" borders on tropey without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite multiple assigned elements. Leaves a lingering question about memory's relationship to space, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
