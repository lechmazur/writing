<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilan's urban hermit persona and side hustle are well-integrated, but his motivation to "forge new paths" could be more deeply explored. His actions with the zipper pull and folklore are evocative but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Ilan's rebellion to the city's reaction. The method of propagating folklore feels original, though the ending's pacing leans slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nebula deck's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending cosmic grandeur with urban grit. Sensory details (e.g., "indigo riddles," "metallic hush") deepen immersion, though the "unspoken promises" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (zipper as detonator, broken closure) and literary craft. The ending’s thematic resonance—disbelief mutating into pilgrimage—elevates the story beyond its word limit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of "absurd solemnity" and fresh metaphors ("gravity wearing a tie"). Minor stiffness in "impersonally personal" phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive vignette. Elements serve the story’s depth, leaving a lingering question about myth-making. Brief length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
