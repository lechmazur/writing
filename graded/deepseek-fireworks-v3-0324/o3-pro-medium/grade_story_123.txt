<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashwyn's motivation and personality are vividly drawn, with his "gleefully morose" demeanor and brewing as an act of rebellion standing out. His distinct voice and consistent actions align well with his hopeful yet mournful outlook.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with brewing as a metaphor for societal renewal driving the narrative. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels organic despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (dust, fermented vapors, smoked lavender) enhancing the mood. The abandoned facility and transitionary timeframe amplify the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (yeast as revival, boots as perseverance) and layered subtext. The ending is deeply satisfying, leaving a lingering emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dialogue that turned chemical into cosmic"). The prose is purposeful, and the emotional nuance feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates all elements into a resonant whole. The brevity serves the narrative, and the theme of fermentation as rebellion lingers provocatively.</comment>
