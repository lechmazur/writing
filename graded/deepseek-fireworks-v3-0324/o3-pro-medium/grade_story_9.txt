<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's "mildly panicked soothsayer" persona is intriguing and distinct, though their motivation to "shape destiny" could be more deeply explored. Their voice drips with sarcasm, which aligns well with the tone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect progression. The puzzle box serves as a compelling driver, though the rapid resolution of locks 3-9 slightly undermines tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert billboard maze is breathtakingly vivid, with rich sensory details (smoke, condensation, leaking batteries) that amplify the story's irony and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "radioactive dominoes," "molten sarcasm") and symbolism. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of environmental stewardship is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "probably unlikely" Morse code pulse and the puzzle box's mechanics showcase clever, human-like ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, and the word count feels deliberate. The story lingers with existential weight, questioning commodified salvation.</comment>
