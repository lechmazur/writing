<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aralune's motivation and character are vividly drawn, with her "timidly bold" nature and disenchantment driving her actions. Her voice is distinct, though her internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from disenchantment to cosmic rupture. Pacing is excellent for the length, and cause-effect logic is impeccable. Minor risk of abstraction in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is stunning—sensory details (luminescent slime, spore-choked chimes) merge with atmosphere to heighten the story's ethereal tension. A masterclass in immersive setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sacrifice as metallic stains, mycelia-like conviction) and lyrical prose elevate this. Ending resonates, though the inventor's arrival feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "silence bleeding into melody"). Minor stiffness in "ceremonial doubt" phrasing, but overall avoids AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite density of elements. Leaves lingering wonder—proof that constraints can fuel creativity.</comment>
