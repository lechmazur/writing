<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kara's impulsively thoughtful nature and motivation to shelter Lyrix are clear and well-integrated, though her "brazen raider" aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a logical cause-and-effect chain and effective pacing. The climax (charcoal interference lattice) resolves cleanly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive, with vivid bioluminescent imagery and drowned corridors. The underwater lab enhances tension and mood brilliantly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact narrative where elements serve the story organically. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
