<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The introverted dancer's distinct voice and motivation are vividly portrayed, with consistent alignment between traits and actions. The dance-as-code metaphor is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is exceptional, with a tight arc from arrival to departure. Pacing balances urgency and reflection, though the final elevator reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stellar atmospheric immersion; the cipher office and wasteland contrasts are hauntingly evoked through sensory detail (sandstorms, cracked dome). The charts feel organic to both setting and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates thematic depth, with masterful symbolism (knitting stars, echoes as choreography). The ending’s ambiguity lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice; avoids clichés through fresh metaphors (e.g., "gears groan like an orchestra tuning"). Nuanced emotional subtext replaces stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive, stylistically assured whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant thematic echoes.</comment>
