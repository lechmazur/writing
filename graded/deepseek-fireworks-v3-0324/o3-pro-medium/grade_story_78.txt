<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iris's late-blooming heroism is subtly but effectively woven into her actions and reflections, though her "softly militant" attribute could be more distinctly showcased.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with a clear arc from loss to revelation, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the transition to her epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building; the post-apocalyptic rooftop farm and storm-pummeled atmosphere are visceral and thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, though a few phrases ("terrorizingly gentle") edge toward overwrought. Emotion is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about balance and rebirth.</comment>
