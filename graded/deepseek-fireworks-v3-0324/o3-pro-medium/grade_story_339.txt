<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desmond's internal conflict and guilt are vividly portrayed, with the drawer knob serving as a potent symbol of his past. His motivation is clear, though his "joyless" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the seesaw and museum construction elegantly mirroring Desmond's emotional arc. Pacing is deftly managed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prismatic lake and scaffolding create a haunting, reflective atmosphere. Sensory details (the seesaw's creak, the lake's refraction) enrich the mood and character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "dagger of unfinished apologies") and symbolism. The ending is both satisfying and open-ended, with strong thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh, original prose with minimal clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though the "cautious abandon" tone feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
