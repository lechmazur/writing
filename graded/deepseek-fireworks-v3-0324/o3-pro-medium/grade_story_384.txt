<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viora's frantic energy and culinary background are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and discoveries. Her motivation to expose truth through food is clear and compelling, though her transition from cook to seismic prophet could use more grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the eraser and walking stick serving as clever conduits for revelation. Pacing is brisk but coherent, though the climax's sudden institutional collapse feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The facility's sterile chaos and the letters' ancient dust create a haunting, tactile atmosphere. Sensory details (flour dust, spice scents) masterfully bridge the mundane and mystical.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (recipe-as-prophecy) and subtext (suppression vs. nourishment). The ending resonates with thematic richness, though the seismic shift to collective awakening could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of culinary and geological lore. Prose avoids clich√©, though "frenzied tranquility" slightly strains credulity. The ciphered recipe concept is dazzlingly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The story thrives within its constraints, leaving a lingering question about the symbiosis of human intuition and institutional dogma.</comment>
