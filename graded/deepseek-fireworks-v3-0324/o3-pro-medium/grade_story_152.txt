<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ralio's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "frenzied" nature feels underdeveloped beyond juggling. The love letter adds depth, but his emotional arc lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstraction. The tea-leaf method is inventive, but the transition to rescuing libraries feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—every detail (drowned cities, phosphorescent dust) immerses. The void and abandoned summer harmonize perfectly with the story's melancholy hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending is haunting, though the thematic weight occasionally overshadows immediate emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "bridges crossing the cavernous dark"). No clichés, though some phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the juggler motif slightly strains logic. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering, resonant question.</comment>
