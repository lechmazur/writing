<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Myra's telepathic ability and vintage button hook deepen her uniqueness, but her motivation (decoding journals) could be more seamlessly integrated with her barista role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the cloak's role in accessing journals is clever, though the glacier glyph connection feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersiveâ€”steam, oily wind, and frost-scarred lockbox create a vivid, tactile world. The dock setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich subtext (e.g., "listening differently can mend more than machines") elevates the narrative. Foam-art forecasts are a standout device.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in Myra's method and the glacier glyphs, but the telepathy-barista combo leans slightly gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the dock's purpose feels secondary. The ending's thematic resonance lingers beautifully.</comment>
