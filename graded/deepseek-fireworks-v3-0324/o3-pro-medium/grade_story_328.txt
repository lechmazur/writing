<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lennie's assertively meek nature and bartender role create a distinct, compelling voice. Motivation to escape the labyrinth is clear, but the "xenialize" action feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the tapestry method's technical exposition briefly disrupts flow. The ending resolves neatly, though the drone interaction feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Superb atmosphere—desert glare, mirage oasis, and holographic maze are vividly rendered. Sensory details (sand squeaking like bar stools) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich literary craft (firework metaphor, rebel-circuit tapestry), but the theme of technology's hollowness leans slightly didactic. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original: "xenialize" and tapestry-as-antenna defy tropes. Minor AI tells in phrasing ("algorithmic brochure," "unquantified warmth").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the greeting card’s role could be sharper. Brief length feels intentional, leaving resonant questions.</comment>
