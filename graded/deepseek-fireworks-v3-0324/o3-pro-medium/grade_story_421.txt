<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Master Petalus's motivations are vividly clear, balancing dread and desire, though the narrator's nomadic nature feels slightly underdeveloped beyond their role as helmsman.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent and compelling, with a strong cause-and-effect chain, though the resolution of Petalus's collapse feels abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is lushly rendered, with sensory details (pansies like "vibrant regrets," orchid-spoked wheel) amplifying the tension between stasis and flux.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wheel as paradox, coin as fate) and layered subtext (immortality vs. transience) elevate the story. The ending resonates with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and tonally consistent, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "wolf wearing lace"). Nuanced emotions avoid AI-generic phrasing, though "ferociously polite" slightly over-repeats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge organically, with the wheel and coin anchoring thematic depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering contemplation.</comment>
