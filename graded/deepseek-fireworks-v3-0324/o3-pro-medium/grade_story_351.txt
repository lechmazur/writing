<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lysander’s dreamy yet rebellious nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to reclaim forgotten history is compelling and consistent with his poet’s soul. His voice shines in the lyrical narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the sundial’s mystery, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the word limit. Pacing is strong, but transitions could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric blend of ivy-choked decay and mystical tension is masterful. Sensory details (dust, lilies, brass warmth) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies the thematic weight of memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and potent symbolism (sundial as amnesia’s measure, ivy as revival) elevate the story. The ending resonates, though some metaphors verge on overripe. Theme of unremembered lives is hauntingly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the sundial’s role and Mara’s archival magic, but certain phrases ("eggshell sky") flirt with cliché. Emotional depth feels genuine, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements meld organically, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers with poetic force, though tighter cohesion could elevate it further.</comment>
