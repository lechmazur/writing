<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Adria's transition from orchardist to smuggler is compelling, but her motivation could delve deeper into personal stakes. Her "gloomy" nature is well-integrated but risks being one-note.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The climax (orchard counterwave) is inventive, though the mercenary confrontation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric richness—bruised twilight, resonant vaults, and holographic fruit create a haunting, cohesive world. Sensory details elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with potent symbolism (skull as seed, lullabies as harvest). Ending resonates thematically, though the shift to altruism could be foreshadowed more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("frost-split pomegranate") and subversion of tropes (lullabies as volatile artifacts) showcase originality. No clichés or AI-generated flatness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a poetic, thematically dense narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
