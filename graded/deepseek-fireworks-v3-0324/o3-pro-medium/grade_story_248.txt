<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Icosa's guilt and determination are vividly portrayed, but her "unsteady" trait feels underutilized beyond physical tremors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, purposeful pacing with a clear arc. The prophecy’s twist resolves cleanly, though the "worlds colliding" concept lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with metallic sensory details, but the setting leans generic for sci-fi. The bird’s "coyly furious" rhythm stands out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("universe sharpened its teeth") and layered theme—fate vs. choice. Ending resonates with quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (e.g., "compressed starlight") and nuanced emotion. Only minor flaw: "cheerless ecstasy" feels slightly overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The word limit feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of resilience.</comment>
