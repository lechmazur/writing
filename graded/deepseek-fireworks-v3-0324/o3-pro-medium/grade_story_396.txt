<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jules' forgetfulness and scavenger intuition are well-integrated, but Selma's 'disinterested passion' feels slightly underdeveloped. Their motivations are clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the negotiation’s resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the cathedral shard and the champagne vault is inventive and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive—dusty vaults, resonant basses, and champagne mist create a rich sensory backdrop that elevates the story’s mood and stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical yet purposeful, with strong imagery (e.g., "condensed dawn," "timpani shocks"). The ending lingers, though Selma’s analytical voice could be sharper in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés with fresh metaphors ("resonance of cork pops") and a unique negotiation dynamic. The forgetful scavenger trope is subverted deftly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s brevity feels intentional, and elements like the shard and vault amplify theme and tension. A slight refinement of Selma’s character would perfect cohesion.</comment>
