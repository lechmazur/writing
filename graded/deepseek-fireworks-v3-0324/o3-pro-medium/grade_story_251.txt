<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jeru's ambivalence and "happily sad" burden are vividly rendered, but his motivation to scramble the scoreboard could be more deeply explored to align with his prophetic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect chain is tight, with the oath and defragmentation driving tension, though the puzzle-edge method feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony’s atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (dust, rust) amplifying the prophetic stakes. The marbles as "translucent moons" is a standout connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and layered symbolism (marbles as scoreboard, silence as prophecy) elevate the storytelling. The ending’s ambiguity resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("voice of bashful arrogance") and subverted tropes (prophet as flawed algorithm) showcase originality. Only minor over-formality in phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, with the oath and scoreboard serving as thematic anchors. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
