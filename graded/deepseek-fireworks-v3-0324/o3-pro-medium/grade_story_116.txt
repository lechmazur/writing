<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his artistic temperament, though his "subjectively rational" nature could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a satisfying arc despite brevity, though the resolution leans slightly abstract for immediate impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with sensory details (e.g., night-blooming jasmine, obsidian table) enhancing the atmosphere seamlessly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with fresh metaphors and a voice that avoids clich√©. Only minor overreach in "laconic exuberance" feels slightly strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize brilliantly, with the tight word count feeling deliberate. Lingers in the mind like a half-remembered melody.</comment>
