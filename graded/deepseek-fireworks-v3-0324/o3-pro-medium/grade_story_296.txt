<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The traveler's enigmatic presence and clear but unconventional motivation are compelling, though their 'hatefully adored' trait could be more explicitly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds organically, with the chopsticks and cookbook serving as elegant pivots. The tight word limit is masterfully used, though the climax's resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The submarine facility's atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant, with sensory details (buzzing fluorescents, deepsea quiet) amplifying the story's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken chopsticks as divining rods) and layered themes (chaos/order, faith) elevate the prose. The ending lingers, though the dialogue could feel less didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving the reader with a visceral yearning.</comment>
