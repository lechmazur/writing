<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and poetic, though his "theoretical creativity" could be more deeply explored. His voice is distinct and his actions align with his regret-driven quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from regret to resolution. Pacing is strong, though the frost-reading method slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The waterfall library and pressed leaves are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details that elevate the atmosphere. A near-perfect fusion of setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered metaphors ("augmenting the sky's memory") create profound impact. The ending lingers beautifully, though the frost device feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lush but purposeful, though some phrases ("cold blank oracle") verge on over-decoration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The brevity serves the story, and the interplay of elements feels deliberate and artful.</comment>
