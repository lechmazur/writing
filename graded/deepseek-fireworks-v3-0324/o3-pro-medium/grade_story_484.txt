<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis's motivations and actions are vividly drawn, with his dual thirst for caffeine and conviction adding depth. His "flippant solemnity" and brewer's background create a distinct voice, though his arc could delve deeper into his transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the mirror shard and staircase serving as effective catalysts. The resolution feels slightly abrupt, but the cause-and-effect chain holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted graveyard and protest backdrop merge seamlessly, with sensory details (hops in beard, amber handprint) enhancing atmosphere. The "uniquely generic" moonlit mausoleums are a standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (malt, mirror, fermentation) and layered themes (protest, integrity) elevate the prose. The ending’s keg-corking metaphor is striking, though some devices feel overly deliberate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The brewer’s superstition and "barley-scented defiance" showcase a unique style. Minor tonal wobbles in "flippant solemnity" execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about activism’s "recipe." Only the staircase method slightly strains logic.</comment>
