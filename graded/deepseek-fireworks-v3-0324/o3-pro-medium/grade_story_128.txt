<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seti's hesitantly bold nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to see the world clearly is consistent and compelling. His transformation from archer to storyteller is nuanced and believable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The fading photograph and jumbled subtitles drive the narrative forward without feeling rushed. The arc is complete and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient Egyptian setting is richly evoked through sensory details (sand, incense, alabaster). The atmosphere of "daring caution" enhances the tension and complements Seti’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (metaphors, symbolism) and layered subtext. The ending is purposeful, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual impact. The theme of storytelling’s power is masterfully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The blending of modern elements (TV subtitles) with ancient Egypt feels fresh, and the prose avoids clichés. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety and nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with all elements serving the narrative. The brevity enhances its impact, and the combination of ideas is inventive. Leaves the reader reflecting on storytelling’s transformative power.</comment>
