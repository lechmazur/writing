<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lorn's motivation is clear but his "technically wild" attribute lacks depth. His reaction to the scale reveals his internal conflict, but his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot moves logically, but the climax feels slightly rushed. The connection between mapping and immortality is compelling, though the resolution leans on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the story's mood, though the "hush before the verdict" could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor and symbolism, but the ending's thematic weight is slightly undermined by the abrupt amnesty. The writing style enriches the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The scale's whisper of immortality is nuanced, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. The atmosphere feels authentically crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the immortality theme could be tighter. The brief length works, leaving a lingering question about sacrifice.</comment>
