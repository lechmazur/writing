<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleni's timid yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation (fulfilling a childhood promise) is clear and deeply integrated into her actions. Her use of the typewriter ribbon as a symbolic tool reveals her emotional depth and resourcefulness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Eleni's consultation of the scoreboard driving the narrative forward logically. The cause-and-effect chain is clear, and the story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the transition to the temple could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Greek temple and the shuttered arcade form a haunting, evocative setting that enhances the story's themes of decay and renewal. Sensory details (dust motes, flickering bulbs) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craftsmanship, with rich symbolism (the ribbon as a rosary, the scoreboard as a quilt of memories) and a deeply resonant ending. The theme of collective healing is explored with nuance and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and tropes, offering fresh metaphors (e.g., "skeletal threads") and a unique perspective on industrial decline. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtext and atmosphere rather than stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the narrative. The brevity is a strength, leaving the reader with a lingering sense of hope and interconnectedness.</comment>
