<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's dry-tongued bard persona is vividly portrayed, with his actions and inner conflict revealing depth. His motivation to escape self-doubt is clear, though his 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Elian's resolution feeling earned. The prism and voicemails drive the narrative coherently, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mushroom hall and dreamless night meld seamlessly, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Sensory details (spores, prism light) immerse deeply, elevating the setting to a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (prism, cloak) and lyrical prose evoke introspection. The theme of self-liberation resonates, though the climax's static bloom feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and arresting, with fresh metaphors ("wine spilt on gravel"). Only minor over-formality in phrasing ("paried to bone") hints at AI tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The brevity serves the theme, and the prismâ€™s role feels inventive. Lingers like spores in moonlight.</comment>
