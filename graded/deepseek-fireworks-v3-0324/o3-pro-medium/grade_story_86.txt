<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys Fletch's apprehension and archer skills are integrated well, but her motivation could be more deeply explored. The candle's symbolism adds depth to her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause and effect, though the hot air balloon festival feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cyberpunk setting and "borrowed dawn" tone are masterfully evoked. Sensory details (neon, coolant mist) immerse the reader without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance with cycles of compassion and truth. Literary devices (metaphors like "chrome jackals") enhance impact. Ending is purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about truth’s fragility.</comment>
