<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentient houseplant, Chlor, is vividly realized with a distinct voice and motivation, though the protagonist's inner conflict could be more sharply defined to match the plant's complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with cause-and-effect logic intact, though the "outrunning dawn" motif could be slightly more grounded in the story's internal rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in and neon-faded neighborhood are richly atmospheric, with sensory details that elevate the surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and subtext, with an ending that lingers. The dialogue (Chlor's lines) is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—avoids clichés and formulaic prose. The "apathetically devoted" houseplant and embroidered bookmark are fresh narrative devices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette where every element serves the theme of unspoken truths. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
