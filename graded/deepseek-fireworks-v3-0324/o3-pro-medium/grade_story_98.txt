<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fainthearted sentinel's motivation is clear and compelling, though his internal conflict could be slightly deeper to amplify tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is tight and logical, with skillful cause-and-effect threading. The climax feels earned but slightly abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionally vivid, with sensory details (rain, candle smoke) enriching the eerie, secretive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic layering (companionship vs. isolation, illusion vs. competence) and impactful symbolism (ruler, tapestry). The ending resonates but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, though the "illusion of security" motif leans slightly generic. The ruler-as-key concept is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate; elements enhance rather than constrain. Leaves a haunting aftertaste of transformation.</comment>
