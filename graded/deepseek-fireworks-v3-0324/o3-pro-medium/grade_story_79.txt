<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the chain and rebel action driving a logical, impactful arc. Pacing is excellent, but the library's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are luminous—constellations, dust, and shattered glass create a haunting, immersive mood. The midday lull enhances the ethereal tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The chain and stars elevate the story beyond its length, leaving a lingering, luminous question.</comment>
