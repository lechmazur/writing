<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rauan's motivation is clear and nuanced, his trembling hands and past as an artist adding depth. However, his transition from mercenary to seeker of peace could be more explicitly developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the amber spider serving as a compelling focal point. Pacing is excellent, though the bargain with the muralist feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cathedral's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (aerosol ghosts, kaleidoscopic wounds) elevating the setting. The connection between object and setting is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as ledger, stained glass as wounds) and lyrical prose create lasting impact. The ending is poignant, though the muralist's role could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors ("twilight dripped like candle wax") are fresh, and the emotional resonance is subtle yet powerful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. The elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
