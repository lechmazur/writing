<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wren's whimsy and tinkering are vividly portrayed, and his motivation to chronicle environmental changes through art is clear and compelling. His reaction to the palace's impending collapse reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Wren's final diorama serving as a poignant resolution. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect chain (geothermal decline → palace collapse) is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace and its crystalline anchors are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (cracking stalactites, moonlit frost) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting enhances the theme of impermanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (e.g., "time bent like soft wire"), the story balances thermodynamic honesty with poetic metaphor. The ending is hauntingly purposeful, and the theme of mortality resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of whimsy and doom feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple excess while remaining vivid ("filigree pillars of sigh-vapor").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. Every element serves the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader contemplating mortality through Wren's "practical illusion."</comment>
