<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Corva's motivation is clear and compelling, with her restless curiosity and professional facade revealing depth. Her actions align with her role, though her internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the amber earrings and time loops, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the carnival scene could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is vividly realized with poetic sensory details (rippling rainbows, smudged chalk skies). The sky reflection pool and carnival orbit are brilliantly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("velvet scalpel," "condemned comet's trajectory") and layered themes of desire vs. freedom elevate the prose. The ending lingers, though the emotional punch could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh twists on time travel and femme fatale tropes. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("cautious impulsiveness" feels slightly overworked).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, though the thematic weight could be more fully explored.</comment>
