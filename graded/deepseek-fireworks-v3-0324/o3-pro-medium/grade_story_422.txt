<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celia's selectively mute ventriloquism is vividly rendered, and her optimism contrasts sharply with Pepper's sarcasm, creating a dynamic voice. However, her motivation to archive weather patterns feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with Celia's eavesdropping and ventriloquism driving the narrative forward. The ending’s thematic shift is earned but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is evoked with rich sensory detail, though its "parallel" nature isn’t fully exploited. The stormy, untuned-cello atmosphere is masterfully sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (sky-tears, foam signatures) and subtext (family as shared forecasts). The ending lingers with poetic force, though the euphoric agitation could be more grounded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and premise, with fresh imagery. A few phrases verge on overwrought ("bruised the sand"), but the emotional core feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The elements cohere beautifully, and the brevity feels deliberate. Only the parallel universe aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
