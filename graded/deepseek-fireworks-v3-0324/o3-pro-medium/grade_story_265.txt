<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mariel's impassive demeanor is well-contrasted with her private moment of grace, revealing depth. Her actions align with her motivation, but further nuance in her internal conflict could elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the oil changes framing the mystical encounter. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the bees' language could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard in the cathedral is vividly rendered, blending decay and vitality. Sensory details (smell, sound) immerse the reader, though tactile descriptions are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (blossom, twist tie) and lyrical prose create a haunting impact. The ending resonates, though the bees' language slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though the "secret language of bees" edges toward whimsy. Nuanced emotion through action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering awe. Only minor tightening of the mystical elements would perfect it.</comment>
