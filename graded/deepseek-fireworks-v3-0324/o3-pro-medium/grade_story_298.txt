<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chameleon stage actor's motivations are clear and compelling, blending performance with personal revelation. Their actions align with their "rationally impulsive" nature, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the cold-case mystery driving the narrative logically to its resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the leap to reproduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with solar mirrors and paper gears, and the palace's decay contrasts beautifully with its reimagined purpose. Sensory details (e.g., stains like chrysanthemums) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (light, the doll dress) and subtext (truth vs. illusion). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of merging inquiry with performance is resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The chameleon actor and Princess Zhao’s fate feel fresh. Language is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond its brief length.</comment>
