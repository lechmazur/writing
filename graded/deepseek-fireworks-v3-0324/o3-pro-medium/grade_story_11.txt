<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation and personality are vividly drawn, with her "serene anger" and cartographic focus revealing depth. Her use of the overalls patch aligns perfectly with her mentor's legacy, though her "flighty" nature could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Mira's linearization of the fresco driving the narrative logically toward resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the initiation's stakes could be slightly clearer earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with stained-glass moonlight and muralled walls enhancing the secret society's mystique. Sensory details (grease-stained patch, trembling candles) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (patch as covenant, starlight atlases) and layered themes (art vs. machinery, legacy) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "flicker of unity" could resonate more viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresco-as-map conceit, though "strangely normal" feels slightly forced. The prose is precise without being purple, and Miraâ€™s nuanced emotions avoid AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, elegant story where elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the "pulsing" continental silhouette.</comment>
