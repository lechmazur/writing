<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Solun's boredom and shapeshifting abilities are vividly portrayed, with his restlessness driving the plot. His motivation to "shift the cosmic balance" is clear and aligned with his talents, though his "intelligently foolish" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the taxi ride and cave scene logically advancing the rebellion arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the storm's abrupt cessation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and post-empire setting are masterfully integrated, with sensory details (crystals chiming, sapphire shadows) amplifying the atmosphere. The figurine's connection to the caves is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (figurine, storm) and layered themes (upheaval, resonance) elevate the storytelling. The ending is satisfying, though Solun's glee could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("thunder boomed like tuning drums") and no clichés. Solun's nuanced restlessness and the cave's sentient quality stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the figurine and caves feel indispensable. The brevity serves the tale’s mischief, leaving a lingering question: what thrones will Solun topple next?</comment>
