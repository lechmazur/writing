<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thatchmouth's fervent apathy and steadfast oath are compellingly rendered, though his straw-hearted defiance feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot arcs elegantly from oath-bound stagnation to renewal, though the virtual reality shift risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fossilized giant and dust seas create a haunting, immersive atmosphere; "realistically fantastical" details excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (moths as static, fan as blade) and layered themes of legacy elevate the prose. Minor pacing hiccups.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Startlingly original voice and fresh metaphors ("oxymoron blossoming") avoid clich√©. Only the visor's mechanics feel slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense vignette that lingers. The brevity serves its existential weight.</comment>
