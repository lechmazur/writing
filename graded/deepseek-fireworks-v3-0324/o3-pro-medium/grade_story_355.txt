<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's aloofness and dancer's grace are well-integrated, her motivation to free unspoken truths via movement is clear, but her backstory (letters) feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from party's end to revelation, with tight cause-effect logic; pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger a beat longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Psychedelic installation is vividly immersive, with neon mandalas and confetti as perfect foils to Mara's solitude; sensory details (blacklight ink, slick palms) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (compass as erratic guide, murals as cage/sky) and subtext (performance vs. truth); ending is haunting yet purposeful, though the "footprints" metaphor verges on overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés; "harshly compassionate" heartbeat metaphor and glitter-infused ink feel fresh. Minor overuse of "pirouette" motifs slightly dampens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the compass and letters enrich theme without feeling forced. Dawn's "encore" leaves resonant ambiguity—brief length feels intentional.</comment>
