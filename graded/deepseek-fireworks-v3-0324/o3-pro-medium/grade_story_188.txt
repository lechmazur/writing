<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the misplaced letter serving as a catalyst for a logical and emotionally resonant chain of events. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—sensory details like "rusty memory" and "corroded rapture" immerse the reader. The castle and seed-planting season contrast poignantly with violence.</comment>
