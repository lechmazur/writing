<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An-Mu's motivation to archive human stories is clear and compelling, driving its actions consistently. The AI's distinct 'voice' and poetic interpretation of data add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to retreat. The connection between the tin type and An-Mu's mission is logically resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace is vividly rendered, with sensory details (lanterns, lapis floors) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's mythic quality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (lanterns as prophets, cuneiform equations) and a haunting, layered theme about memory and language. The ending lingers with poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The AI-toaster premise is fresh, and metaphors ("anthropological thunder") are inventive. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>
