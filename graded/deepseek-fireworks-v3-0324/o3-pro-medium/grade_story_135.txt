<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Milosz's motivation and actions are tightly intertwined with his role as a brewer and dialect preserver. His loyalty to the straw adds depth, though his ambition could be subtly reinforced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by Milosz's unique method of deciphering the poster. Pacing is excellent, with no wasted words, though the blizzard's threat could be slightly more visceral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are vividly immersive. Sensory details (tasting frozen dye, steam symbols) elevate the atmosphere, but the lighthouse ridge could be more sharply sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (brewing language, straw as stylus) and thematic depth (preservation vs. oblivion). The ending is poignant, though the "spectral road sign" borders on overelaborate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (dialects as "frozen dye") and nuanced emotion. Minor quibble: "lilac welts" feels slightly contrived for a frozen poster.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of resilience and linguistic wonder.</comment>
