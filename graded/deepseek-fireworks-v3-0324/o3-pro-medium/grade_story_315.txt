<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark's motivations are vivid and his transformation is compelling, though some actions feel slightly exaggerated for the sake of the premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear cause-and-effect chain, though the quantum mechanics logic might confuse some readers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, striking story that balances whimsy and depth. The jar lidâ€™s role as emotional anchor is particularly masterful.</comment>
