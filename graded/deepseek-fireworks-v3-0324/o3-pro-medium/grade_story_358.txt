<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Graythorn’s motivation is clear and intriguing, blending whimsy and hidden intent. Naya’s childlike curiosity contrasts well with his calculated aimlessness, but her depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with mirror reflections and the riddle driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition through the glass feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse is vividly realized, blending sci-fi and fantasy seamlessly. Sensory details (bioluminescent moss, auroral mist) elevate the atmosphere, making the setting integral to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirrors, hieroglyphs) and lyrical prose create layers of meaning. The ending is satisfying yet open, and the theme of play as exploration resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "cuddle" action and "sanctified dread" tone are fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the brief length feeling intentional. The story lingers in the mind, balancing whimsy and mysticism masterfully.</comment>
