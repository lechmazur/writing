<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avery's dual role as elevator technician and ghost-seer is compelling, with his motivation to "dissect" his tether to the supernatural clearly driving his actions. His "elegantly clumsy" nature reflects in both his physicality and emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot tightly weaves Avery's staking out of ghost tours with his climax of breaking and rebuilding the sand castle, creating a clear arc of tension and release. The pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lab's "salt and ancient seashell resin" juxtaposed with the "dissonance of silence" creates an immersive, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details ("sand hissed," "brine and dust") deepen the ghostly tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (elevator cables as grief strands, sand as fragility), subtext about liberation, and a resonant ending elevate this beyond surface narrative. The "missing notes" metaphor is particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("silence rang like off-key bells"), nuanced emotion (Avery's trembling hand betraying his calm facade), and an original premise avoid clich√©s. The prose is deliberate, not ornamental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the theme of release. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question: Is Avery truly alone, or just finally listening to himself? A cohesive, polished gem.</comment>
