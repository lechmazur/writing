<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Peregrine Voss is well-defined with a distinct voice and consistent motivation, though his "warmly aloof" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-effect logic, though the brevity slightly rushes the resolution of the spacetime crevice.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold's atmosphere is richly immersive, blending decay and cosmic wonder, though the "gentle harshness" tone could be more pronounced in sensory details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, and the length feels deliberate, yet the dial tone motif slightly overpowers the quieter, more original themes.</comment>
