<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's rebellious yet introspective nature is vividly portrayed, with her "sadly joyful" paradox and motivation to awaken her "stagnant heart" lending depth. Her reliance on the pocket knife and adaptation syllabus aligns seamlessly with her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Mara's quest for connection and signal driving the narrative. The haunted house's transformation and hotpot finale create a cohesive arc. Pacing is brisk yet immersive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is richly atmospheric, with decaying gables, spectral murals, and boiling chili oil heightening the eerie yet whimsical tone. Sensory details (ozone, sugar floss) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose ("ephemeral gloom," "patched denim") and potent symbolism (the knife as adaptation, hotpot as communion) elevate the story. The ending—revived curiosity—resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("adaptation itself, the unseen chef") and subversion of tropes (haunted house as catalyst for warmth) showcase originality. Nuanced emotions avoid cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the narrative; the fusion of rebellion, culinary love, and spectral whimsy feels organic. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving a lingering taste of wonder.</comment>
