<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's insomnia and poetic nature are vividly portrayed, driving their actions and introspection. Their motivation to seek silence and transform violence into gentleness is subtle but compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly, propelled by the encounter with the woman and the attic's revelations. The resolution—gifting the box—feels organic and resonant, given the tight word count.</comment>
