<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sura's dual nature as a bookish assassin is compelling, and her internal conflict is clear. However, her sudden shift to revolutionary feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc. The pacing is excellent, though the meditation sequence slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The station's isolation enhances tension and mirrors Sura's dilemma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors elevate it. Only minor stiffness in Sura's introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about guardianship vs. control.</comment>
