<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tomas's layered motivation (personal grief, family secrets) and distinct voice are compelling, though his transition from woodsman to cartographer could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect logic is strong, and pacing manages the word limit well, but the radio wave garden's relevance to the climax feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with vivid sensory details (static-coated gravel, dripping stairs), though the garden's "antenna-petal rows" verge on over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (hairbrush as lie/map) and subtext; the ending's emotional payoff is rare for such brevity. Only a hint of melodrama in the lightning surge.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original take on grief and dishonesty, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "forest of estrangement"). Minimal AI tells; only the "vertebrae of extinct locomotives" feels slightly overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly, though the garden's role could be sharper. Lingering resonance elevates it beyond constraints.</comment>
