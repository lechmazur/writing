<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clandestine watchman's motivation is clear and consistent, with his analytical freedom and wilderness wisdom shaping his actions. His distinct 'voice' emerges through precise, evocative actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc and logical cause-effect relationships. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful, though slightly abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay and post-performance timeframe create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (sparks, rust, braille-like bumps) are vividly deployed to enhance mood and action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (prismatic corridors, braille-as-code) elevate the subtext. The theme of defying finality is explored with originality, and the ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
