<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gleam’s "tuneless bard" persona and fiercely nonchalant attitude are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "kiss the horizon of madness" feels slightly abstract, leaving room for deeper emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the stained manuscript and tinderbox driving the action. The ending resolves coherently, though the middle could slightly sharpen cause-and-effect transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding: the steampunk airship's atmosphere, greasy portholes, and drunken-propeller imagery create immersive sensory details that enhance the chaos-taming theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft (metaphors like "ink rearranged bones"), thematic depth ("teaching chaos to waltz"), and a memorable voice. Minor pacing quibbles near the midpoint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original—subverts bard tropes, avoids clichés, and wields fresh imagery ("sparks like renegade commas"). Nuanced emotion and style elevate it beyond formulaic prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly; the story thrives within its constraints. Leaves a lingering taste of "iron and uncertainty," proving deliberate brevity.</comment>
