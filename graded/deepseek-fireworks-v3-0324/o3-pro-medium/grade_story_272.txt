<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elliot's socially awkward inventor persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His actions align well with his traits, though some nuance in emotional depth could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from regret to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the encrypted archive twist slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with diner and oak motifs weaving seamlessly into theme and character. Sensory details (neon, coffee steam) enhance mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (oak as regret, whistle as code) and subtext. Ending is satisfying, and the theme of rewriting past loops resonates deeply. Style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "compass freed from magnets") and nuanced emotion. No AI-generic phrasing or tonal inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. Lingers in the mind—especially the oak/regret symbolism—and feels deliberate, not constrained by length.</comment>
