<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel’s motivation is clear and his actions align well with his cryptologist background. The hive-mind therapist adds depth, but some character nuances feel underdeveloped due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the resolution feels intentional. The word limit forces some compression, but the pacing remains effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and uniquely eerie, with vivid sensory details (candle wax, hissing wind) enhancing the tone. The setting and timeframe synergize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (charger plug, wax codes) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of memory/regret is explored with sophistication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoids clichés, and the hive-mind therapist concept is fresh. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity enhances its impact.</comment>
