<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit and obsessive motivation to learn dance through supernatural confiscation create a distinct, hauntingly original character. Their voice is sharp and consistent, though their transition from vengeance to longing could be slightly more explicit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled, with the frayed rope and ledger driving a logical yet surreal arc. Pacing is masterful—no wasted words—though the gramophone's arrival verges on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s pinnacle: the lighthouse thrums with salt, soot, and spectral rhythm. Sensory details (phosphorescent barnacles, brine-heavy coat) dissolve the boundary between setting and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Devastatingly lyrical metaphors ("promises are only stone until the tide decides") and a haunting theme of erosion elevate this beyond mere ghost story. The ending’s grace notes linger like tide marks.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional originality. The dance-as-debt premise feels wholly fresh, and the prose avoids cliché with barnacle-scratched precision. Only minor quibble: "reckless precision" slightly over-announces its tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The rope, dance, and ledger interlock like steps in a tango. Brief length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with the ache of eroded cliffs.</comment>
