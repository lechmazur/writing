<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vireo's death wish and vocation as a poison taster are vividly portrayed, with his motivation clear and his actions aligned. His 'voice' is distinct, though his revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent, though the climax’s resolution could be slightly more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean setting is lushly rendered, with sensory details (luminescent spores, obsidian sand) amplifying the eerie, transcendent atmosphere. The ice sculpture’s collapse is a standout moment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bookmark as map, venom as regret) and layered themes (metamorphosis, artistry of survival) elevate the prose. The ending is satisfying but could linger longer emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors ("braided lightning," "lucid stillness") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés and AI pitfalls, though one or two phrases verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements, leaving a haunting aftertaste. The brevity feels deliberate, with depth beyond the page.</comment>
