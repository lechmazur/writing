<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear, but his 'aimless' nature feels slightly inconsistent with his purposeful quest for the seeds. The handkerchief adds depth, revealing emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action logically leading to the next. The hopscotch-to-seeds transition is inspired, though the grill’s introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—sensory details (snow, ink, charcoal) deepen the archive’s haunting beauty. The setting feels alive and inseparable from the story’s themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: metaphors (seeds as vigilance) and symbolism (handkerchief as memory) resonate. The ending’s revelation of purpose elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "languages pinned like butterflies") and nuanced emotion ("mournful elation") distinguish the voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and profound. The elements serve a unified vision, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about memory’s role in survival.</comment>
