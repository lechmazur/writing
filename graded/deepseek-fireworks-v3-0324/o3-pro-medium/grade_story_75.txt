<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caelum's guarded nature and minstrel background are vividly portrayed, with his internal conflict and paradoxical trust issues adding depth. His "angry peace" and skepticism credulity are consistent and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action driving toward the climax. The condition of "decrypting wedding vows" is eccentric yet coherent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-forest is richly imagined, blending organic and technological details seamlessly. Sensory descriptions (humming leaves, holographic fireflies) heighten immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (bookmark, vows), poetic prose, and a haunting ending. The conflict between art and oppression is nuanced, with subtext lingering after the last line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("restrained thunder inside bark") and a unique fusion of folklore and sci-fi. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story masterfully. The length feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic weight. A standout in micro-fiction.</comment>
