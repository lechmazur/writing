<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sarik's motivations and character arc are deeply nuanced, with his past as a duelist and present quest for forgiveness expertly woven into his actions. His 'voice' and reactions are distinct and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (ozone, decayed cargo, server hum) immersing the reader. The spaceport customs office is a perfect, haunting backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the chest, foils, broth), and the ending is deeply satisfying. The theme of forgiveness is explored with layered subtext and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors (e.g., "a knife and a lullaby in the same steam") are fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, serving the story rather than feeling imposed. The brevity enhances impact, leaving a lingering, bittersweet aftertaste.</comment>
