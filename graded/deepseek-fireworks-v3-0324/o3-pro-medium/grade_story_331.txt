<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arin's reserved caretaker role is well-developed, though his "honestly dishonest" nature could be deeper. His motivation to preserve spiritual practices is clear, but his internal conflict about memory loss feels slightly under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from disturbance to resolution. The quantum entanglement mechanics are inventive yet logically woven into the action. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The quantum garden is vividly realized, with sensory details (mauve glow, fractal bats) enhancing its surreal atmosphere. The setting intensifies the story's emotional and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ledger, music box) and layered themes (memory, sacrifice). The ending is poignant and resonant, with subtle subtext about cycles and erasure. Language is precise yet evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. Metaphors (bats as "punctuation," melody "leaking") are fresh. Nuanced emotions (restraint trembling under ribs) avoid AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Creative fusion of quantum physics and spirituality stands out.</comment>
