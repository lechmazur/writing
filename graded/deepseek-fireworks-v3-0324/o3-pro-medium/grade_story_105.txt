<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Morlen's motivation is clear and compelling, anchored by his exile and obsession. His actions align with his goal of challenging tyranny, and his "strangely trustworthy" nature adds depth. However, his inner conflict could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear cause-and-effect chain driving toward resolution. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the diaries' role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly realized, with sensory details (brass tassels, rainbow static) enhancing the mystical atmosphere. The garage and corridor settings amplify the tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell as soul-mirror, frozen clocks) elevates the narrative. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of resistance through self-awareness resonates. Only minor tightening of metaphors is needed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though a few phrases border on ornate ("tar-dipped owls"). The soul-mirroring concept feels fresh, and the tone avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative tale where elements serve the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about time and power.</comment>
