<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional depth in portraying the eternal student's motivation and existential curiosity. Voice is distinct and aligns perfectly with actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, cohesive arc with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the ending’s spiral metaphor slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
