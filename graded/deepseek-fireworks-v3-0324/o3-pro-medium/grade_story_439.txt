<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mute courier's silence and his unassumingly bold demeanor create a compelling paradox. His motivation to seek hidden meanings is clear and well-integrated with his actions, though deeper introspection could enhance his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the comet's guidance and the opera house's revival forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The storm-battered opera house and falling snow create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "albino fireflies," "ultramarine chord") are masterfully evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ruins as unfinished scores) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "the mind's escape" could be more explicitly resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and free of clich√©s, though some phrases ("shimmering interpretations") verge on over-ornamentation. The cosmic/metaphysical twist feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader with a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
