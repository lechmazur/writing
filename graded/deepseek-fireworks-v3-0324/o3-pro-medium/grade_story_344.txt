<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia and curiosity are compellingly intertwined, driving her actions and transformation effectively. Her distinct voice and motivation are clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from fear to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the tea house's mechanics could be slightly more grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating tea house and misted gulf create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (steam, jam, coral reflections) enrich the world meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (claustrophobia as "meaningful geography") and subtext. The ending is resonant and thematically satisfying, with layered emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clich√©s. The jam-to-tea method and glasses-as-portals are fresh, and emotions are shown through nuanced reactions (panic ebbing "like tide withdrawn").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder and emotional spaciousness.</comment>
