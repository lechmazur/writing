<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jorlan's jovial yet reluctant nature is vividly captured, with his bravado masking deeper unease. However, his shift from coin-driven to wisdom-seeking feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each act logically progressing toward the vow's dissolution. Pacing is excellent, though the garden's reaction to the telescope leans toward whimsy over coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The garden's eerie, enchanted atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (cinnamon lightning, thorny mint) elevating the setting to a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (telescope as wisdom, laughter as defiance) and a resonant theme (dethroning doubt) make this memorable. The ending's emotional payoff is strong but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("moonlight like a loyal mutt") stand out, though the "elegant mayhem" tone occasionally veers into over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the capsule and telescope serving dual narrative and thematic roles. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering call to courage.</comment>
