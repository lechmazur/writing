<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jules is vividly rendered with a distinct personality; his aloofness and detachment are consistent, and his reactions to the supernatural reveal depth. His motivation to transform fear into courage is subtly but effectively shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the gravitational anomaly serves as a compelling driver without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garage setting and shimmering afternoon atmosphere are richly detailed, enhancing the surreal tone. Sensory details (e.g., warm stones, hum) immerse the reader, and the setting amplifies the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of stones, the lottery ticket's message) are masterfully used. The ending is purposeful and lingers, and the theme of courage vs. fear is explored with nuance and elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The handling of emotion is subtle, and the prose avoids purple-ness. The gravitational anomaly twist feels inventive, not algorithmic.</comment>
