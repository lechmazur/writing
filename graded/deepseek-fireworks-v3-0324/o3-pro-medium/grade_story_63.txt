<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mari's reserved yet driven nature is vividly portrayed; her motivation to preserve art is clear and deeply personal, reinforced by her grandmother's legacy. Her actions align seamlessly with her traits, though a tad more nuance in her internal conflict could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with Mari's mending of the lullaby driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels both complete and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's auditory atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (reeds squeaking, vials settling) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the story's core themes of preservation and resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors (cuffs like "soft semaphore"), layered symbolism (waves, stitching), and a hauntingly evocative ending. The story lingers in the mind, blending emotional depth with lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of oracle, sound-mending, and embroidery feels fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., "humbly proud yet trembling") avoid AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with each serving the story's thematic heartbeat. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant, thought-provoking impact.</comment>
