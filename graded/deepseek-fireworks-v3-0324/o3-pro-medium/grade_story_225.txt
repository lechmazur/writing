<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas and Aurelia's motivations are clear and consistent, with their chemistry and shared purpose driving the narrative. Their "voices" are distinct through Morse code and actions, though Aurelia's backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the dry highlighter and Morse code serving as clever catalysts. Pacing is impeccable, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—steampunk submarine aesthetics, radium butterflies, and coral-blood ink create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hissing steam, phosphorescent wings) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (butterflies as geopolitical omens) and subtext (love as sabotage). The ending's emotional resonance and thematic depth ("binding clause") linger beyond the last line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("gears gnashing like old sea beasts") and a surprising twist on love and neutrality defy tropes. Only minor quibbles: "unjustly fair" feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Every element serves the story’s heart—empathy amid conflict. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting waltz of ideas.</comment>
