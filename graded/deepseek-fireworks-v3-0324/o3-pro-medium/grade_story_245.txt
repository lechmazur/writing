<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Varek Pell's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions with a blend of grief and defiance. His 'voice' is distinct, though some nuances of his irate nature could be further sharpened.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly wound, with every action serving the narrative. The tea-leaf prophecy and subsequent flight are coherent and compelling, though the ration retrieval feels slightly expedited.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered, with dust and rust amplifying Varek's isolation. Sensory details (e.g., fogged drone lenses, flaking rust) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tea leaves as maps, chopstick as cudgel) elevates the prose. The ending’s blend of hope and grit lingers, though the theme of revolt could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh—no clichés, and metaphors (e.g., "profit like a bruise") are striking. Minor quibble: "blistering hope" edges toward familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a potent whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for resonance. A standout balance of cohesion and ambition.</comment>
