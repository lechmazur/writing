<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perrin's character is vividly drawn, with layered motivations and a distinct voice. His defense mechanisms and yearning for affection are skillfully shown through actions like kicking the nest and mocking himself. His growth feels organic, though some of his internal conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc. The tight word limit is used efficiently, though the transition to the sanctuary asteroid could be slightly smoother. The prank-on-self twist is inventive and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is a stunning, immersive setting that enhances the story's mood and themes. Sensory details (glittering plums, trembling peaches) are evocative, and the contrast between the ship's vastness and Perrin's intimacy with the phone is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craftsmanship, with rich symbolism (the nest, the statues), layered subtext, and a deeply satisfying ending. The theme of self-acceptance is explored with originality and emotional weight. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original, avoiding clich√©s and formulaic writing. The blending of sci-fi and introspection feels fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "kissing a mirror that keeps insulting your haircut") are inventive. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, compelling story where every element serves the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. The interplay of setting, character, and theme demonstrates exceptional creative thinking.</comment>
