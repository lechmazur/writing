<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carys Ironstride’s no-nonsense empathy and blacksmith heritage are vividly integrated, driving her actions and interactions with the supernatural. Her heartbeat motif is a brilliant touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Carys’ mission and the dollhouse’s awakening culminating in a resonant climax. Pacing is expert, though the word limit slightly truncates the final payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is immersive, with exquisite sensory details (groaning corridors, molten glass) that heighten the melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (bell-founders’ creed, fused glass) and subtext about tradition as a living force. The ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("lungs syncing like a heartbeat"), nuanced emotion, and a distinct voice avoid cliché. Only minor over-reliance on "steely" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with creative synergy between theme, character, and setting. Leaves the reader haunted by its quiet defiance of extinction.</comment>
