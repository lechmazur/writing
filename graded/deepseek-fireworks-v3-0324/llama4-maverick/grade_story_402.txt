<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The baron's motivation is clear but his survivalist background feels underutilized. His actions align with archiving, but his "off-grid" nature lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of fleeting completeness, though the raft's symbolic pull could be more tightly woven into the baron's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with vivid sensory details, though the "luminous doubt" occasionally overpowers the macabre setting's grounded eeriness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong literary craft and subtext, but the ending's ambiguity leans slightly toward vagueness rather than purposeful open-endedness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "off-grid baron" concept borders on contrivance. Language avoids purple prose but occasionally over-relies on ethereal descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering unease, though the raft's symbolic weight feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
