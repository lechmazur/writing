<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's phobia and stunt double background are intriguing but underdeveloped. Their motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" feels somewhat abstract, though the resolution of overcoming fears is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed, with the garage sale setup feeling abrupt. The map-to-library transition works, but the net's significance could be clearer. Pacing is uneven due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—sensory details like "aged parchment" and "flickering candles" immerse the reader. The pyramid library is evocative, though its connection to the net is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (net as fears) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The theme of conquering phobias is clear but slightly heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middling—the premise is fresh, but execution leans on tropes (hidden library, cryptic map). Some phrases feel generic ("shiver down my spine"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the garage sale and pyramid feel disjointed. The net's role is creative, though the story's brevity limits its impact. Leaves a faint lingering thought.</comment>
