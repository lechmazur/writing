<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear but their "nondescript" nature limits depth. Their analytical innovation is well-utilized, but their voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the rain-as-key method feels contrived. The relic's reveal is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”sensory details (rain, decay) are vivid and immersive. The tower and timeframe enhance the eerie mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of rain) are present but heavy-handed. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional resonance. Theme of justice is stated, not explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (mythic relic, cryptic clues). The rain method feels forced. Prose is polished but lacks human nuance in emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some feel grafted (surprise party timeframe). The story's brevity works, though depth is sacrificed for plot mechanics.</comment>
