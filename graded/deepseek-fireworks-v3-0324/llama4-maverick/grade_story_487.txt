<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bruiser's disturbingly calm demeanor and fierce intensity are compelling, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the twist, though the drum solo as a recurring motif slightly disrupts pacing. The resolution ties back neatly to the beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth and man-eating plants create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (scent, sound) enhance the eerie tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baton, map) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The myth-making theme lingers, though the language barrier subplot feels underdeveloped.</comment>
