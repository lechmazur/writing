<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pilot's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "careless" trait feels underdeveloped. His connection to the glove and postcards adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is strong, though the postcard investigation could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the eerie, dreamlike atmosphere. The orchard labyrinth and rain are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (glove, postcards) enrich the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of borrowed memories could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (enchanted grove, sinister doodles). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though some themes are underdeveloped.</comment>
