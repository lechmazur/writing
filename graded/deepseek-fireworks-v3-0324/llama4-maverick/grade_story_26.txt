<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inventor's sleep-deprived state and singularly plural vision are compelling but could be deeper. Their motivation to uncover hidden patterns is clear, but their emotional arc (shame/guilt) feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the DNA sequence and bell tolling driving the narrative. The resolution is satisfying, though the cyberpunk underworld's role in the arc is vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk setting are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (holographic trees, radio static). The atmosphere enhances the inventor's isolation and urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bell, DNA) and evocative prose elevate the story. The theme of liberation from shame is poignant, though the "new era" climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original cyberpunk-meets-biotech premise, but some phrases ("singularly plural vision") verge on overwrought. Emotional nuance is shown more than told, avoiding AI clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling intentional. The ending lingers, though the cyberpunk underworld's stakes could be sharper.</comment>
