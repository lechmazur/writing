<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; the "loyal wanderer" archetype is well-utilized, though deeper introspection could strengthen their voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with a clear arc, but the dance class encounter feels slightly contrived as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's dreamlike atmosphere, though its connection to the dance class is tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the dance class element feels less integrated than others.</comment>
