<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The duelist's motivation is clear and their obsession with culinary experiments as a path to forgiveness is compelling, though their "cheerless" nature could be more vividly contrasted with their evolving mindset.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between dueling and cooking feels slightly forced, and the pacing could better emphasize the duelist's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and server hum create a rich, evocative atmosphere, though the maggoty chest's decay could be more viscerally tied to the duelist's internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a satisfying ending, though some metaphors (e.g., "elasticizing perspective") verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("weight of past mistakes"). The culinary twist is fresh, but the duelist's voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, though the spaceport setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, but a sharper climax would elevate it further.</comment>
