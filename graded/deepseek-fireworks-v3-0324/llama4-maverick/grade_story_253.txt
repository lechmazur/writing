<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bandit's motivation is clear but their "eloquently silent" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their vulnerability adds depth, but the "polite" aspect is barely explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The harp's discordant notes feel slightly forced as a guiding method, but the chip's significance drives the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "electronic wilderness refuge" is intriguing but underutilized. The classroom setting contrasts well with the sci-fi elements, though sensory details are sparse beyond sound.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chip, harp) and subtext (time as currency). The ending is purposeful, though the "proud humility" tone occasionally clashes with the high-stakes premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (time manipulation, lone thief). The prose avoids clich√©s but sometimes overreaches for poetic effect ("electronic wilderness refuge").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the harp's role slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
