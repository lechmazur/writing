<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "urban hermit" aspect feels underdeveloped. The broken zipper pull symbolism is effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in connecting folklore analysis to the nebula setting. Pacing suffers slightly from word limit constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details, but the nebula deck feels disconnected from the folklore theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the theme is clear, but the ending lacks deeper resonance. Subtext is present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (rebel against conformity). Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but elements like the nebula deck feel imposed. Length suits the introspective tone, though depth is sacrificed.</comment>
