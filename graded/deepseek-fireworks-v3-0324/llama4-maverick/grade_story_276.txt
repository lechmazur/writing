<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emissary's motivation is clear but their unease feels underdeveloped. The coathanger as a symbol is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between debris tracking and redemption feels tenuous. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orbital setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the picnics timeframe feels oddly juxtaposed. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has subtext and literary devices (e.g., the coathanger as symbol), but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrasing feels formulaic. The emissary's voice lacks distinctiveness. Avoids clich√©s but could push further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. Leaves a lingering thought but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
