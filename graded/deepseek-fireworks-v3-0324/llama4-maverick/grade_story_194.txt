<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lumberjack's motivation is clear but his "spirited" nature feels underdeveloped. His reactions to the coded letter and ossuary reveal depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the coded letter's introduction feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the connection between healing traditions and war agendas could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-restaurant setting is vividly atmospheric and enhances the theme. Sensory details (creaking sign, flickering candles) are evocative, but the bike rides lack texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (ossuary as transformation) and subtext, but the ending's "brighter future" feels unearned. Conflict (inner demons vs. healing) is compelling but resolved too neatly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("harsh tenderness") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, yet the lumberjack's logic lacks human unpredictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ossuary metaphor lingers, though the coded letter's impact is under-explored.</comment>
