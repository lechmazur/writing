<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brewer's motivation is clear and aligns with his values, but his "uniquely generic" attribute feels underdeveloped and lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the protest and the mansion feels tenuous. Pacing is uneven, with some rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the haunted mansion graveyard setting feels slightly clich√©d.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror, darkness) is effective, but the ending's resolution lacks emotional punch. Theme of values is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (haunted mansion, darkness). Some phrases feel overly formal or flowery without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story feels constrained by its length. The brewer's arc is compelling but could be richer.</comment>
