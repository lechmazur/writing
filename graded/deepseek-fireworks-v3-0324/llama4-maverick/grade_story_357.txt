<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with the black rose serving as a strong symbolic anchor. However, the "seldom odd" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the sudden party invitation feels contrived. The game-night structure works, though the frost giant's lair setting doesn't fully integrate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven; the lair's icy details clash with the warmth of a party. The black rose's glow is a standout moment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, particularly in the triumph over despair. Ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh handling of solitude vs. community. Minor AI-like phrasing ("earnest flippancy") but overall avoids tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the lair and party feel forced. The black rose and despair motif elevate the narrative beyond its constraints.</comment>
