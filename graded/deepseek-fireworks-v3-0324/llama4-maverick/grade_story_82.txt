<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear but their "analytically playful" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their grip on the tooth is a strong visual, but their personality lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the tooth's mystery, though the futuristic hub feels underutilized. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard's cursed atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "futuristic hub" clashes tonally. Sensory details (e.g., pulsating tooth, decaying structures) are standout strengths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tooth as key) and evocative prose, but the "gleeful sorrow" tone wobbles. Ending hints at depth but doesn't fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("gleeful sorrow," "voice of the unknown") verge on clich√©. The futuristic hub feels tacked on, disrupting authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the hub and sunrise timeframe feel forced. The story's brevity works, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
