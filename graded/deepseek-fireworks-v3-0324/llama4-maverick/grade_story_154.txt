<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier's motivation is clear but their personality lacks depth. The "strongly weak" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed. The levitation of the ink pot is a strong driver, but some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, blending ancient and modern elements effectively. Atmosphere enhances the story's mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink pot, strands of courage) is strong, but emotional impact is uneven. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some clich√©d phrasing ("whispers of urban legends"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. Leaves a lingering, though not profound, impression.</comment>
