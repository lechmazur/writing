<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with inner strength forged in the desert and tempered by the monastery. The carousel restoration reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the tapestry-to-carousel transition feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alpine monastery and desert contrasts are evocative. Sensory details (frayed tapestry, rusted carousel) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry as turmoil, carousel as renewal). Ending is satisfying, though theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but "nostalgic innovation" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s but lacks subversive depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on renewal.</comment>
