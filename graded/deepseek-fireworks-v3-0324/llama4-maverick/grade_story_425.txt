<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The paladin's moroseness and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The astronomer's fervor adds depth, but their dynamic could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The blackout and needle discovery drive the story effectively, though the resolution leans slightly toward convenience.</comment>
