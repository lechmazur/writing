<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear but somewhat underdeveloped; his "strategically spontaneous" nature feels more told than shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on atmospheric vagueness over tight cause-and-effect logic. The ending resolves cleanly but lacks deeper stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”evocative fog and celestial imagery create a haunting mood, though the setting's rules remain ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pen, fog) and mood, but the thematic depth is hinted at rather than fully realized. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in tone but relies on familiar tropes (mysterious minstrel, enchanted crowd). Some phrases verge on purple prose ("tapestry of fate").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere stylistically, but the story feels more like a vignette than a fully explored narrative. The word limit is used deftly but not transcendently.</comment>
