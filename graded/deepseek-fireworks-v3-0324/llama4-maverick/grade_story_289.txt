<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; their "brainy observer" trait is underdeveloped beyond surface-level quirks.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks tension and logical progression; the doll's significance feels tacked on rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel assembled rather than organically fused; the storyâ€™s brevity exposes its conceptual gaps.</comment>
