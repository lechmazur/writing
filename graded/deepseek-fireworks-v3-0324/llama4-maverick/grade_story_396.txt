<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forager's forgetfulness and motivation are clear but lack deeper exploration. Their actions align with their traits, but the 'voice' feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the science fair's sudden appearance feels contrived. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault and stained-glass fragment create a vivid atmosphere, though the science fair's integration is weak. Sensory details are effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans too heavily on assigned elements. The length feels deliberate, but depth is superficial.</comment>
