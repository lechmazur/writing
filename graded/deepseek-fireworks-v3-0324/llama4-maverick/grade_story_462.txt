<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration; their "town-weary" nature could be more vividly integrated into their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, though the "cradle of sparks" concept feels slightly underdeveloped in driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—sensory details and decay are evocatively rendered, enhancing mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the ending's revelation lacks the punch to fully satisfy. Subtext is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional clichés ("haunting beauty," "heart begin to heal"). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story's brevity limits thematic depth. The style supports clarity, though some moments verge on purple prose.</comment>
