<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bard's hesitation and connection to the dinosaur plush reveal depth, but her motivation to "unravel sorrow" feels slightly abstract without deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot's dream-hopping structure is coherent and purposeful, though the resolution of "healing" could be more concretely shown rather than implied.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and dreamscape are vividly atmospheric, but the "forgotten year" timeframe lacks specificity to fully ground the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (plush, tapestry) and evocative prose, but the emotional impact is slightly diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts like "collective unconscious."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans into familiar tropes (dream exploration, time's fragility). The "shyly loud" trait feels underutilized, and some phrasing borders on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity limits thematic exploration. The ending lingers, though it risks feeling more aspirational than earned.</comment>
