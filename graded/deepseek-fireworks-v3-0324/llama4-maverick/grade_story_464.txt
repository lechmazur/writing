<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sassy cook's motivation is clear and her academically mischievous nature drives her actions well, but her "drifting arrogance" could be more consistently woven into her dialogue or internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the polaroid camera and treasure chests serving as effective catalysts. Pacing is strong, though the transition from discovery to chaos could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reality calibration office and twilight setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (whispers, creaking chests) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (camera as revelation) and subtext (madness vs. order). The ending lingers, though the cook's laughter could be more unnerving to match the tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cook's voice is distinct, though some phrases ("academically mischievous") verge on over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a haunting question: What happens after the cook vanishes?</comment>
