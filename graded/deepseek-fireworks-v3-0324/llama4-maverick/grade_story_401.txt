<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "guiltily innocent" attribute feels underdeveloped. The metal ring and blanket method align well with her quest for redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the sunken ship and the blanket feels tenuous. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom is vividly atmospheric, but the "morning coffee" ritual clashes tonally. Sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (the ring, blanket) is effective, but the theme of reconciliation lacks depth. The ending is purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (redemption quest, hidden messages). Some phrases feel overly flowery or generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story leans too heavily on them. The length feels deliberate, though the premise strains believability.</comment>
