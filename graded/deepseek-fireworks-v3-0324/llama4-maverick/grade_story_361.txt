<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The trapper's motivation is clear but his "mild-mannered" nature feels underdeveloped. The dice connection is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the schoolhouse method feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the ending hints at unresolved potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic diner is vividly rendered, but the schoolhouse lacks equal sensory detail. Atmosphere supports the tone well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, equations) is strong, but emotional resonance is muted. Theme of preservation is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept, but execution leans on familiar tropes (mystical guardian, "brink of change"). Some phrasing feels algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the diner/schoolhouse dichotomy feels strained. Storyâ€™s brevity works, though depth is sacrificed.</comment>
