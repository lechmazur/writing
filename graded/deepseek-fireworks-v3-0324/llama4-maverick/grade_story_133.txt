<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jack's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "delightfully menacing" aura feels underdeveloped. Sophia's introduction adds depth, but their dynamic could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on convenience (pottery class as a cover). Pacing is tight, but the throne's significance lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, though the "labyrinth orchard" feels underutilized. Sensory details enhance mood but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, throne) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending hints at depth but doesn't fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong in concept but falters in execution (e.g., predictable tropes). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its length, though the premise is intriguing.</comment>
