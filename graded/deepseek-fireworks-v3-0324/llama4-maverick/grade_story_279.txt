<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'tactically reckless' attribute feels underdeveloped. The bent paperclip reveals subtle depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method of comparing footage is inventive but slightly abrupt in execution.</comment>
