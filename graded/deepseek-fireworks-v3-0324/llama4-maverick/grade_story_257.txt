<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "overqualified" status feels underdeveloped. Her dreamy intellect and connection to the chalkboard are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the resolution. The chalkboard discovery drives the narrative well, though the postcards' role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Autumn and fireflies create a vivid, evocative atmosphere. The setting enhances Ember's introspection, though the thrift shop could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fireflies, chalkboard) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful but could linger more on the thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on dreamy clich√©s. The chalkboard restoration feels fresh, but some phrasing is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the postcards feel secondary. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection on reinvention.</comment>
