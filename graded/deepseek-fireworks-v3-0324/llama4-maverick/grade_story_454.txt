<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but the "reckless smuggler" aspect feels underdeveloped. The rationally emotional attribute is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the funhouse sequence feels rushed. The synchronized alarms are a clever device but their abrupt stop lacks impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "jubilant despair" tone occasionally clashes with the decay-heavy atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (orb, watch) is effective, but the theme of distant companionship lacks depth. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (haunted funhouse, torn map). Some phrases feel overly ornate ("morbid perfume," "jubilant despair").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the smuggler premise feels tacked on. The length suits the story, though some ideas beg further exploration.</comment>
