<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's cautious nature and motivation to map cultural patterns are clear, but their transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places, particularly the community's sudden unity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The desert fortress and serpent skull imagery are vivid and enhance the atmosphere, though the connection to "ordered disarray" could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber rosary) and theme (art's transformative power) are effective, but the emotional resonance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly toward predictable tropes (art as liberation). Some phrasing feels overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the brevity limits deeper exploration of the community's dynamics and the archivist's growth.</comment>
