<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear but her "rash protector" trait is underdeveloped; her actions align with seeking solace but lack the impulsiveness implied by "rash."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the detour and encounter feel slightly contrived. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "howling caverns" and "wind-swept fortress" could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of imagery and symbolism, but the emotional resonance is somewhat muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on mystical tropes. Some phrases feel flowery ("vastness of the cosmos"), and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story feels constrained by its length. The style supports clarity, though the theme could be more provocative.</comment>
