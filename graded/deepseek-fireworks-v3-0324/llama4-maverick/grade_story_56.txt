<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Max's swindler persona and internal conflict are well-developed, but his shift from deceit to revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, though the computer restart feels tangential. The blank price tag and invisible allies tie into the resolution effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard setting is vivid and immersive, enhancing the story's mood and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (price tag, invisible allies) and emotional resonance, though the ending leans slightly toward sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "energetically lethargic" descriptor feels forced. The prose is purposeful but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, though some elements (computer restart) feel underutilized. The length suits the narrative.</comment>
