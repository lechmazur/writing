<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's mechanical arm and philosophical nature are intriguing but his motivation to "weave dreams" feels abstract without deeper exploration. Eira's sudden appearance lacks setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot moves swiftly but the duel's resolution feels abrupt. "Shifting equilibria" as a concept drives the action well, though the sock's role is oddly pivotal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's eerie, intellectual tone. Sensory details like the "creaking stairs" ground the abstract themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sock, lighthouse) and lyrical prose, but the duel's philosophical stakes could be sharper. Ending hints at deeper themes without fully realizing them.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("tangibly abstract"), though some phrasing leans ornate. The sock as a philosophical token is inventive but risks absurdity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits emotional resonance. The mechanical arm and lighthouse feel underutilized.</comment>
