<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but her "ingeniously clueless" nature feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her goal, but the trait lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the connection between haunted inn logs and a roller coaster fragment feels strained. The resolution is satisfying but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details like "rusty rails whispering" are strong, though the logs-to-track transition is jarring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "creaking supports echo page turns") are effective, and the ending has weight. However, the theme of obsession vs. discovery could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (ancient riddles, haunted logs). The "quiet mania" tone feels generic, and some phrases ("gleamed with quiet mania") are repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some feel forced (logs to roller coaster). The brevity works, though the story leans on clich√©s rather than subverting them.</comment>
