<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's pessimism is consistent but lacks deeper exploration. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic for the setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels constrained by the word limit. The ending is abrupt, lacking resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—decay and void are vividly rendered, though the mushroom house feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, flyer) and mood, but the theme of memory distortion isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in tone but leans on familiar tropes (void, pessimism). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels like a vignette—lacks the depth to linger beyond its eerie mood.</comment>
