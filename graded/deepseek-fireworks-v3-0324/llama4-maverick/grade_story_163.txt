<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The heiress's motivation is clear but her "bitterly optimistic" attribute feels underdeveloped. The parking stub as a connection to her past is evocative but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the detour feels contrived. The unification of her reality is compelling, though the pacing rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details (clouds, station). The scenic overlook is a standout moment, but the xenobiology station's potential is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (stub as talisman) and imagery, but the theme of "fragmented reality" is stated more than shown. The ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on predictable tropes (lost heiress, scientific discovery). Some phrases feel overly flowery ("reckless precision").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but the elements feel serviceable rather than transformative. The length suits the arc, but the depth is surface-level.</comment>
