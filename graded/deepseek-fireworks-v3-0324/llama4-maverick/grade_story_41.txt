<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elian's cosmic powers and academic wildness are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The abyss and corridor are vivid but their connection to the ritual could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere, though the "ordered disarray" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brooch, abyss) and emotional resonance, but the cosmic powers theme feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on cosmic/family tropes. Some phrases ("academically wild") feel forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the cosmic-worker duality isn't fully integrated. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>
