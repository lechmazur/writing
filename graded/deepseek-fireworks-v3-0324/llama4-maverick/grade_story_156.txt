<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The diplomat's confusion and motivation are clear, but their transformation feels somewhat abrupt. The "joyfully tragic" attribute is underutilized in shaping their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts ("counterpoint of hearts") without grounding them fully. The bus rides and birds provide structure, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is vividly eerie, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mood. However, the subterranean village's connection to the birds feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (birds, key) and evocative prose, but the theme of "evolutionary wisdom" is more stated than deeply explored. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into flowery phrasing ("joyfully tragic melody"). The diplomat's voice lacks distinctiveness, and some metaphors feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The elements cohere, but the story struggles to balance abstraction with concrete details. The brevity works, though some themes could be fleshed out further.</comment>
