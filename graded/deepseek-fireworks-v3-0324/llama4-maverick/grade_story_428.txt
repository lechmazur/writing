<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but her transition from city planner to prepper feels underexplored. The ink blotter as a symbol is effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has coherence but the handshake deal feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though some transitions lack smoothness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the temple's connection to the character's arc could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's warning feels slightly tacked on. Emotional resonance is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some clich√©d phrasing ("whisper a warning," "diamonds in the sky"). Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering thought, though not deeply resonant.</comment>
