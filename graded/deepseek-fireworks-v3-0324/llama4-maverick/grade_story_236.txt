<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the 'meek blacksmith' archetype lacks deeper nuance. The dictionary as a companion is a strong touch, but the bargain's weight feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in resolving the bargain. The hitchhikers' stories add texture, but their integration into the blacksmith's craft isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the 'planning office' feels underutilized. Luminescent fish and regret create a haunting mood, though the timeframe is abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dictionary, forge) and evocative prose, but the ending lacks punch. Themes of regret and time are poignant but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (lonely craftsman, cryptic bargain). Some phrases feel overly poetic without substance. Emotional resonance is stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the underwater setting feels incidental. The story's brevity works, though the bargain's resolution is unsatisfying.</comment>
