<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The faux fortune teller's real visions add intrigue, but deeper personality nuances are missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The bone flute's discovery drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise is original, but some phrasing feels formulaic. The tone shifts slightly unnaturally, and the emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but the lingering thought it leaves could be stronger.</comment>
