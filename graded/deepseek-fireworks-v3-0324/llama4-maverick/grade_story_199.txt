<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jenkins' overzealous nature and motivation are clear, but her depth could be richer. The notebook connection to her grandmother is strong, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The notebook's hidden pattern revelation is effective, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The "familiarly unknown" scent and chaotic organization tone enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and uses symbolism well (notebook as legacy). The ending is purposeful, but the theme of the goddess could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (mysterious grandmother, hidden secrets). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, though the goddess subplot could be more developed.</comment>
