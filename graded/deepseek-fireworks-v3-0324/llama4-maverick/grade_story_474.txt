<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the connection to the chessboard adds depth, though the "radio host" aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed; the cooking class run-in is abrupt, and the celestial grotto setting doesn't fully integrate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; the grotto and shadows are vivid, yet the cooking class clashes tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chessboard) and emotional resonance, though some themes (diversity) are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (kindred spirits, afterlife); prose avoids clich√© but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements feel forced together; the story's cohesion suffers from competing tones (mystical vs. mundane).</comment>
