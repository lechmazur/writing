<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from regret to discovery, though the "reversed trails" method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The diner and archive create a rich, immersive atmosphere, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The contrast between the whistle's melancholy and the diner's brightness is striking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
