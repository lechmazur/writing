<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's underachieving nature and motivation to reclaim his heritage are clear, but his "exceptionally usual" aura feels underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the doll head and packages, but the space station setting feels disconnected from the farmland subplot, weakening the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative but uneven; the decay of the space station clashes with the farmland's impending sale without meaningful thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (doll head, packages) is effective, but the "bored excitement" tone undermines emotional impact. The ending hints at depth but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (lost heritage, magical objects). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the space station and farmland feel forced together. The brevity highlights gaps in cohesion.</comment>
