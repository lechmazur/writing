<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, but their dual focus on brewing and dialects feels slightly disjointed. The metal straw as a talisman adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed in connecting brewing and linguistics. The carnival poster deciphering is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are vividly rendered, but the "after the wheel" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (straw, dialects) and atmosphere, but the thematic pivot from brewing to linguistics lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and premise, though some phrases ("metallic beasts") verge on clich√©. Emotional resonance is genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious scope, but the linguistic focus overshadows brewing. Ends with a lingering, if uneven, impact.</comment>
