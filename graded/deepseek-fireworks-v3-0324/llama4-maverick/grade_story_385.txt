<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's manipulative nature and motivation to decode symbols are clear, but their "pleasant meddler" trait feels underdeveloped. The connection between their actions and their personality is somewhat tenuous.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies heavily on abstract metaphors. The rusted ice skates as a catalyst feel forced, and the pacing is uneven due to the dense symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to balance its many elements. The brief length feels deliberate, though some ideas are underdeveloped.</comment>
