<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The philosopher-king's motivation is clear but his "earnestly frivolous" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the confetti-coded proposals feel contrived. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth and floating lanterns create a vivid atmosphere, but the connection to the kaleidoscope could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (kaleidoscope as fate) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but some phrases verge on flowery. The "transformative betrayal" concept feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its length. The kaleidoscopeâ€™s role is compelling, but other elements (e.g., confetti) detract.</comment>
