<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner's apathy and enthusiasm-lazy dichotomy is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. Their motivation to rebuild reefs is clear but somewhat abrupt in its emergence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on abstract logic (matching frames to unlock river wisdom). Pacing is uneven, with the climax feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—evocative sensory details (dusty grinder, ghostly frames) immerse the reader. The dying god's aftermath is hauntingly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of frames, river rhythms) are effective but overexplained. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is middling—the "apathetic savior" trope is familiar, and the river wisdom concept feels underdeveloped. Some phrases verge on flowery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The dream studio and coral reefs clash tonally without sufficient bridging.</comment>
