<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. Their actions align with their role as a dream interpreter, but deeper personality nuances are missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The calcification as a key action drives the narrative effectively, though the impersonation subplot feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and eerie, with strong sensory details. The vapor collection facility enhances the story's surreal tone, though the "baking heat" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and uses symbolism well (e.g., the invitation as a call to revolution). The ending is purposeful, but some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise is original, but the "quiet pulse" and "peculiar faith" feel slightly generic. The writing avoids clich√©s but could lean further into unique stylistic choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering question about the mystical realm's transformation, suggesting depth.</comment>
