<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The noble's transformation from listlessness to engagement is clear, but their "naively sophisticated" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in the latter half, and the ritual's execution lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The corn maze and haunted plain create a vivid, eerie atmosphere, though the "before sentience" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (scarf, laughter) is effective, but the theme of "intention" is stated rather than deeply explored. The ending resonates but lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (noble ennui, mystical gatherings). Some phrasing feels overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit, leaving key moments underdeveloped.</comment>
