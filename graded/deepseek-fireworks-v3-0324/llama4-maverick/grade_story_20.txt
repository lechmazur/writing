<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear but their "passionate disinterest" feels contradictory and undermines consistency. Their actions align, but the emotional depth is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the inverted waterfall and bridge of regret feel underutilized as drivers. Pacing is smooth but lacks urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall is evocative, but celestial bodies and roadside attraction clash tonally. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (comb, bridge) is effective, but the theme of regret is heavy-handed. Ending resolves cleanly but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable metaphors ("bridge of regret"). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("anxiously calm demeanor").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story leans on tropes. Length feels deliberate, though the comb's significance is underdeveloped.</comment>
