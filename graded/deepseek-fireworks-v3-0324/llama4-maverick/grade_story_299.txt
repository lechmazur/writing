<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "cheerful gloom" tone could be more deeply integrated into the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by the story's brevity and lack of deeper conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into predictable phrasing ("imperfect love," "serpentine ribbon"). Nuanced emotion is present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the ending feels more tidy than resonant. The elements serve the story well, but the execution lacks a lasting punch.</comment>
