<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sellsword's joviality and reluctance are somewhat clear, but his motivation to "dethrone doubt" feels underdeveloped. His connection to the time capsule is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and progresses logically, but the resolution of the "withering vow" feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's herb garden is vividly rendered, and the telescope's glow enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the "elegant mayhem" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (telescope as a key) work well, but the theme of doubt vs. conviction could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”the telescope and garden are fresh, but the "withering vow" and treasure tropes feel generic. Some phrasing leans flowery without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its length. The map's discovery hints at depth but isn't fully explored.</comment>
