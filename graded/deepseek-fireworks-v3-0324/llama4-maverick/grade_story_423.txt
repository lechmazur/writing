<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "unknowingly familiar" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, but his inner voice lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the greenhouse mapping serving as a strong trigger. However, the transition from aqueduct to greenhouse feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The desert and ruined greenhouse create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "warm orange glow") are evocative, though the aqueduct's role is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars, flames) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, but the "canvas of life" theme occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its imagery but leans on archetypal knightly quest tropes. Some phrases ("celestial ballet") verge on cliché, though the emotional core feels genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, and the brevity works. The knight’s resolve lingers, though the aqueduct’s narrative purpose remains unclear.</comment>
