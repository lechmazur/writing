<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The botanical illustration effectively reveals their desperation and connection to family history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The roller coaster setting drives the action, though the transition to clarity at the peak is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—sensory details (rust, decay, wind) immerse the reader. The haunted park amplifies the legacy's weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (illustration as key, roller coaster as life) works well, but the ending's hope feels unearned. Subtext about rebirth is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on gothic tropes (decaying aristocracy, haunted settings). Some phrases ("whispers of forgotten laughter") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The illustration and park are well-utilized; the walk/drive choice is forgettable.</comment>
