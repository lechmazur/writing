<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but the "obnoxiously polite" attribute feels underutilized, not deeply shaping actions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has coherence but the climax feels abrupt; the laundry cycles and salt crystals distract from the oak grove's significance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels cramped by its length, sacrificing depth for cohesion.</comment>
