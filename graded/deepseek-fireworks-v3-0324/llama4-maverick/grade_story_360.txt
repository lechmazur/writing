<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's motivation is clear and consistent, but their 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The character's reaction to the pen reveals depth, but their personality could be more vividly drawn.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The dew-drop method is inventive but slightly contrived. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground goblin city and crystal cave are evocatively rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mystic atmosphere. The playground sounds add an intriguing contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the pen, dew drop) are effective, and the theme of unraveling life/death is compelling. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the narrative avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery and accomplishment.</comment>
