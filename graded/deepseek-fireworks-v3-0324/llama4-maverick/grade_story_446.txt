<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear but his "amiable" nature feels underdeveloped. His obsession with the ledger is compelling but lacks deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between petal-falling and hydrolyzing feels forced. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds are vividly rendered, but the "peaceful anger" tone clashes slightly with the serene setting. Sensory details excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the theme of "unbecoming" remains abstract. The ending hints at depth but doesn’t fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (e.g., "whisper of petals"). The gambler’s logic feels too neat, lacking human unpredictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some (like "charity drives") feel tacked on. The story’s brevity works, though it leans on atmospheric shorthand.</comment>
