<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'apologetic thug' trait feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his desire to break free from the past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The staged meetings drive the narrative, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative but underutilized. The atmosphere supports the tone but lacks deeper integration with the character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crate slat) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (mysterious woman as catalyst). Some phrasing feels overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, though deeper thematic exploration would elevate it further.</comment>
