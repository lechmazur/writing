<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The matchmaker's sharp gentleness and rebellious nature are well-conveyed, but her interstellar motivation feels slightly detached from her matchmaking role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere; the interstellar secret's resolution is hinted at rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating library and zeppelin setting is vividly rendered, though "between channels" lacks clarity. Sensory details (lanterns, wind) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (button, flag) and subtext, but the lament's emotional impact could be deeper. The ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "sharp gentleness" feels slightly overused. The button's symbolism avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the interstellar thread feels underdeveloped. The brevity suits the tone, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
