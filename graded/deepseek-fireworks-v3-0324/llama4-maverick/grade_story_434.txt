<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but her "commonly individual" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with guarding the artifact, but her distinct voice is muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the zero-gravity flame method feels contrived. Pacing is tight, though the resolution lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”evocative sensory details and a haunting tone elevate the setting. The booth and whispers mesh well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism, but emotional resonance is shallow. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (malevolent spirits, artifact tropes). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("dark honey" prose).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by them. The length suits the premise, though depth is sacrificed.</comment>
