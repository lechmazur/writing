<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brewer's absent-mindedness and ironic hopefulness are somewhat explored, but his motivation feels slightly generic. The encounter sparks change, but deeper introspection is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the train station encounter feels abrupt. Pacing is decent, though the resolution leans on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The nature sound archive and AI-era setting are evocative, but the train station feels disconnected. Sensory details (brewery sounds, lion knocker) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (lion knocker, nature sounds) works well, but the theme of human connection is stated rather than deeply explored. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”AI-era backdrop is underutilized. Some phrases feel flowery ("storms of doubt"). Emotional nuance is surface-level at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story leans on tropes (redemptive encounter). Length feels deliberate, though the theme lacks depth.</comment>
