<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ranger's feral nature and unfiltered perception are compelling but could be more deeply explored. Her motivation is clear but somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the code words feel slightly contrived as a narrative device.</comment>
