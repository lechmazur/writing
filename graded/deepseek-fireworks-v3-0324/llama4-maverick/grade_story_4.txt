<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The DJ's motivation to map sacred spaces is clear, but their personality lacks depth beyond their role. The vintage pencil case adds a layer of mystique, but the character's 'voice' is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the DJ's unorthodox method, but the connection between filing paperwork and the climax feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the greenhouse and borrowed starlight tone enhancing the mystical mood. Sensory details are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (pencil case, sweater thread) are effective, and the ending is satisfying. However, the central conflict (mapping vs. mundane tasks) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "borrowed starlight tone"). Nuanced emotion is shown through action rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the style supports clarity. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, though some thematic depth is hinted at rather than explored.</comment>
