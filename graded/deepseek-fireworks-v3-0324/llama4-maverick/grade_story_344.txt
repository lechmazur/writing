<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's claustrophobia and motivation to study human behavior are clear, but the connection between these traits and their actions (tasting jam) feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, but the pacing feels rushed in places, particularly the transition from claustrophobia to jam-induced revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly rendered, and the dappled sunlight adds atmosphere, but the underwater setting isn't fully exploited to enhance tension or mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes quiet reflection and uses symbolism (jam as metaphor for human connection), but the emotional impact is muted by the abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise is original, but some phrases ("lightly heavyhearted," "quietly bold") feel contrived. The jam-tasting method is inventive but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates most elements, but the underwater explorer's claustrophobia and the tea house's healing touch feel underutilized.</comment>
