<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dreamer's motivation is clear but their "ferociously polite" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their actions align with their mission, but the "nomadic" aspect is barely explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The mariner's wheel as a symbol works well, though the coin toss framing is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances the dreamer's mission. The connection between the wheel and the setting is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is occasionally diluted by overly poetic phrasing. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on flowery, and the "masked intentions" concept feels underexplored. The tone is consistent, but originality is hampered by predictable beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and the elements serve the narrative well. The brevity works, but the dreamer's "nomadic" trait and the coin toss could be better integrated.</comment>
