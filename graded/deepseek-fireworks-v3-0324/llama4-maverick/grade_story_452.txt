<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The softhearted champion's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration. Their actions align with their traits, but the 'voice' feels somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method of stabilizing fate via planetarium visits is intriguing but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and abandoned planetarium create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details are effective, though the police station feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery. The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict could be sharper. Theme of balance is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes. Emotional resonance is present but could be deeper. Language avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though some elements feel underused.</comment>
