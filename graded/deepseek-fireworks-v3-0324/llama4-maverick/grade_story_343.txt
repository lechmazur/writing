<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The jester's melancholy and motivation to restore sacred practices are clear and consistent, but his "iconically unintentional" attribute feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the tea-leaf method feels slightly contrived as a means to drive the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into predictable tropes (reclusive captain, forgotten rituals). Some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the tea-leaf analysis feels less integrated than other elements. Leaves a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
