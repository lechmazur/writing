<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but her "logically emotional" trait feels underdeveloped. The skeleton key necklace is a strong symbol, but her "grandiose modesty" lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The "final countdown" tension is underutilized, and the resolution feels abrupt despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and garden scent create vivid atmosphere, but the tunnels' decay could be more immersive. Sensory details are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (necklace, whispers) works, but the theme of survival isn't fully explored. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (smuggler with a past). Some phrases feel AI-polished ("grandiose modesty"). Emotional nuance is stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by them. The length suits the premise, but the execution lacks daring.</comment>
