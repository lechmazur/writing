<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's borderline immortality and rigidly flexible nature are well-explored, but their motivation to restore the ecosystem could be more deeply integrated with their personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed; the connection between the earbud cover and the garden's revival could be more logically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of decay and latent energy is immersive, though the timeframe ("during sketching") feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, but the tight word limit slightly hampers the full exploration of its ambitious concepts.</comment>
