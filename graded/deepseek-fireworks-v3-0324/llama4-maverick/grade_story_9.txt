<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "mildly panicked soothsayer" trait feels underdeveloped. The puzzle box and sarcasm add depth, but the soothsayer aspect lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the puzzle box, but the environmental stewardship concept feels tacked on. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert and billboard maze are vividly rendered, but the "lost years" timeframe is vague. Sensory details (exhaust, water rings) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (puzzle box, water rings) and a memorable voice, but the environmental theme lacks subtlety. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in its surreal setting and sarcastic tone, but the "probably unlikely" phrasing feels repetitive. Some metaphors (molten sarcasm) are fresh, others generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the environmental message feels forced. The brevity works, but the story leans on tropes (chosen one, dystopia).</comment>
