<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the transition from puzzle piece to map feels abrupt. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hydroponic noodle farm and leaf blowers create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, but the confetti's role feels slightly disjointed from the setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, though some phrases ("agonizing bliss") verge on overwrought. Avoids clich√©s but could refine emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story's cohesion slightly suffers from the abrupt introduction of xenophobia and confetti.</comment>
