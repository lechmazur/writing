<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's motivation is clear and his reaction to the schematic reveals depth, but his 'subtle' nature could be more distinctly voiced or explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc within the tight word limit, though the connection between the schematic and the forest's patterns feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The petrified forest is evocatively rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere, though the 'resonating' trees border on overused mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a satisfying ending. The theme of wisdom is effectively conveyed, though the 'silent celebration' could be more impactful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the schematic's role could be sharper.</comment>
