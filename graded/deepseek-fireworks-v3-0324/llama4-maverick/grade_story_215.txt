<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but the "rattled exorcist" trait feels underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated with the scientific pursuit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the dance lesson detour disrupts pacing. The puzzle-solving arc is effective but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with strong sensory details, though the psychic facility's eerie tone clashes slightly with the dance lesson interlude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the dance lesson feels forced. The brevity works, though some themes lack exploration.</comment>
