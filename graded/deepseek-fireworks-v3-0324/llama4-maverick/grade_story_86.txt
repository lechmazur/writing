<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's apprehension and motivation are clear, but her exceptional marksmanship feels underutilized. The contrast between her past joy and current mission adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the hot air balloon flashback disrupts pacing. The resolution feels rushed yet satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and candle's flickering shadows create a vivid atmosphere, though the "borrowed dawn" tone clashes slightly with the high-tech backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, pit of lies) and emotional resonance, but the theme of "cycles of compassion" is underdeveloped. The ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in combining cyberpunk with mythic undertones, but some phrases ("skeletal hand," "borrowed dawn") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, though the cyberpunk setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, but the story leans on familiar tropes.</comment>
