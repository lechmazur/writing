<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his "naive" trait is underdeveloped, though his existential struggle adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the tidal station and lectures feel underutilized as driving forces.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—evocative sensory details (candlelight, tides) enhance mood, though the station's purpose is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the professors' lectures feel tacked on. Ending is poignant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar existential tropes. Some phrases ("laughing tears") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but don't fully transcend their assigned roles. The length feels deliberate, though some ideas need more room.</comment>
