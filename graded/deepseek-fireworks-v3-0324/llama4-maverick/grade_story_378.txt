<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mayor's grumpiness and reluctant awe are clear, but their transformation feels somewhat abrupt. Motivation shifts from survival to fate-changing could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed in places. The ritual's execution lacks detail, and the cafe conversation feels like a convenient plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere with vivid contrasts (carnival vs. swamp). Sensory details are effective, though the monks' reclusiveness could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is muted by rushed pacing. Theme of restoration is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (clockwork beetle as catalyst). Some phrasing leans generic, but the core idea avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. Ends with purpose but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
