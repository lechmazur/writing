<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The broken chopsticks effectively symbolize her fractured past, but her internal depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the cookbook instructions feel underdeveloped. The arc is complete, though the transition from silence to empowerment could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submarine facility's sterile, eerie atmosphere is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystic tone. Sensory details (buzzing lights, silence) are used masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext elevate the narrative, but the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. The theme of beauty in chaos is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on flowery. The chopsticks as a symbol are fresh, but the 'familiar enigma' tone risks clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, though the cookbook element weakens cohesion.</comment>
