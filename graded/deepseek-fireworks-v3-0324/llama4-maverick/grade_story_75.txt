<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's guarded nature and motivation to learn extinct crafts are clear, but their "skeptically credulous" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their anger and resolve are compelling, but the transition from curiosity to fury lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the decrypting of vows feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the grassroots concept isn't fully integrated into the conflict's resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is imaginative but underutilized. Atmosphere supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, vows) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the "angry peace" tone could be more subtly woven into the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "angry peace"), but some phrasing leans generic ("whispers of the forest"). Avoids clich√©s but occasionally over-explains emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite complexity, but the nano-forest feels tacked on. The story's brevity works, though deeper thematic exploration would elevate it.</comment>
