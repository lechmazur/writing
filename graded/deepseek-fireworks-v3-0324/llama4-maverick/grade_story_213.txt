<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but her transition from lab guard to wedding guest feels abrupt. The hair clip symbolism is strong, but her "primal sophistication" lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on the clip's destruction, but the shift from lab to restaurant is disjointed. Pacing suffers from compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lab and wedding contrast intriguingly, but the lab's role is underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., shattered glass) are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (clip as the past) and the declarative ending work well. The theme of storytelling's power is compelling but slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans on clich√©s (smashing glass as rebellion). "Primal sophistication" feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the clip's destruction, but the lab/wedging mashup strains logic. The ending lingers, though.</comment>
