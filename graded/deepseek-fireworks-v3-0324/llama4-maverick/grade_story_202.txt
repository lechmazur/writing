<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poisoner's motivation is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. Their "innocently guilty" expression is a strong touch, but their actions feel somewhat generic for a poisoner.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains momentum, but the scavenger hunt device feels contrived. The ending is purposeful but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered, and the "dusty starlight" tone enhances the atmosphere. Skateboarding adds energy but clashes slightly with the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending lingers but doesn’t fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (scavenger hunts, shadowy figures). The prose avoids clichés but occasionally feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The rapier and poisoner are compelling, but the scavenger hunt weakens the whole.</comment>
