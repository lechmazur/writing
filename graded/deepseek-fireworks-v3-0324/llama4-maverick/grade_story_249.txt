<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vigilante's motivation is clear but their "lazily ambitious" nature feels underdeveloped. The antique dentist's drill adds a quirky touch, but their actions could better reflect their attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the method of luring collectors via barbershop quartet gossip feels contrived. Pacing is decent, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the forgotten fountains and rain-pause timeframe enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, but the whimsical tone clashes slightly with the vigilante's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has literary flair with effective symbolism (e.g., the drill as a restoration tool). However, the emotional impact is muted, and the theme of resilience could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and a unique premise. Some phrases verge on overly ornate, but the voice avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels slightly constrained by its elements. The ending lingers, though the whimsy undermines the gravity of the vigilante's mission.</comment>
