<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The deputy's impassive nature and cautious bravery are well-conveyed, but her motivation to witness "pure grace" feels slightly abstract and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but hinges on an odd juxtaposition (oil change in a cathedral orchard). The arc is clear, though the pacing feels rushed near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with lush sensory details, but the abandoned cathedral's connection to the oil change is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (twist tie, bees) and atmospheric tension, but the emotional impact is muted by the deputy's detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on mystical tropes. The bees' secret language feels fresh, though the "uncharted echoes" motif is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting vignette, but the oil change and cathedral orchard clash tonally. The brevity works, but some logic gaps linger.</comment>
