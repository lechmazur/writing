<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conjurer's restless nature and motivation to turn imagination into reality are clear and drive the plot, but their "voice" lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the road closure feels contrived as a plot device. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>
