<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but her "singularly multiple" focus feels underdeveloped. Her connection to plants is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The puzzle metaphor works well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "perpetual motion" aspect could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by some abstract phrasing. The ending is satisfying but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into flowery prose. The "graceless beauty" tone is unique but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, though some elements (e.g., the violin string) distract more than enrich.</comment>
