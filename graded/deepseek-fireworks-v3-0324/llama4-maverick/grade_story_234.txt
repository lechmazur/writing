<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gentle swordsman's late-bloomer motivation is clear, but his "faithfully unfaithful" attribute feels underdeveloped. The empty matchbox as a token is evocative but lacks deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The sundial connection to the T-Rex skeleton is intriguing but abrupt, lacking setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the orchard dog's barking feels tangential. The brusque affection tone clashes slightly with the ethereal ending.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (matchbox, sundial), but the theme of late bloomers is stated rather than shown. The ending's "ethereal light" verges on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but uneven in execution. The xenophile curiosity feels fresh, while "cradle the universe" risks purple prose. Some AI-like abruptness in transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack seamless integration. The length feels deliberate, though the sundial method and museum setting could be more intertwined.</comment>
