<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivations and reactions are clear but somewhat underdeveloped. The inherited rivalries add depth, but their distinct 'voice' is muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slight. The bickering over cloud interpretations drives tension, yet the resolution is too abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of futuristic and traditional elements is vivid, but the rooftop stables' purpose isn't fully justified. Sensory details are strong.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending tech and tradition, though some phrases verge on generic. Nuance in rivalry and atmosphere elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The mundanity-enchantment contrast is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
