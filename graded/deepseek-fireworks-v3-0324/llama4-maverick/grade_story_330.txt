<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's dejection and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels abrupt. His "normally abnormal" trait is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on mystical vagueness. The trident prong's discovery drives the narrative, though the zero-gravity setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details ("whispers of forgotten lore"), but the zero-gravity dance hall clashes tonally with the relic-hunting premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (trident prong, vow) and evocative prose, but the ending's resolution lacks emotional depth. Theme of duty is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (knight, relic). Some phrases ("sacred disorder") feel forced. Nuance in emotion is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the zero-gravity setting feels incongruous. The story's brevity works, though some themes are underdeveloped.</comment>
