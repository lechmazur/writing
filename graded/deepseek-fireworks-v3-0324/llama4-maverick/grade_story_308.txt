<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bashful executioner's character is intriguing but his motivation to preserve dance movements feels slightly forced. His reaction to the fireworks and keychain adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but the connection between the executioner's role and the dance preservation feels tenuous. Pacing is decent but rushed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and festival atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like incense and fireworks are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion but leans on telling over showing. The keychain's symbolism works, but the theme of community feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans slightly generic. Some phrases ("benign ferocity") feel contrived. Emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere reasonably well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ending lingers but lacks profound impact.</comment>
