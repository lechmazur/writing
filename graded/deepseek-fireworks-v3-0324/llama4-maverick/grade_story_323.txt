<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dancer's carefree nature and obsession with sacred practices are clear, but her motivation could be deeper. The shoelace detail adds charm but feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows well with a clear arc, though the ritual's climax feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit, but some transitions could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with rich sensory details. The "phantasmal humor" tone enhances the whimsy, though it occasionally overshadows deeper atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shoelace, seeds) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "embracing the absurd" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The dancer's voice and the metropolis's quirks feel unique, though some metaphors verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of magic.</comment>
