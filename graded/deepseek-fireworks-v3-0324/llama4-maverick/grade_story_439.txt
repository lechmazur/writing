<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mute courier's silence adds intrigue, but his motivation ("to find hidden meanings") feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with curiosity, but deeper introspection is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from arrival to transcendence. The comet's role feels abrupt, but the interdimensional pivot is intriguing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphereâ€”decaying opera house and snow-cloaked harbor merge seamlessly. Sensory details (creaky door, ethereal glow) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comet, chalk) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful, though the "mind's escape" theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original but leans slightly into mystical tropes. The comet's guidance feels contrived, but the courier's muted boldness is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. Elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers with a sense of wonder.</comment>
