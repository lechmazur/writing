<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "serendipitously stubborn" attribute feels underdeveloped. The photograph effectively reveals her longing for freedom.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed. The method of collecting stories is intriguing but lacks depth in execution. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lunar greenhouse setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood, but the "park visits" timeframe feels disconnected. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is present but uneven. Symbolism (photograph, greenhouse) works well, but the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (rebirth, controlling influence). Some phrases feel formulaic, though the setting is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not fully integrated. The story shows promise but lacks the depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
