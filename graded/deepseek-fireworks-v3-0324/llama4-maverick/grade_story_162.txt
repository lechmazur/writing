<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's carefree gambler trait is underutilized; their motivation is clear but lacks depth in alignment with their assigned attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed; the blueprint's revelation is effective, though the island memories connection could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "hush of old videotapes" feels tangential. Sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the theme of harmony in chaos is compelling, but the emotional resonance is muted by abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (mysterious stranger, shared secret). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans heavily on assigned elements without fully transcending them. The ending is satisfying but not groundbreaking.</comment>
