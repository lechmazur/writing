<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fighter's motivation is clear but their "skillfully incompetent" attribute feels underdeveloped. Their resolve is compelling, but the deception angle lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The abduction's method ("forgotten dreams") is intriguing but underutilized, leaving the resolution abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The attic and clockwork animals create a vivid, eerie atmosphere, though the "forgotten dreams" realm lacks sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (clay shard, clockwork animals) and thematic depth, but the emotional impact is muted by the rushed climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but some phrasing feels formulaic ("bruised fighter," "mechanical hearts ticking"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the brevity limits thematic exploration. The ending hints at depth but doesnâ€™t fully deliver.</comment>
