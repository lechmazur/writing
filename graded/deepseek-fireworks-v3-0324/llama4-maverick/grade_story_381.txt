<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The necromancer's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the baseball cap and love for old movies add uniqueness, though deeper introspection could strengthen their voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the "sound of resolve" feels underutilized as a driving force. The partnership arc is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The ethereal glow and cinematic shimmer elevate the atmosphere, though "futuristic nostalgia" clashes slightly with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the cap as symbolism) are effective, and the theme of collaboration resonates. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the necromancer-guide dynamic, but some phrases ("futuristic nostalgia") feel forced. Emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the story leans on nostalgia as a crutch. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic expansion.</comment>
