<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lovelorn spy's motivation is somewhat clear but lacks depth. The unused sticky label and reflections add intrigue, but the character's emotional complexity feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed. The shared interest in urban exploration drives the cat-and-mouse game well, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The futuristic city slums are vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances tension, though the "rambling destiny" tone occasionally clashes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (label, reflections) and a memorable ending, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The theme of identity is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (spy vs. adversary). Some phrases feel repetitive or overly poetic. The "avalanche" metaphor is fresh, but other elements lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brevity works, though some ideas feel underexplored. Leaves a lingering question about identity.</comment>
