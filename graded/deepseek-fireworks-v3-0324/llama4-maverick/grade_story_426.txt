<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's "angrily peaceful" demeanor and mission to preserve folk medicines are intriguing but somewhat underdeveloped. The teapot as a symbol works well, but the connection to marathon training feels forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on contrivances (hacking playlists for lost works). The pacing is uneven, with the marathon training subplot detracting from the core mystery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the ghost train's eerie tone clashes awkwardly with the folk medicine and prodigy themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story has moments of evocative imagery (the teapot, the melody), but the emotional impact is diluted by disjointed elements. The ending feels abrupt yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution falters with AI-like leaps (hacking playlists for genius clues). The "angrily peaceful" and "aloof passion" traits feel more stylistic than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively blend its many elements. The teapot and prodigy threads show promise, but the marathon training and hacking methods undermine its depth.</comment>
