<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the guilt and redemption arc feels familiar. The violin's role in their development is strong but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on convenience (emergency landing). The road trip feels abrupt, though the arc from guilt to purpose is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Mesopotamian temple is vividly rendered, but its connection to the violin is tenuous. Sensory details (dust, crumbling walls) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (violin as catalyst), but the theme of wonder is stated rather than shown. Ending is purposeful but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (guilt-driven curator, magical artifact). Some phrases ("ethereal beauty") feel AI-polished rather than fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but don't fully transcend their assigned roles. The length suits the arc, but the road trip detour weakens focus.</comment>
