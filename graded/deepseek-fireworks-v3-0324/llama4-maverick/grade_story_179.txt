<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watchman's confidence and motivation are clear, but his "forcibly gentle" attribute feels underdeveloped. His yearning and envy are compelling but could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the fingerprint, ruler, and bees feels tenuous. Pacing is strong, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vivid and immersive, but its connection to the watchman's internal struggle isn't fully realized. Sensory details are evocative but occasionally overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (fingerprint, ruler) is effective, but the emotional payoff ("jubilant remorse") feels overstated. The theme of transformation is clear but lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable phrasing ("imperfect beauty," "soothing hum"). Some metaphors feel fresh (fingerprint as journey), others generic (bees as energy).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The length feels deliberate, though the ending leans toward sentimentality. Leaves a lingering but vague impression.</comment>
