<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The monk's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'timidly loud' attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his quest for forgotten languages.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the storm chasing headquarters feels tangential. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, and the storm complements the monk's internal journey. The setting enhances the mood but slightly clashes with the headquarters element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a satisfying ending. The theme of hidden truths is well-conveyed, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on mystical tropes. The prose avoids purple tendencies but occasionally feels overly formal. Emotional resonance is genuine but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the storm chasing setting slightly detracts.</comment>
