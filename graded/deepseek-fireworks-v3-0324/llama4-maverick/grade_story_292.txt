<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raider's hesitant yet open-minded nature is well-explored, but their transformation feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the transition from observer to performer could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The speakeasy's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood, though the "family talent show" clashes tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the mug) and thematic depth, but the ending's catharsis leans slightly toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, but some phrases ("restless trust") feel contrived, and the talent show premise strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the speakeasy/talent show pairing feels incongruous. The brevity serves the story well.</comment>
