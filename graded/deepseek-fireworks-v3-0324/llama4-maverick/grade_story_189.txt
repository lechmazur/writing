<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the transition from star maps to overcharge revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the brief length slightly limits thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of purpose.</comment>
