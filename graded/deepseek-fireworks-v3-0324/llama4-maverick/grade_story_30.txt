<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; telekinetic dice add uniqueness but feel underutilized in revealing deeper character traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the tapestry's revelation is compelling but rushed due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed, blending space piracy and medieval mysticism effectively, though the navigation room feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (lost languages, balance); some prose verges on purple without deeper payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the space pirate setting feels tacked on rather than integral to the core themes.</comment>
