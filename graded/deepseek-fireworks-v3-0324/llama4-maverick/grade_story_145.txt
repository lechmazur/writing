<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but their "uncertainly certain" attribute feels slightly forced. The rosebud adds depth, but the dropout's voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the echo test method feels contrived. Pacing is tight, though the mansion's connection to the library is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the "hush of colliding destinies" is more poetic than integrated into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (rosebud, pipes) is effective, but the theme of empathy is stated rather than shown. Ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (secret society, forgotten ruins). Some prose leans purple, though the rosebud's revival is a fresh touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the mansion's inclusion feels tacked on. Length suits the mood, but the story's ambition slightly outstrips its execution.</comment>
