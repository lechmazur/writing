<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of their hive-mind nature. The "uniformly peculiar" attribute is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the wax method, which feels contrived. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory details, but the secret agent facility feels underdeveloped as a setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its own premise. The length suits the arc, but depth is lacking.</comment>
