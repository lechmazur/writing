<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the garnet subplot feels underdeveloped. The collaboration between Ezra and Luna is compelling but could use more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The faded orchard sign adds a poignant contrast, enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (e.g., the garnet, the sign) and shows emotional depth. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though some phrases border on overly poetic. The emotional resonance is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>
