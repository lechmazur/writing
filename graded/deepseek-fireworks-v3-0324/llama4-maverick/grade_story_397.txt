<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the doodle method, which strains believability. The scalpel's inclusion is abrupt, disrupting flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit, leaving key ideas unresolved.</comment>
