<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear but their "trickster lawyer" aspect feels underdeveloped; the impatiently patient attribute is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the windmill confrontation feels slightly rushed. Pacing is otherwise strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the biodome and windmill settings enhancing tension. Sensory details are effective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise but some phrases verge on formulaic ("ghostly resolve," "steely determination"). Nuance in emotion could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "trickster lawyer" role feels tangential. Story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
