<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but the "cynically hopeful" attribute could be more deeply explored. Aria's introduction adds depth, but the protagonist's internal conflict feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; the speed dating event feels abrupt. The connection between the drone and disseminating hope is creative but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>World-building is evocative, with strong sensory details (e.g., the herb bundle's scent). The "charred serenity" tone works well, though the observatory setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is present but uneven. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors (e.g., "horizons of mercy") feel forced. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but the speed dating element clashes with the medieval tone. Some phrasing leans flowery ("charred serenity" is repeated). Nuanced emotion is shown but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The drone pilot premise is inventive, but the brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering hope, though the execution is uneven.</comment>
