<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but the reincarnation aspect feels underdeveloped. The toy soldier adds depth but the goldfish caretaker role lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the weather-driven encounter feels contrived. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the recipe library's connection to the goldfish caretaker is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and subtext, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the playful cynicism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (redemption arc, chance encounters). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive despite forced elements. The length suits the narrative, but some themes lack depth.</comment>
