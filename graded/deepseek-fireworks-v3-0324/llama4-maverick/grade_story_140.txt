<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protector's fractured past and emotional suppression are well-conveyed, but their sudden shift in resolve feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the planetarium encounter as a deus ex machina for transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus and planetarium create a haunting, evocative atmosphere, though the timeframe ("dawn's second breath") feels overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the doll, stars) and emotional resonance, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the earlier darkness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (broken protector, symbolic doll). Some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the planetarium encounter feels contrived. The brevity works in its favor.</comment>
