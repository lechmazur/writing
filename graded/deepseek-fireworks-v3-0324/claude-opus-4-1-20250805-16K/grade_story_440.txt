<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenzo's motivation is clear and deeply personal, his actions align with his warrior-turned-seeker persona, and his 'lovingly detached' restraint adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and driven by Kenzo's quest; the collage-as-map device is inventive, though the infinite-recycling-center twist risks slight incoherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>New Tokyo's underbelly is vividly evoked, with the recycling center's chrome-and-glass juxtaposed against ancient forces. Sensory details (sea pottery's smoothness, machines' whirring) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the sea pottery as both object and symbol, the Weavers as meta-commentary on fate, and Kenzo's vow resonating beyond the page.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and freshâ€”subverts tropes (swordsman as puzzle-solver, Weavers as playful antagonists). Language is precise without being ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the whole. The ending lingers, balancing hope and cosmic gamesmanship.</comment>
