<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Markov's nearly immortal lifespan and rigidly flexible nature are well-integrated into his motivations and actions, revealing depth through his bitter laughter and meticulous sketching. His distinct voice emerges through the narrative, though more dialogue could enrich his portrayal.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the ink patterns and launch sequence driving the narrative logically. The ending feels organic and satisfying, though the word limit slightly rushes the restoration's emotional payoff.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly realized, with microsecond decay cycles and crystalline groves enhancing the surreal atmosphere. Sensory details like the earbud cover's mundanity against quantum trees ground the setting.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (ink as memory, murals as propaganda) and a layered theme of historical erasure elevate the story. The ending's bittersweet triumph lingers, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (butterflies of light pruning probability branches) and no clichés. The quantum orchard concept feels ingeniously specific, avoiding AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, with the earbud cover and ink patterns serving the story’s core theme. The length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about cyclical history.</comment>
