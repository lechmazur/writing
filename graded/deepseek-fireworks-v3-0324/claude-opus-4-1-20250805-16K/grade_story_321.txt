<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hourglass revelation driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the chef’s intervention feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen is rendered with haunting sensory detail, and the atmosphere amplifies Marcus’s torment. The timeframe (“space where an apology waits unspoken”) is brilliantly evocative.</comment>
