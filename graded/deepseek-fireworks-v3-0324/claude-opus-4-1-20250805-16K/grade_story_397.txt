<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transition from medicine to mixology is nuanced, and his motivation to understand his father's legacy is compelling and well-integrated. His actions align with his established traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned. The fragmented formula device is clever and well-executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. The cantina's liminal quality and the lab's sterile contrast are evocative. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and thematic depth. Symbolism (scalpel, receipts) is sharp, and the ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The premise is fresh, and the emotional beats feel authentic. Some phrases lean slightly generic, but the overall voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels intentional, and the narrative lingers. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
