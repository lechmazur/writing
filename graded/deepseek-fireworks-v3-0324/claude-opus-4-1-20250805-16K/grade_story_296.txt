<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dr. Chen's motivation and complexity are vividly portrayed, with her "hatefully adored" status and chaotic methodology revealing depth. Her distinct voice and actions align seamlessly with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's tight structure leverages the cookbook and broken chopstick to drive the narrative, achieving a clear arc within the word limit. Pacing is efficient, though some transitions feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submarine setting and bioluminescent chaos create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (fluorescent buzz, deep hum) enrich the mood and support Chen's unconventional methods.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—symbolism (broken chopstick), subtext (spiritual paths in chaos), and a resonant ending elevate this beyond mere plot. The theme of fractured perception lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (golden ratio fracture) and nuanced emotion. The prose is purposeful, and Chen's methodology feels uniquely human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. The cookbook's riddle and broken tool defy expectation, showcasing ingenuity.</comment>
