<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions with precision. His sardonic glee contrasts sharply with his grief, creating a complex character. However, his transition from grief to vengeance could use more nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect relationships sharply defined. The peacock tail revelation is a brilliant pivot, though the FBI’s sudden involvement feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility is inventive but underutilized as a setting. The UV-reactive powder and peacock imagery are vivid, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (the dove, the spiral) and a satisfying arc. Marcus’s final smile is a masterstroke of emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The peacock tail as a weaponized pattern is ingenious, though the sardonic tone occasionally clashes with the gravity of the tragedy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering unease about corporate malice.</comment>
