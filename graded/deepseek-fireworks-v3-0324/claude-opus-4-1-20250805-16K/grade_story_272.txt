<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed and his motivation—decoding family secrets—is clear and compelling. His use of the whistle and reversed trails method reveals deep personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect from discovery to emotional resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit; no abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner’s liminal atmosphere and flickering lights amplify the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details (whistle’s wood, Gloria’s grunt) immerse without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling: layered themes of regret and forgiveness, resonant symbolism (whistle as generational conduit), and a hauntingly satisfying ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("dying stars," "tree of regret"). Emotion is shown through action (trembling fingers) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and profound. Elements serve the story organically; the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about legacy.</comment>
