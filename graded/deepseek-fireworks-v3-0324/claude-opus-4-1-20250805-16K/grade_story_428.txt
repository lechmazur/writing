<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his shift to seeking ancient wisdom feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, but more internal conflict would deepen his authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. Pacing is excellent, though the final leap into the well could benefit from a touch more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is richly atmospheric, with evocative sensory details. The interplay of light, carvings, and darkness enhances the mystical tone and Marcus's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the ink blotter, constellations) and subtext (chains of control vs. liberation). The ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of urban decay and ancient mysticism feels unique, though a few phrases border on over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with creative integration of elements. The brevity serves the story well, leaving a lingering question about the nature of liberation.</comment>
