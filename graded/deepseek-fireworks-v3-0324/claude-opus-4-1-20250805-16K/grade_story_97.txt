<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera's transformation from a fact-minded oracle to one embracing empathy is clear and compelling, though her initial "desperately casual" stance could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with heartbreak-induced visions driving Vera's arc toward empathy, though the unstable dimension's rules could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly rendered, with sensory details ("reality rippled like disturbed water") enhancing the atmosphere and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the compass pointing inward) and emotional depth elevate this, though the ending’s optimism borders on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés, but "optimistic desperation" occasionally feels over-articulated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, leaving a resonant question: Can logic and empathy coexist? The brevity serves the story’s intensity.</comment>
