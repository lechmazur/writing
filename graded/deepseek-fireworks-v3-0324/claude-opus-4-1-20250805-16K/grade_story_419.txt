<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The blacksmith's no-nonsense empathy and her transition from life to ghostly purpose are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation—her rhythmic craftsmanship embodies humanity's enduring pulse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight; the museum's grief and the blacksmith's mollifying hammer strikes create a resonant arc despite the brevity. Pacing is deliberate yet fluid.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The dollhouse museum is hauntingly evocative, its miniature perfection contrasting with the vast emptiness of a post-human world. Sensory details (e.g., "light that no longer came from any sun") amplify the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hammer rhythm as heartbeat) and subtext (preservation vs. understanding). The ending transcends the ghost-story framework to reflect on legacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced. Avoids clichés—the museum's consciousness is fresh, and the blacksmith's empathy feels authentically human despite her ghostly state.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's meditation on memory. The brief length feels intentional, leaving the reader with a lingering ache for lost rhythms.</comment>
