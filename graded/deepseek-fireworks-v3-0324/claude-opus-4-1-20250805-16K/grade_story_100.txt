<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's motivations are clear and distinct, with her "rationally mischievous" nature driving her actions. Her voice is sharp and memorable, though some nuances of her dreamer persona could be deepened.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the moon paths and pennies serving as cohesive drivers. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard's atmosphere is richly evoked, blending enchantment and menace. Sensory details (copper pennies, singing blossoms) deepen immersion. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are deftly employed, and the ending lingers with thematic weight. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Minor room to deepen subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The "dour amusement" tone and cosmic deception twist defy predictability. Only a hint of overwrought phrasing in one line.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly, with the orchard and pennies elevating the theme. The length feels intentional, leaving a resonant, unresolved question.</comment>
