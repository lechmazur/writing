<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Minerva's telepathy and marble imprisonment are expertly woven into her character, with the hair tie anchoring her emotional core. Her daughter's awakening as a calligrapher is a brilliant extension of her own traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the renovation conflict, with telepathy and calligraphy driving the resolution. Pacing is brisk but balanced, and the climax feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steam-powered square is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hissing vapor, bronze gears) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the clash of truth and deceit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ink as truth, marble as imprisonment) and emotional depth. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with subtext about justice and legacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of steampunk, telepathy, and calligraphy feels fresh, and emotions are shown, not told (e.g., the hair tie's warmth).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's core theme. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers long after reading due to its layered execution.</comment>
