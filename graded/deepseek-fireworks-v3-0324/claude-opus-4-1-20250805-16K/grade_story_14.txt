<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (dice, candlelight) and subtext, the story lingers via its exploration of entropy and human stubbornness. Dialogue crackles with purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("mathematics of desperation") and nuanced emotional blends (laughter/tears) defy cliché. The dystopian framing feels original, not derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s existential core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant ache of futility and fleeting connection.</comment>
