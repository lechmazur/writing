<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swordsman's hesitancy and awkwardness are well-integrated into his actions and decisions, revealing depth. His motivation—to restore tradition—is clear but could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frigid orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (steam, ice, breath) enhance the mood and support the bridging-worlds concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (postcard, hermit crabs) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally. Theme of tradition vs. bureaucracy is subtly powerful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with all elements serving the story. Leaves a haunting question about tradition's role in modernity.</comment>
