<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit and layered motivations (duty, guilt, curiosity) are vividly portrayed, with her interactions with the ghost revealing depth. The ghost's tragic backstory and spectral persistence are equally compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Impeccable pacing and a tight, resonant arc. The dance as a narrative device elegantly bridges past and present while propelling the story toward its haunting resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is suffused with decay and melancholy, amplified by tactile details (yellowed paper, frayed rope). Atmosphere and theme merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (rope, dance, list) and subtext. The ending lingers, balancing closure with unresolved echoes of the ghost’s burden.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors ("voice like wind through broken glass"). Avoids cliché while delving into universal themes of duty and loss.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, and the story resonates beyond its word count.</comment>
