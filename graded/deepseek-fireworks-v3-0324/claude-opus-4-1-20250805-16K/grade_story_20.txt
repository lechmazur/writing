<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's transition from archer to chronicler is nuanced, and her internal conflict is clear. The comb serves as a powerful symbol of generational expectation, enriching her motivation and voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the confrontation at the waterfall serving as a natural climax. The inverted waterfall metaphor mirrors Maya's arc, lending coherence and resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall is brilliantly evocative, blending surrealism with emotional weight. Sensory details (sunlight on ascending droplets, tarnished comb) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (comb, waterfall) and subtext. The ending is poignant, tying thematic threads together without overt explanation. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("bridge of regret," "passionate disinterest") and avoidance of clich√©s. Emotional nuance in Maya's restrained confrontation feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where elements serve the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on witnessing versus participating.</comment>
