<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation is vividly clear and deeply integrated into her actions. Her 'voice' is distinct, blending scientific rigor with poetic yearning, though her backstory could be more seamlessly woven in.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly fragmented by dense poetic exposition. Pacing is strong for the word limit, but the ending feels abrupt—more a vignette than a resolved arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with sensory richness and thematic unity. The crow's nest setting contrasts brilliantly with cosmic scale, though pirate elements feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of literary devices and layered subtext. The central conflict (preservation vs. entropy) is subtle but potent. Ending lingers, though it risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "authentically artificial" theme is fresh, metaphors are precise, and emotional nuance shines. A few phrases border on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, but the pirate ship feels secondary. Length feels intentional, with depth that transcends word count. Leaves reader haunted.</comment>
