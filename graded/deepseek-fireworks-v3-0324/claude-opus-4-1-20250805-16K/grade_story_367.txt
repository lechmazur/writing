<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The herbalist's exhaustion and disillusionment are vividly portrayed, with her meticulous yet abandoned experiments revealing a deep, consistent motivation. Her "fervent indifference" is a striking paradox that drives her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with poetic precision, linking the bellows, tides, and goose’s flight into a cohesive arc. The ending’s resignation feels earned, though the tight word limit slightly truncates thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s glass-walled isolation and the goose’s ritualistic flight create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (bellows’ wheezing, crashing waves) deepen the mood of futility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bellows as failed control, samphire as overlooked truth) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending’s irony lingers, though the theme of perfection’s futility could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("perfect data sets, useless as pressed flowers") and the herbalist’s nuanced exhaustion avoid cliché. The prose is elegant but occasionally overwrought ("fervent indifference").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly, with the bellows and goose amplifying the theme. The brevity feels intentional, though deeper reflection on perfection’s cost would strengthen cohesion.</comment>
