<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's dual role as marshal and rebel is compelling, but her transition could use more nuanced exploration. Dmitri's backstory is hinted at effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with clear cause-and-effect. The raid's resolution via buried manuscripts is ingenious, though the three-hour timeframe feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating spa is vividly rendered, with cloud-moss paper and high-altitude orchids adding unique texture. Atmosphere reinforces themes of memory and resistance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (clouds as memory, gardens as libraries) and emotional depth. Ending lingers beautifully, though some metaphors verge on overused ("cracked open everything").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh take on dystopian preservation, but the fortune cookie device borders on clich√©. Dance forms are evocatively specific, avoiding generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. Word count feels deliberate, though the music festival scene could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
