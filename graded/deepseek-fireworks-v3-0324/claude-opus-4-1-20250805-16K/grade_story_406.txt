<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adelaide's motivation is clear and compelling, her actions tightly aligned with her dual role as spy and peacemaker. The loose button and nervous smile add layers to her disguise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, with reversed time cleverly driving the action. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final twist could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brewery setting is vividly rendered, with temporal details enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory elements (quicksilver, moonwater) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext (hope as disguise, reversed time as reconciliation). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though the Council's reaction could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "wisdom masquerading as naivety"). Avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic flair. Only minor stiffness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thought about reconciliation and deception.</comment>
