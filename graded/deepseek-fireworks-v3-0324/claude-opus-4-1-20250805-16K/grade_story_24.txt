<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thessaly's motivation is clear and compelling, and her actions align well with her "ordinarily extraordinary" nature. The puppet shows and her effect on the bar's patrons reveal depth and nuance in her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, moving logically from Thessaly’s wandering to the emotional climax of her performance. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bookstore and bar settings are vividly realized, contributing to the story’s mood and themes. Sensory details (whiskey, rejection letters) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor ("delayed fireworks"), symbolism (Voltaire’s dentures), and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, leaving a lingering warmth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The voice is distinct, and the handling of emotion is nuanced rather than stated. No signs of formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements feel cohesive and purposeful. The brevity enhances the impact, and the story lingers in the mind afterward.</comment>
