<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from con artist to redeemer is compelling and well-motivated. His "dishonestly honest" trait adds depth, and his actions align with his arc. Elena's reaction to his return subtly reinforces his redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with the yodel-song acting as a cohesive throughline. The detour feels slightly contrived, but the resolution is satisfying. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, with sensory details (morning mist, fireflies) enhancing immersion. The setting actively supports the theme of renewal and connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (sheet music as confession, song as healing). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically. Dialogue is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("viral antibody of memory"). Avoids clich√©s and AI-typical phrasing. The yodel twist is inventive and thematically grounded.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Creative fusion of whimsy and depth.</comment>
