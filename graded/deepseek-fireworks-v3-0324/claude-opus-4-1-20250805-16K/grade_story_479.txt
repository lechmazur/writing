<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and deeply woven into her character. Her "fruitless patience" and need to preserve the family ritual are compelling, with her glamorous undertaker persona adding a distinct, memorable voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the brass measuring tape as a powerful through-line. The word limit is used effectively, though the social media element feels slightly underdeveloped given its thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fusion of mortuary and digital worlds is masterful. Sensory details (cerulean paint, the brass tape's gleam) ground the ethereal tone, enhancing the mythic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (measurement as poetry) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the social media framing slightly dilutes its impact by modernizing the ritual’s mystique.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("golds that wept"). The handling of "jubilant remorse" is nuanced, though the term itself risks feeling contrived. Avoids cliché with inventive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and compelling, with elements serving its themes elegantly. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on legacy and artifice.</comment>
