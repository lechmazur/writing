<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The druid's fierce ambivalence and fear of sound are compellingly portrayed, though her sudden shift to laughter and speech could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is strong, and the 300-year silence/breaking it feels earned. Pacing is tight but not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The glacial orchard is vividly rendered, and the crevasse's symbolic weight elevates the atmosphere. Sensory details (clinking apples, humming ice) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (safety pin, crevasse) and subtext (silence as both burden and power). Ending resonates with thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The druid's voice and worldbuilding feel distinctly crafted, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered. The brevity serves the storyâ€™s intensity, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
