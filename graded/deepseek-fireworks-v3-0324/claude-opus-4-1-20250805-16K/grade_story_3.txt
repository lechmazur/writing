<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grimsby's surly yet wise demeanor is vividly portrayed, with consistent motivation and a distinct voice. His actions and dialogue reveal depth, though a tad more nuance in his backstory could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. Pacing is strong, though the resolution slightly rushes the magnate's acceptance of Grimsby's solution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The graveyard setting and autumnal atmosphere are masterfully evoked, with sensory details enhancing the eerie yet dignified tone. The setting deeply informs the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolism ("market wisdom" as cosmic truth). The ending resonates, and the prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity. A near-flawless execution of theme and craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The handling of "dignified chaos" and rope-divination feels fresh, though one or two phrases skirt predictability ("veil thinned").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply inventive story where every element serves the narrative. Leaves the reader pondering the interplay of human ambition and natural law. Only a hint of artifice in the magnate's swift departure.</comment>
