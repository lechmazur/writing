<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the postcards serving as a clear catalyst for Ezra's rebellion. The dismantling of the aviary is a logical and satisfying climax, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mechanical bird sanctuary is vividly rendered, with the contrast between its artificiality and Ezra’s organic memories heightening the emotional impact.
