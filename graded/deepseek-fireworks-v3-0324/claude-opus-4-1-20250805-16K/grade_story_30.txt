<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera Chen's motivation is clear and compelling, tied to her heritage and practical philosophy. Her actions align well with her gambler's instincts and telekinetic abilities, though some nuance in her voice could deepen further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from conflict to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the consortium's threat could use marginally more weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the tapestry and navigation room details enriching the atmosphere. Supernova light and whispered secrets enhance mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (dragons, dice) and layered themes (preservation vs. control) resonate strongly. Ending is satisfying, though the chorus of translation could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and avoided tropes. Emotional resonance is shown through actions (tapestry touch, bonsai) rather than stated. No AI-generic tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact about cultural preservation.</comment>
