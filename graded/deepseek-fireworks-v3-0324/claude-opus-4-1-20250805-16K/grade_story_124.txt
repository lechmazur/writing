<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s transformation from drifter to connected weaver is subtly compelling. His motivation is clear, and his actions align well with his traits, though his "skittish" nature could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and achieves a clear arc within the word limit. The loom’s role feels organic, but the solar storm backstory could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vividly rendered and contrasts beautifully with the loom’s warmth. Sensory details (moondust, recycled air) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (loom as Rosetta Stone) and subtext. The ending resonates, though the "summoning of grace" theme could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("orbit" as belonging) and nuanced emotion elevate this. Minor risk of over-poetic phrasing ("like starlight").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are masterfully woven. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting, reflective finish.</comment>
