<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keras' spinelessness is vividly portrayed and drives his actions, though his trembling knees feel slightly overplayed. His motivation to "hush the prophecy" is clear and consistent with his cowardice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the key's revelation and the mentor’s guidance forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the prophecy's resolution could be slightly more explicit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The map projection room and "hush after the wind" create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like "amber light" and "prism laughter" immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key as both trivial and profound) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s thematic resonance—fear as a navigational tool—is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "grandly trivial" motif and Keras' nuanced fear stand out. Only minor quibble: "luminous doubt" slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about uncharted inner horizons.</comment>
