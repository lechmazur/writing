<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sophia's motivation is clear and consistent; her intellectual curiosity and outsider status drive her actions believably. Her "voice" as an academic trapped in menial work adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical cause-and-effect chain from disillusionment to discovery. The pacing avoids feeling rushed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—autumnal decay, chalk dust, and fireflies create a haunting, tactile world that mirrors Sophia’s journey. Sensory details are precise and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft: the chalkboard as a symbol of erased potential, the postcards as fragments of collective memory. The ending is both emotionally resonant and thematically potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghost mathematics") and nuanced handling of disillusionment vs. rediscovered faith. Avoids clichés and AI tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterfully cohesive; every element serves the story’s deeper theme of reinventing faith. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
