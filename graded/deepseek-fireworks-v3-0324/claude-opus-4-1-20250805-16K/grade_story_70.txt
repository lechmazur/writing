<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scribe's transformation from rigidity to empathy is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His 'voice' is distinct, especially in his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from skepticism to revelation. The adhesive analysis drives the narrative logically, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (bottled moonlight, breathing plants) enhancing the eerie, transformative atmosphere. Graveyard and glass structure are brilliantly connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (light bulb as empathy, gravestones as seeds) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is resonant, and the prose style—poetic yet precise—amplifies the emotional impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively, with creative integration (e.g., adhesive as a narrative device). The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
