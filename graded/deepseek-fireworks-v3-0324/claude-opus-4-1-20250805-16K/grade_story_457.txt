<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus Chen is vividly drawn with clear motivation—his rebellion against corporate prophecy is both consistent and compelling. His "impersonally personal" cadence and use of the broken zipper pull as a symbol are nuanced strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the contradiction in folklore driving Marcus's actions. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution—his unzipped future—feels earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck is richly rendered, blending corporate artifice with cosmic wonder. Sensory details (the moth-shadows, the grating) deepen the atmosphere and align perfectly with Marcus’s subversion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—layered symbolism (zipper pull, nebula), sharp subtext about commodified futures, and a hauntingly open ending. The prose is precise yet evocative, with no wasted words.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The absurd solemnity and Elena Voss mythos feel fresh. Nuanced emotion (e.g., tourists’ disillusionment) is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking microcosm. The elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about unscripted futures.</comment>
