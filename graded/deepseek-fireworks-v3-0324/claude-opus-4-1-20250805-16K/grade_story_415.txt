<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation and backstory are clear, but her "synthetically organic" ability feels slightly underdeveloped. Her actions align with her established traits, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between rain trails and the amphitheater feels tenuous. The resolution is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though "Yodeling Valley" leans toward whimsy in an otherwise grounded tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but some metaphors (e.g., "fermented into resentment") verge on overworked. The ending resonates emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors, though "forgiveness' embrace" skirts clich√©. Nuanced emotion, but minor stylistic inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate despite constraints. Leaves a lingering thought, but some elements feel slightly contrived.</comment>
