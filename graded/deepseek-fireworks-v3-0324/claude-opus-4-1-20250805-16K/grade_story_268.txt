<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's subdued vigilante persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His use of the wooden bead and mirror reveals depth, though his "artfully clumsy" attribute could be more vividly shown.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the handler's flattery driving tension and Marcus's mirror method logically escalating the conflict. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, ending with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned hospital and screaming silence create a haunting atmosphere. The funhouse mirror and wooden bead are brilliantly integrated, enhancing the story's mood and thematic weight.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich subtext (justice as war's continuation). The mirror as a truth-revealing device is original and impactful. The ending lingers, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Marcus's emotional nuance and the fresh metaphor of distortion-as-truth stand out. No AI-generic phrasing or tropes detected.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished piece where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story resonates beyond its length.</comment>
