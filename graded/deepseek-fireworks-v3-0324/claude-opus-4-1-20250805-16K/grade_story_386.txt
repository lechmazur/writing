<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maera’s motivation and personality are vividly drawn, with clear consistency between her defiance, her past, and her use of the tablecloth. Her voice is distinct, though her dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with stellar alignment driving the climax logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original, with the lighthouse’s atomic hum and displaced time enhancing the mood. Sensory details (glowing threads, reactor hum) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tablecloth as map/legacy) and subtext (refugees weaving into a new timeline) elevate the narrative. Ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. Language is precise yet lyrical, with fresh metaphors ("borrowed dawns"). No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, and leaves a lingering impact of resilience.</comment>
