<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the plot with emotional weight. Her reverence for ancestors and defiance of oppression are well-conveyed, though her "earthy farmer" trait could be more integrated beyond the tractor detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each fold of dough advancing both the narrative and thematic payoff. Pacing is masterful for the word count, though the "celebrate" action feels slightly tacked on at the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The Arctic setting and aurora borealis are breathtakingly rendered, amplifying the story's magic realism. Sensory details (frozen tears, saffron's scent) immerse the reader. Only the platform's "effectively unique" isolation feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (scale measuring history, dough as archival medium). The ending thrums with emotional resonance, though the conflict with oppressive regimes could be less abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Brilliantly original premise with minimal clich√©. Only minor quibble: "hushed euphoria" occasionally slips into over-poetic phrasing ("star-drunk sky").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a cohesive whole. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a haunting, lyrical impression.</comment>
