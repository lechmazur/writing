<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's regret and motivation are deeply felt, but her "theoretically creative" attribute could be more vividly integrated into her actions beyond notebook sketches.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured, though the hidden library's mechanics verge on convenient; time distortion is handled well but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—frost patterns, waterfall library, and firework chemistry merge into a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Masterful emotional impact with layered symbolism (frost as music, leaves as catalysts). The ending’s thematic resolution is profound but risks slight sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original premise, though "subtle paths unfolding" feels abstract. Some metaphors (e.g., "curtain of time") edge toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and resonant, with elements serving the story's heart. The brevity feels deliberate, though the library's rules could be tighter.</comment>
