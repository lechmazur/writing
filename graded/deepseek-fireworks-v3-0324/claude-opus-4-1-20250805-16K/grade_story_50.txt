<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sister Margot's transformation from unconvinced missionary to conduit for magic is subtly and compellingly portrayed, though her initial doubts could be more vividly established to strengthen the arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s progression through the fork and piano echoes is elegantly coherent, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of her faith’s transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The glass desert and monarch butterfly create a haunting, immersive atmosphere, with sensory details (e.g., "geometric whispers that made her teeth ache") elevating the surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork as faith’s weight, butterfly as transcendence) and lyrical prose make the story resonate deeply, though the ending’s thematic punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—fresh metaphors ("faith's raw form before humans dressed it in doctrine") and a distinctive voice avoid cliché while maintaining emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements, though the brevity slightly underserves the concept’s full potential. Lingers beautifully with its final imagery.</comment>
