<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s reincarnated identity is woven seamlessly into his motivations, creating a compelling and unique character arc. His "tentative fierceness" is vividly portrayed and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the weather change and Dr. Chen's arrival serving as effective catalysts. The resolution feels earned, though slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Forgotten Recipe Library is evocative but underutilized. The goldfish tank and toy soldier enhance atmosphere, but sensory details could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (toy soldier, numbers) and subtext (tradition vs. care). The ending is satisfyingly defiant, though the playful cynicism occasionally clashes with darker themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Minimal clichés, though the psychiatrist’s role leans slightly predictable. Emotional resonance is nuanced and shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic depth beyond the plot.</comment>
