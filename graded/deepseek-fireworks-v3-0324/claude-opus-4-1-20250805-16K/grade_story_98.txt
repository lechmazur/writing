<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from fainthearted to assured is subtly but effectively portrayed, though his initial hesitation could be more vividly contrasted with his final resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each measurement advancing both the literal and thematic revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chamber and mundane outside world are masterfully juxtaposed, creating a rich atmosphere. Sensory details (candlelight, terrier's bark) are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (ruler, tapestry), subtext (security as perception), and a resonant ending. The theme of hidden-in-plain-sight wisdom is deftly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The ruler as a key to secrets is ingenious. Only minor quibble: "intimately distant" feels slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers long after reading. All elements serve the narrative seamlessly.</comment>
