<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's feral nature and motivation to embrace the unknown are clear, but her backstory could be more nuanced to deepen her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the newborn's cry and scale symbolizing the resistance. Pacing is excellent, though the code-word method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dandelion field and unfiltered perception create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (drifting seeds, brass scale) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (scale, seeds) and subtext about truth and control. The ending is poignant, though the dialogue absence is notable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but a few metaphors ("tiny ghosts") edge toward clich√©. Emotional resonance is strong, but minor tonal shifts occur.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about perception and freedom.</comment>
