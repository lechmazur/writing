<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and compelling; her literal interpretation of star maps sets her apart. Her actions align well with her desperate, scientific drive, though her "bright-eyed" trait could be more developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed, with logical cause-and-effect. The 400-word limit is well-managed, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—haunted lighthouse and post-war desolation merge seamlessly. Sensory details (blue electricity, ocean scent) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative prose with strong symbolism (Aquarius, phone key as conductor). Theme of extinction and hope lingers. Ending is satisfying yet open.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghosts like memories of rain"). Nuanced tension between logic and the supernatural.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. Brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A standout in thematic depth.</comment>
