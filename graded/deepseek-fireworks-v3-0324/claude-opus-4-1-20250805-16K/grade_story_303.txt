<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her role as a dreamer pilot. Her mourning is poignant and reveals her emotional depth, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spice rack's significance driving the narrative coherently. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the language exchange detour feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The interdimensional setting is vividly realized, with sensory details (the hum of the portal, the spice rack's texture) enhancing atmosphere and character motivation masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (spice rack as a map) and layered themes (grief, transformation). The ending is resonant and purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (cognitive coordinates as spices) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "dignified chaos" drifts toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and loss. Only minor refinements needed.</comment>
