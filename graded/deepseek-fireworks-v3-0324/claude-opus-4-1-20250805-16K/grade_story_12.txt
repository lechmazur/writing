<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's aloofness and Oliver's eager resignation are well-contrasted, with clear motivations rooted in past and present tensions. The cracked tile serves as a powerful symbol of their shared history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from anticipation to resolution. The kayaking simulator as a finale avoids cliché while reinforcing theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The futuristic mall feels underutilized; the bioluminescent details are evocative but don't deeply integrate with character or theme beyond surface aesthetics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor (cartography of the soul) and subtext. The ending’s inversion of expectations is both satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh phrasing ("eager resignation," "inconspicuously blatant"). Avoids AI-generic tropes, though the mall setting risks familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements. The kayaking motif elevates the story beyond a simple reunion, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
