<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the numbers and cards serving as clever narrative devices.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the synthetic brine and primordial soup creating a haunting atmosphere.

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The storytelling is exceptional, with rich symbolism (the missing joker, the noise between heartbeats) and a hauntingly minimalist style. The ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving room for interpretation. The theme of imperfection as liberation is brilliantly explored.</comment>
