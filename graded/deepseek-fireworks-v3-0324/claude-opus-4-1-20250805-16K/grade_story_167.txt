<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, but her internal conflict could be further nuanced. Her "dutiful scholar" trait aligns well with her actions, though some depth in her emotional stakes is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc. The temporal lock and wire coil drive the story effectively, though the resolution's mechanics could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting is vivid and immersive, perfectly complementing the story's temporal themes. Sensory details (humming pod, frosted glass) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (wire coil as rebellion) and subtext (time as illusion). The ending is resonant and thematically rich, leaving a lasting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and minimal clich√©s. The prose avoids AI pitfalls, though one or two phrases border on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and complete, with elements serving the narrative seamlessly. It lingers in the mind long after reading.</comment>
