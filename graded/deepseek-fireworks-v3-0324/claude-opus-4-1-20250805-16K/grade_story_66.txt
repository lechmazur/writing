<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the jigsaw puzzles and masks serving as effective metaphors for her journey. Pacing is strong, but the breakthrough with the ferns feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned facility and electromagnetic plant communication create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., cracked mirror, ceramic masks) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (carbonization, masks) and layered themes (belonging, redemption) elevate the prose. The ending is poignant, though the "green cathedral" metaphor borders on overripe.</comment>
