<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambassador Chen's transformation from reluctant exile to "keeper of broken things" is compelling and subtly revealed. Her use of the coathanger as both tool and metaphor for her evolving perspective is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and emotional resonance within tight constraints. Chen's arc—from punishment to purpose—is expertly paced, with debris patterns mirroring her internal growth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The orbital station setting is vividly realized, with Earth's curve and tumbling debris creating a haunting backdrop. Sensory details (spilled coffee, rustling postcards) ground the cosmic scale in intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (debris as regrets, postcards as redemption). The ending’s thematic payoff—"failure as another kind of beginning"—elevates the narrative beyond its modest word count.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strikingly original metaphors (coathanger as baton, solar panel as prayer wheel) avoid cliché. Chen’s voice feels distinctly human, balancing diplomatic precision with poetic insight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A masterclass in constrained storytelling. Every element serves the central theme of fractured things finding new orbits, leaving the reader with lingering resonance.</comment>
