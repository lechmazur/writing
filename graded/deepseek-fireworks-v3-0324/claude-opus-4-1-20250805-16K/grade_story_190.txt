<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s meticulous impulsiveness and detached enthusiasm are compelling, but his motivation to master empathy without feeling it could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the butterfly’s use and the painter’s confession driving the narrative. Pacing is strong, but the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drought center’s dual purpose is brilliantly atmospheric, and sensory details (glass, butterfly resonance) immerse the reader. The setting enhances the story’s eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (butterfly as sheet music) and subtext (emotional drought). The ending lingers, though Marcus’s emotional detachment slightly mutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original—no tropes, fresh metaphors. The "enthusiastic apathy" tone is distinct, and the story avoids AI pitfalls like over-formality or abrupt jumps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. The elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a haunting question about empathy’s cost.</comment>
