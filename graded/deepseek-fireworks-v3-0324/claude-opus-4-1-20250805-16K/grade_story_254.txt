<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marcus's humorless persona and the inkwell reveal deep layers of contradiction and unresolved maternal expectations. His motivation is clear, but the resolution slightly rushes his epiphany.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently, with the daydream loops effectively driving Marcus's internal conflict. The ending resolves cleanly, though the wilderness's role in the climax feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The deserted playground and encroaching wilderness create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. The inkwell's connection to the setting is subtle but potent, though sensory details could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (inkwell as absence, comedy as silence) and subtext. The ending is deeply satisfying, and the thematic exploration of emptiness as a gift elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (Betelgeuse's breath as bottled silence). Avoids clich√©s, though the "wrong son" line verges on melodrama. Nuanced emotional handling throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity, with each element serving the story's existential meditation. Leaves a lingering resonance about the nature of art and absence.</comment>
