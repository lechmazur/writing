<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlene's grief-fueled defiance is vividly portrayed; her motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply human, elevating her beyond a mere archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s tight structure balances mystery and ritual beautifully; cause/effect is subtle but logical, though the word limit slightly truncates the forge’s payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fog and forge are inseparable from the story’s soul—sensory details (phantom apples, warm chimneys) create an atmosphere thick with longing and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("devotion wearing Sunday clothes backwards"); the ending lingers with subtext about mortal audacity vs. divine indifference.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality; the postcards and forge ritual subvert tropes of grief. Language is vivid but never purple, with fresh similes ("like teaching a fish to waltz").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette; the brevity feels deliberate, and the interplay of elements (fog, postcards, forge) suggests mythic depth.</comment>
