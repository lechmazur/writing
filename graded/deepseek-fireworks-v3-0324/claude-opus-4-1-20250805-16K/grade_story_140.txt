<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus's tortured past and protective nature are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct 'voice.' His reaction to the doll reveals depth, though his transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the encounter and doll's revelation, though the tight word limit slightly truncates the arc. Pacing is strong, but the climax could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—dust motes like acrobats, cosmic doll cracks—but the planetarium's connection to the circus could be tighter. Atmosphere is hauntingly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (cosmic symbolism, cracked smiles) and layered subtext elevate this. The ending is purposeful, though Marcus's laughter feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and originality shine, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of guilt and transformation, though the "suspiciously sweet" motif borders on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite constraints. Leaves a lingering question about destiny versus choice. Style supports clarity without sacrificing depth.</comment>
