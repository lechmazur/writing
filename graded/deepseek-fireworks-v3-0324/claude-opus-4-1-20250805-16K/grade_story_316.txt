<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thalia's seraphic skill and timid nature are richly developed, and her motivation to honor Marcus's promise is compelling and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's cryptic scoreboard guiding the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple-commune setting is vividly realized, blending decay and resilience. Sensory details (looms, fluorescent ghosts) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (ribbons as memories) and emotional resonance. The ending satisfies while leaving room for reflection. Minimal dialogue, but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "scattered harmony"), nuanced emotion, and no clich√©s. Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyrical clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Length feels deliberate, with lingering impact.</comment>
