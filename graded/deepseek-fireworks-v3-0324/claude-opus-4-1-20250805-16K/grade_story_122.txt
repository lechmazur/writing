<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestra's cyber-templar identity and her "patiently frantic" demeanor create a compelling tension between digital omnipotence and visceral vulnerability, though her internal conflict could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s recursive destruction of the storm is brilliantly executed, with tight cause-and-effect logic, though the brevity slightly rushes the emotional payoff of her revelation.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky burial site and prismatic refraction merge into a haunting, hyper-sensory atmosphere—every detail (vultures, cracked leather, neural warnings) reinforces the collision of worlds.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (bridle as conduit, storm as recursive conflict) and layered subtext ("safety was always an illusion"). The euphoric climax and thematic resolution are razor-sharp.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startlingly original—no clichés, no stale metaphors. The cyber-templar’s fusion of tech and mysticism feels fresh, and the prose avoids AI-generic pitfalls with vivid, idiosyncratic phrasing.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the brief length serving the story’s intensity. Leaves a lingering awe at the cost of transcendence.</comment>
