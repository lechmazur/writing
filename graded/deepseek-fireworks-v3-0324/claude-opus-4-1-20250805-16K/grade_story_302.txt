<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Verse’s character is vividly defined—her motivation (rejecting melody to counter chaos) is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her distinct voice and backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Verse’s performance driving the narrative forward logically. The ending is satisfying, though the word limit slightly rushes the thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk airship setting is immersive and enhances the dissonant tone. Sensory details (oil-stained manuscript, swaying chandelier) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and subtext. The ending’s off-beat applause lingers, reinforcing the theme of embracing discord.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("kiss the horizon of madness") and nuanced emotion. No AI-generated stiffness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with a provocative idea: power in dissonance.</comment>
