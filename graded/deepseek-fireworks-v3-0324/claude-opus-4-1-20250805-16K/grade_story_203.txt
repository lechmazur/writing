<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's stage fright and exorcist role are well-integrated, revealing depth through her trembling hands and defiance. However, her transition from fear to courage could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from tension to resolution. Pacing is excellent, though the demon's manifestation could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris field and toy assembly line create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., starlight on the collar, flower scents) are expertly deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (toys as vessels, flowers as Earth magic) and a resonant theme of inherited courage elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"). No clich√©s; emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story organically. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression of hope crafted from remnants.</comment>
