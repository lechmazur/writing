<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's introverted empathy is well-utilized, driving her actions and reactions with consistency. Her motivation to champion the outcasts feels organic, though her "drowsy enthusiasm" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly wound around the marionette's reassembly, with clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the pirate backstory feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout and its haunting atmosphere are brilliantly rendered, with sensory details (resonating starfish, metallic corridors) enhancing the cosmic-mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (starfish, marionette) and subtext (patience vs. human haste). The ending lingers with thematic weight, though the journal's inclusion verges on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept, avoiding clich√©s. The "mountain wisdom" metaphor is fresh, though "drowsy enthusiasm" slightly disrupts stylistic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant thematic echoes.</comment>
