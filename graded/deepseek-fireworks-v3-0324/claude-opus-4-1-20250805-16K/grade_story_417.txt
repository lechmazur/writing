<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cornelius's zealotry and unraveling sanity are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His transition from certainty to vulnerability is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The bottle cap’s revelation and Cornelius’s shift are effectively linked.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of Victorian parlor and jungle is masterfully atmospheric, with sensory details ("steamed like souls escaping purgatory") heightening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottle cap as manufactured certainty) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the final thematic punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Only minor stiffness in phrases like "cosmic joke" slightly detracts from otherwise nuanced prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the brevity slightly undermines thematic depth. The story lingers, though, with its absurdity and existential tension.</comment>
