<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Saffron's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her heritage, her secretive nature adds intrigue, and her actions feel authentic to her quest. Marcus complements her well, though his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds elegantly within the tight word limit, with crisp cause-and-effect logic. The discovery of the doodles and Marcus's reveal are paced well, though the kiss resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (canaries, rusted aviary) enhancing the mood. The setting mirrors Saffron’s fractured dreams beautifully, and the monsoon simile ties to her past.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (colonial resistance, cultural reclamation) elevates the story. Literary devices (symbolism of broken wings, crayon-as-cipher) are deftly used. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (saffron suspended in oil) and nuanced emotion (revolution-star anise kiss) avoid cliché. The child’s-art-as-rebellion twist is original. Minor quibble: "electric" feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically into a cohesive whole. The length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic weight (heritage, defiance). A standout in its originality and execution.</comment>
