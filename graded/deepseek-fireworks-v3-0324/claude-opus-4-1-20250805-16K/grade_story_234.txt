<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaito's motivations are deeply explored, and his "faithfully unfaithful" nature is a compelling paradox that drives his journey. His late-bloomer status adds depth, though his "gentle swordsman" trait could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The sundial revelation ties everything together elegantly, though the time constraint (90 minutes) feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The museum setting is atmospheric and thematically resonant. The dinosaur skeletons and nighttime ambiance enhance the story's contemplative tone, though sensory details outside visuals could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (matchbox, sundial) and layered themes (universal flow vs. control). The ending is profound, though Elena's dialogue occasionally veers into exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of paleontology and swordsmanship feels fresh, though the "brusque affection" tone isn't always consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply resonant story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
