<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Enkidu's motivations are clear and consistent, blending sentimentality with spontaneous courage, though his 'voice' could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and effective pacing. The climax and resolution feel earned, though the word limit slightly truncates emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details (jade hairpin, cuneiform tablets) deepening immersion. Setting and timeframe harmonize perfectly with the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and subtext (justice vs. chaos). Symbolism (hairpin, anchor) elevates the narrative. Ending is satisfying but slightly overt in its moralizing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Nuanced handling of emotion, though some phrasing edges toward over-formality ("chaos had taught him his greatest lesson").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with creative integration of elements. Lingers on the theme of justice’s cost, though brevity limits full emotional resonance.</comment>
