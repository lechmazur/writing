<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenzo's arrogance and internal conflict are sharply drawn, with his transformation subtly foreshadowed. His doubt under confidence is revealed through precise, sparing dialogue and gesture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and emotional weight within constraints. The tapestry's revelation and Kenzo's shift feel earned, though the wedding context is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—the courtyard's quiet intensity mirrors Kenzo’s turmoil. Sensory details (e.g., "blade sang," "weathered fingers") deepen immersion without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship. The phoenix metaphor and "dead brush" imagery resonate. Subtext about sacrifice and rebirth elevates the story beyond its surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and hauntingly fresh. Avoids clichés (e.g., the grandmother’s legacy isn’t sentimentalized). Nuanced handling of "harsh tenderness" stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless microcosm. Every element serves the theme. The ending lingers, balancing resolution with open-ended transformation.</comment>
