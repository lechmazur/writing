<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard's mild temperament and refusal of promotion reveal a nuanced, consistent character. His "poetically bland" curiosity and methodical competence are well-integrated, though his motivations could be slightly more explicit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the cats' misdirection and the anvil's discovery creating a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could be slightly more defined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The black hole resort is vividly realized, with gravitational corridors and quantum-entangled cats enhancing the surreal atmosphere. Sensory details ("teeth ache with savage bliss") are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (infinity in repetition, management's illusions) and striking metaphors ("fabric bunch and smooth like silk"). The ending lingers, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of cosmic scale and mundane duty feels fresh, and the prose is precise without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative, not vice versa. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
