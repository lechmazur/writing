<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation is crystal clear and deeply intertwined with her cunning, subversive nature. Her 'voice' is distinct, and her actions reveal a calculated, almost predatory intellect.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from revelation to transformation. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the portal's mechanics could benefit from slightly more scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The canyon and its shifting carvings are brilliantly evoked, merging mysticism with menace. The pickled starfruit motif adds a unique, unsettling layer to the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the mirror, the tag) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly purposeful, and the prose is razor-sharp, blending irony with cosmic grandeur.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Startlingly original. No clich√©s, no predictable beats. The concept of 'harvesting grace' through deception feels wholly fresh, and the prose avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity serves the story's mythic quality, and the lingering question of Margaret's true fate is masterful.</comment>
