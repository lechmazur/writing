<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Melody's transformation from perfectionist to slapdash bard is vivid and well-motivated, rooted in her near-death experience. Her family's dynamic adds depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured around the annual ritual, with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is strong, though the earthquake backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The tectonic setting is brilliantly evocative, merging geology with emotional stakes. Sensory details (earth's rumbles, hourglass sand) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (hourglass, crooked doorplate) and subtext about imperfection. The ending resonates, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "melancholic glee" leans slightly toward stated emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven. The short length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on survival and imperfection.</comment>
