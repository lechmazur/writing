<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brother Tide's motivation is compelling and nuanced, with clear alignment between his actions and his tragic, self-aware villainy. His voice is distinct, though deeper exploration of his zealotry could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the consolidation of resistance cells feels slightly underexplored. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and poetic, with the coral reef city and nature walks enhancing the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the dolphin, reversed echoes) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the theme of moral duality is masterfully woven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply resonant story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
