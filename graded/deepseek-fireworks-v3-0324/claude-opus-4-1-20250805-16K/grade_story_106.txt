<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from sullen resignation to inspired purpose is compelling and well-articulated. His motivation is clear, but his "objectively biased" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the stamps and quilt serving as elegant catalysts for Marcus's revelation. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The drowned power station is vividly rendered, with sensory details (amber light, corroded turbines) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and object are meaningfully interconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as vanished worlds, quilt as map) elevates the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "erasing boundaries" could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though "borrowed valor" feels slightly forced. Metaphors (e.g., "drowned cathedral of industry") are fresh and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive and haunting story that lingers. The elements serve the narrative, not vice versa, and the brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
