<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The scarecrow's apathy and duty-bound nature are compelling, but its 'voice' lacks deeper emotional nuance. The woman's urgency contrasts well, though her backstory feels thinly sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly wound, with dimensional collapse as a clear catalyst. Pacing excels despite brevity, though the scarecrow's sudden shift from apathy to action could use more groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strikingly original fusion of virtual and mythic realms. Data-wheat and fossilized giant create a haunting, cohesive surrealism. Sensory details (glowing furrows, pixel-to-straw transitions) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fan as dimensional map, oath as cosmic contract) elevates the narrative. Ending is both satisfying and destabilizingâ€”subtext about cyclical destruction lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Defies tropes with its bleakly inventive worldbuilding. Only flaw: "fervent apathy" slightly over-explains the scarecrow's tone instead of trusting the prose to convey it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements interlock like a puzzle; brevity feels intentional. The fossilized giant as anchor and the fan as key are particularly inspired choices.</comment>
