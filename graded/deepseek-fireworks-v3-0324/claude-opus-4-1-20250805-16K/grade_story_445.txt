<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nomad's drowsy, otherworldly nature and his relationship with Silva are compelling, but his fatigue occasionally overshadows deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the barbells and Silva’s departure serving as elegant pivots. The word count is used efficiently, though the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The disguise room and barbells create a rich, mystical atmosphere. The "spiritually material" energy is vividly implied but not overexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional symbolism (barbells as doorways) and thematic depth (pride vs. humility). The prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the nomad’s drowsiness risks becoming a repetitive crutch. Silva’s arc feels genuinely human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection without abruptness.</comment>
