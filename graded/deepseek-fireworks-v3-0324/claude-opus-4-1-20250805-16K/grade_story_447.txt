<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation is compelling and consistent; her defiance and journalistic duty are well-integrated with her prophetic gift, giving her depth and distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the magical realism element risks feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with the "amber prison" and steam prophecies enhancing mood and thematic resonance. Sensory details (e.g., thyme, threadbare fabric) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—layered symbolism (the ear, the soup), emotional weight, and a satisfying arc. The theme of communal healing through radical honesty is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh and original; avoids clichés. The stuffed ear as a talisman and prophecies in steam are inventive. Nuanced emotion and subtext elevate it beyond generic templates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deliberate vignette. Elements serve the story masterfully, leaving a lingering impact. The brevity feels purposeful, not constrained.</comment>
