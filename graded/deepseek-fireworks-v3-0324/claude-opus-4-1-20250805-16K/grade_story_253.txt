<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marcus's character is vividly drawn, with his politeness and silence serving as distinct traits that align seamlessly with his motivations and actions. His decision to decline time manipulation reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the harp and chip driving the narrative logically. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The electronic wilderness refuge is immersive and original, with sensory details (harp's discord, server hum) enhancing the atmosphere. The classroom-bell silence adds poetic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (harp as time-key) and subtext (betrayal vs. wisdom). The ending lingers, and the prose elevates the story beyond its speculative conceit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("fragments of binary") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©. Only minor stiffness in "proud humility" phrasing slightly mars the originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact vignette. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving thematic resonance.</comment>
