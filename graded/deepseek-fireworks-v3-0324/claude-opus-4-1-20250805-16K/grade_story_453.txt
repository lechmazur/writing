<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hollis is vividly realized—his foolhardy nature and creative curiosity drive the narrative. His motivation (decoding the world's logic) is clear and compelling, though a hint of deeper personal stakes could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot unfolds organically within constraints, with a satisfying arc from observation to revelation. Pacing is tight but not rushed, though the Council's decree feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding—the snow globe's artificial cosmos is rich with sensory detail and symbolic weight. Atmosphere and setting are inseparable from the story's core themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Hauntingly original, with layered metaphors (seasons as moods, globe as meditation). The ending lingers, though the confessional tapes could be more integrated into the climax for deeper impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly fresh voice; no clichés or AI tells. The plastic lid as divination tool and the meditation meta-concept are revelatory. Only minor quibble: "detached devotion" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless microcosm of ideas. The length feels intentional, leaving room for reader reflection. Only the Council's role feels underexplored for full cohesion.</comment>
