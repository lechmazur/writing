<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized with a distinct voice and motivation; his detachment and poetic nature are seamlessly integrated into his actions and decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the map's discovery driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The menagerie's atmosphere is richly rendered, blending mundane and magical with precision. Sensory details (e.g., Temporal's purring, the map's texture) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (the map's tear, the blanket as "soft armor") and subtext. The ending lingers, balancing ambiguity with emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("grinding gears wrapped in velvet"). Avoids clich√©s and maintains nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically rich whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
