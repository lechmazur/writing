<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear and compelling, his actions align with his role as a collector and boundary-breaker. His "expectantly resigned" demeanor adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc—Marlowe's heist-like restoration of the nectar—while maintaining coherence and pacing despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world is exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (crystalline combs, golden nectar) and atmosphere ("ethereal grit") amplifying the story's mythic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (symbolism of dolls, star paths) and layered meaning (creation before gods). The ending is both triumphant and hauntingly contemplative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The prose is purposeful, and the fusion of elements (carnival cane, sentient dolls) feels inventive rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically resonant tale that lingers. The brevity serves the mythic tone, and every element enhances the narrative.</comment>
