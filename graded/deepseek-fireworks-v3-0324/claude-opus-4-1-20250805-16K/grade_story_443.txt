<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the seeds, manuscript, and springs forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, with no rushed or disjointed moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cave library is immersive and evocative, with luminescent vines and crumbling volumes enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (crystalline silence, warm manuscript) deepen the mood.</comment>
