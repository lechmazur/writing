<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's underachieving mage persona is compellingly tied to his heritage, and his shift from frustration to realization is well-executed. His motivation is clear and aligns with his actions, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with logical cause-and-effect. The misdelivered packages and the doll head effectively drive the narrative forward, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland setting is evocative and deeply intertwined with the story's themes. Sensory details (e.g., rusted hulk, purple flashes) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional and thematic impact. The reveal of Marcus's heritage is satisfying, and the use of stellar manipulation as misaligned magic is a brilliant twist. Literary devices (e.g., symbolism of the doll head) are effective.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of Earth-bound magic being a limitation rather than a failure is inventive. Some phrasing ("bored excitement") feels slightly contrived.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious despite word constraints. The story lingers, raising questions about heritage and destiny. Elements serve the narrative rather than feeling imposed.</comment>
