<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to outshine her reflection is compelling and subtly woven into her actions and the quantum beach's nature, though her solitude could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is masterful, with the quantum beach and demolition countdown creating tension. Pacing is tight, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The quantum beach is a stunning, immersive setting with vivid sensory details (liquid light, shifting sand). Atmosphere perfectly aligns with the corroded-rapture tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (leaf-map, reflections) and layered themes of authenticity elevate the story. Ending is hauntingly purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (chlorophyll veins, liquid light). Minimal clich√© reliance, though "spark of invention" feels slightly generic for such a surreal world.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly; quantum physics and familial ritual coexist without dissonance. Lingers in the mind like a half-remembered dream.</comment>
