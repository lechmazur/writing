<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's late-blooming heroism and motivation are clear and layered, but her "softly militant" attribute could be more deeply integrated into her actions and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, though the transition from carrots to spyglass feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and dying cityscape are vividly rendered, but the post-apocalyptic setting could push further into uniqueness. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stars as compost, spyglass as revelation) and haunting subtext. The ending lingers with purpose and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though "gravity of loss" edges toward the familiar. No AI artifice detectedâ€”emotions feel human and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The length feels deliberate, and the story resonates beyond its words.</comment>
