<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus is vividly rendered, with his physicality and emotional depth harmonizing well. His motivation is clear, though his "docile bruiser" trait could be more consistently showcased.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with each beat serving the central mystery. The twist about the baton's true function is earned, though the drummers' role feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is a masterclass in atmospheric tension, with sensory details (steamed glass, snapping plants) elevating the dread. The setting feels inseparable from the story’s soul.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (music as language, plants as memory) and emotional resonance. The ending is hauntingly lyrical, though the drummers’ narrative function could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and bold, avoiding clichés through inventive combinations (e.g., bruiser-as-conductor). Minor nitpicks: "brash tenderness" wobbles in execution, and the map feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious gem that transcends its constraints. The word limit feels like a strength, concentrating its mythic power. Leaves the reader humming with its rhythm.</comment>
