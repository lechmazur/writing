<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's detachment is clear and consistent, shaping her actions and worldview. Her "zany" nature is subtly shown through her perspective rather than overtly stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nonlinear time element and fragmented call logs create a coherent yet dreamlike plot structure. Pacing is deliberate, with a clear arc despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric immersion. The abandoned subway tunnels and folded time are evocatively rendered, with sensory details (sparks, dust, echoes) amplifying the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (phone cases as fossils, chandelier as monument) and subtext. The ending lingers, leaving room for reflection on connection and detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of "empty abundance" and the archaeologist-of-the-present angle feel fresh and inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Every element serves the theme, and the brevity feels deliberate rather than restrictive.</comment>
