<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaia's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her heritage, blending rebellion with ancestral duty. Her distinct voice and actions are consistent with her mystical profession and internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from tension to resolution. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the cause-effect logic (voices → tattoo ritual) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and thematically resonant, with volcanic glass walls and lava tubes enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (humming needles, ash-infused ink) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (living sigils, star maps) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, blending theme and character growth seamlessly. Subtext about evolving tradition is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The handling of emotion is nuanced (e.g., ancestral voices as both burden and guide). Language is vivid but purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering thematic impact ("Mahina as a state of being").</comment>
