<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sheriff Mae Holloway’s grief and rebellion are vividly portrayed, with her actions and motivations deeply rooted in the loss of her daughter. The tarnished chain serves as a potent symbol, revealing her emotional depth and resolve. Her "ghostly resolve" feels authentic, though the small-town sheriff aspect could be more integrated.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is coherent, moving from grief to quiet defiance. The tight word limit is well-managed, with a clear arc. The rebellion against sorrow is effectively framed through scientific poetry, though some transitions between introspection and action could be smoother.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and midday lull create an evocative, immersive setting. The interplay of celestial science and mourning poetry enhances Mae’s emotional journey. Sensory details like the chain’s clink and the telescope’s daylight use strengthen the atmosphere.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) and emotional depth. The ending is satisfying, weaving grief into duty. The theme of "echoing quiet" resonates, though it occasionally leans into abstraction. Shows rather than tells Mae’s transformation.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh imagery (e.g., "The Mathematics of Mourning"). Genuine emotional resonance, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The blend of astrophysics and grief feels original, but the "ghostly resolve" tone slightly disrupts consistency.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant narrative where elements serve the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on grief’s quiet rebellion. Creative and thoughtful, though the sheriff role could be more central.</comment>
