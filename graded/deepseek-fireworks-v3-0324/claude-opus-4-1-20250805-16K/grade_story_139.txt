<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's stubbornness is vividly portrayed through his actions and reflections, particularly in his choice of compassion over vengeance. His motivation is clear and deeply integrated into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from nightmare to resolution. The flute's role as both curse and key is logically executed, though the pacing feels slightly rushed near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The aerial gondola and mountain mist create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "metallic hymn" of cables and frost on glass enhance the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flute as a timeline, tooth marks as a lock) and a resonant theme of forgiveness elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of a "dark reflection" sending a cursed flute through time feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
