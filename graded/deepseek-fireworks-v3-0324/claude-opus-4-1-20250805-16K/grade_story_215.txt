<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Marcus is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct internal conflict. His "inwardly social" nature contrasts effectively with his reserved exterior, but his transformation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with puzzles and dance lessons serving as clever, coherent devices. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the quantum-lock reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is immersive and eerie, with dance lessons adding a surreal layer. Sensory details (worn postcard, waltz music) deepen the atmosphere masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (postcards as confessions, dances as metaphors) elevates the narrative. The ending resonates deeply, though Dr. Chen’s tonal shift could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fusion of exorcism and quantum physics is daring, though some phrasing ("coy aggression") leans slightly toward artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the theme. The length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with lingering questions about faith and science.</comment>
