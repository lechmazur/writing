<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's dejection and millennia-spanning failures are clear, but his transition to guardian of memory feels slightly rushed. The silent vow's revelation is powerful, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the trident prong's resonance and the thirteenth clock strike driving the climax effectively. The resolution ties back elegantly to the beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall and "sacred disorder" atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (phosphorescent algae, tolling bell) deepening immersion. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism (constellations, the prong) and emotional weight. The ending resonates, though the theme of "deepening horizons" could be more explicitly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but "normally abnormal" and "deepening horizons" verge on abstraction. The knight's arc avoids cliché, but some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of love transcending time.</comment>
