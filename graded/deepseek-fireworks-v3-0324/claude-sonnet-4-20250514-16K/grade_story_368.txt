<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's streetwise instincts and transformation are compelling, but her shift to "gardener of impossible things" feels slightly abrupt, needing more nuanced buildup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight, but the time distortion ("three days or centuries") could be grounded more concretely to avoid confusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details and atmosphere; the temple's paradoxes are vividly immersive, though the "unwritten calendar" could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext, though the ending's thematic resolution leans slightly didactic. The brooch's voice is a standout device.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, but "confident uncertainty" risks becoming a contrived motif. The orchard's contradictions are brilliantly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, though the tight word limit slightly strains the character's transformation. Leaves a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
