<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent, blending quiet fury with meticulous patience. His 'voice' is distinct, though deeper exploration of his past could strengthen emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect logic is impeccable, with a satisfying arc. Pacing is tight yet unhurried, though the climax (erasing the ledger) could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and marsh setting are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details that elevate the atmosphere. The tone contrasts beautifully with Marcus's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fireflies as approval, hydrolysis as purification) and layered themes (restoration vs. erasure) make this story resonate. The ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—no tropes or clichés. The "unbecoming" metaphor feels fresh, and Marcus's obsession avoids melodrama. Prose is precise yet evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect fusion of elements into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. The story’s depth belies its length.</comment>
