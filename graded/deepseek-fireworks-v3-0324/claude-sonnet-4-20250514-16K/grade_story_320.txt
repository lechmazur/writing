<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's character is sharply defined, with her "passionate disinterest" and reluctant acceptance of her role providing depth. Her motivation is clear and consistent, though her emotional repression could be explored further for nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The parallel timelines concept is well-handled, but the social media device disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater city market is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the eerie, decaying mood. The setting's fusion with timeline chaos is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (regret as "acid rain") and symbolism (sinking photographs). The ending resonates, though the social media intrusion slightly weakens the tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The "echo of regret" concept is fresh, though the underwater setting risks feeling gimmicky without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling despite complexity. The word limit feels intentional, though some elements (social media) detract from the story’s elegance.</comment>
