<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly portrayed with clear, consistent motivation, and his "earnestly frivolous" nature shines through his actions and theories. The kaleidoscope and his methods reveal deep layers about his past and psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the labyrinth and weddings serving as clever, cohesive metaphors. The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, though the confetti-coded proposals demand a slight suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth and floating lanterns create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (shifting shadows, cracked mirrors) enhance the mood and tie elegantly to Marcus's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (kaleidoscope as fractured wisdom) and thematic depth. The ending is poignant and thought-provoking, with a style that balances lyricism and precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of political exile, weddings, and geometry feels fresh. Nuanced emotions and subtext elevate it beyond typical AI-generated prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve a purpose. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on power and perception.</comment>
