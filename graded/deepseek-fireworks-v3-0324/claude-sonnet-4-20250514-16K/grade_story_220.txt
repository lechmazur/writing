<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's aloofness and odd predictability are well-developed, but his sudden shift to purposefulness feels slightly rushed. Elena's logbook effectively reveals his deeper connection to the port's history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven with clear cause-and-effect, though the discovery of the logbook's significance progresses almost too conveniently. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, with the labyrinthine containers serving as both physical and metaphorical obstacles. The "wounded season" atmosphere enhances the thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (containers as control, channels as suppressed truth) is layered and impactful. The ending is satisfying, though Marcus's transformation could use more subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in its blend of maritime archaeology and corporate critique, though some phrases ("innovative nostalgia") verge on overworked. Avoids clich√© but risks pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the logbook as the linchpin. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of reclaiming history lingers effectively.</comment>
