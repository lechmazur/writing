<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's detachment and meticulousness are convincingly portrayed, with his motivation (escape from digital oppression) clear and consistent. His use of brewing as both craft and rebellion reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's biochemical rebellion driving the narrative logically toward its poignant climax. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned circus tent and analog-digital transition are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (e.g., "dried blood" canvas, "feral elegance" of brewing) deepening the dystopian atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fading photograph, coded lullabies) and subtext (loss vs. freedom) elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly resonant, with prose that balances lyricism and precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of brewing, nursery rhymes, and neural rebellion feels fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., "savage grace" smile) avoid AI-generic tones.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful microcosm of rebellion. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity amplifies its thematic weight. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
