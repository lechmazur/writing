However, Marcus's transition from carefree gambler to serious investigator could use more narrative support.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains tension, but the brevity leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. The resolution feels slightly rushed given the weight of the mystery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop and unwatched videotapes create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like "dust like forgotten promises" enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (symbolism in the blueprint fragment, videotapes as lost innocence) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "hammered repose" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of emotion and fresh metaphors elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling despite tight word count. Elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering thematic weight about inherited legacies.</comment>
