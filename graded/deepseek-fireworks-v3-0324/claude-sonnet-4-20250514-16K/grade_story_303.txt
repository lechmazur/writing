<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot unfolds coherently within the tight word limit, with a clear arc from introduction to resolution. The language exchange event drives the narrative effectively, though some transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The interdimensional portal setting is richly evocative, with sensory details like the spice rack's essence-memories enhancing immersion. The tone of 'dignified chaos' complements the worldbuilding perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and literary craft, using metaphors (spice jars as memory vessels) and subtext (universality of grief) to profound effect. The ending is satisfying and layered.</comment>
