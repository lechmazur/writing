<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's sincerity and exhaustion are palpable, and his motivation to combat cynicism is clear. However, his "dream-walker" aspect could be more deeply explored to enhance his distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, though the resolution via dream-weaving feels slightly rushed. The pacing balances urgency and introspection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sanctuary's broken yet functional looms and the ash-covered dream field create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (charred paper, humming looms) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (calendar, ashes, golden thread) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates with thematic depth, though the dialogue could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors ("dysfunctionally functional rhythm"). Minor AI-like phrasing in Marcus's introspection, but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about hope's resilience.</comment>
