<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Joaquín's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "diligently whimsical" attribute subtly shapes his rituals and reactions, though slightly more depth in his inner conflict could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. The pacing balances urgency and reflection well within the word limit, though the transition to ghostly intervention could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The blending of ancient and modern settings is masterful, reinforced by vivid sensory details (copal, marigolds) and a haunting atmosphere. The fence line as a liminal space is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (magnifying glass as a bridge), layered themes (redemption, cultural preservation), and a resonant ending. The prose occasionally verges on ornate but remains purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The Nahuatl apologies and "kindrelize" concept stand out. Minor nitpicks: "raucous silence" feels slightly forced, and María's redemption could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of assigned elements. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. A near-flawless balance of constraints and creativity.</comment>
