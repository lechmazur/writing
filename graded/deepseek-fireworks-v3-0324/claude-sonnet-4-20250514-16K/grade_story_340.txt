<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Esperanza's pride and feistiness are well-integrated, but her internal conflict could be sharper. Her motivation is clear but slightly overshadowed by the external plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed in resolution. The connection between the bridge collapse and the spell’s revelation is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the word limit feels intentional. The story lingers but could delve deeper into thematic resonance.</comment>
