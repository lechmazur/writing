<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and nuanced, balancing duty and compassion. Her actions align with her inner conflict, and her 'voice' is distinct through subtle details like the stuck 'E' key.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coherent, with the bus ride and salt mine arrival serving as effective framing devices. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution might benefit from slightly more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is evocatively rendered, with sensory details (crystalline walls, laughter) enhancing atmosphere. The starlings' murmuration mirrors the thematic tension beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the key, starlings) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of collective adaptation resonates deeply. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "joyfully tragic" attribute and "boldly timid" tone feel fresh. Metaphors (living calligraphy, evolutionary wisdom) are inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense vignette. The brevity feels deliberate, and the combination of elements (key, birds, mine) is ingenious. Leaves a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
