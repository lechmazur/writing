<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear (mapping trade routes) and her actions align with her role as a wandering orchardist. Her "trustworthy" attribute is subtly shown through her reputation and interactions with the phantom hand, though deeper nuance in her voice could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the phantom hand's guidance and the reclaiming of maps driving the narrative efficiently. The multiversal shift at the end resolves the arc beautifully within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is brilliantly evoked with sensory details (barnacle-crusted walls, kelp-like maps). The multiverse setting enhances the atmosphere, merging grit with cosmic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (dried leaves as universes, phantom hand as hope) and thematic depth. The ending resonates emotionally, tying wisdom, trade, and rebirth together with lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The multiversal orchardist premise is fresh, and the prose avoids excess ornamentation while remaining vivid. Minor quibble: "water rushed through her lungs without drowning her" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on interconnectedness and resilience.</comment>
