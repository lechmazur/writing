<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jeremiah's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vividly rendered, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His reactions to the dice and walls reveal depth, though his past could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dice and walls driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory and café merge seamlessly, creating a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (brass gears, hissing steam) elevate the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (dice, walls) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally, and the theme of fate is explored with nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "small graves in his palm"). Avoids clichés and formulaic prose, though "saturated ambivalence" feels slightly forced.</comment>
