<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "dutiful sentinel" trait feels slightly underdeveloped in action. Her transformation into an activist is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the climax (destroying the grid) could benefit from more foreshadowing. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the lab-turned-wedding-venue is vivid and thematically resonant. Sensory details (bioluminescent glow) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hair clip, obsolete panels) and a memorable ending. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Theme of revolution through science is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("photosynthetic poetry"). Minor AI-like phrasing in early descriptions ("delightfully strange"). Avoids clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's vision. Length feels deliberate. Lingering impact: challenges readers to rethink progress and tradition.</comment>
