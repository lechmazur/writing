<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cornelius' transformation from rigidity to emotional openness is compelling and well-executed, though his initial "certainly uncertain" trait could be more deeply integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s progression is tight and purposeful, with Tesla’s bulb and the witch’s revelation driving a satisfying arc. Minor pacing hiccups near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vividly rendered, enhancing both mood and theme. Sensory details (moss-slicked steps, whispering plants) are exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending science and mysticism, though "cradle empathy in arms of steel" verges on overwrought. Avoids AI clichés impressively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem that transcends its constraints. Only the adhesive analysis feels underdeveloped; otherwise, every element serves the whole.</comment>
