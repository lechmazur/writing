<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly wound around decoding and healing, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with sensory details (meteoric stone, starfruit) enhancing the atmosphere. The floating fortress and library’s closure heighten tension beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dream catchers, elixirs) and layered themes of grief/connection elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the “painful joy” motif could be subtler.</comment>
