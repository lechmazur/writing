<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is compellingly nuanced—his conscientious objection contrasts sharply with his covert intelligence gathering. Motivation is clear and actions align, though his "valiant boredom" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause/effect, but the climax feels subdued. Pacing is tight, though the resolution could linger more on the moral tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard and craft fairs create a vivid, ironic contrast between idyllic setting and sinister purpose. Sensory details (cider, rusty nail) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong subtext about deception and morality. Symbolism (nail, storm damage) is effective, but some dialogue feels overly expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("xenial deception"). Avoids clichés, though the "coy malevolence" tone occasionally strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering unease about complicity.</comment>
