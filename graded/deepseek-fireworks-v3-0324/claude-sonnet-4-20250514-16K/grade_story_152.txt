<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The juggler's motivation is clear and richly tied to the love letter, but her 'frenzied' state could be more deeply explored to reveal greater emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and momentum within the tight word limit, though the tea-leaves method feels slightly abrupt in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The void and abandoned summer create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere, but sensory details beyond sight/sound could deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept. Only critique: 'peculiarly functional void' risks slight jargon-y abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, leaving the reader with profound thematic resonance. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
