<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation to stand witness for the unremembered is clear and deeply intertwined with her formally rebellious nature and poetic voice. Her actions consistently align with her established traits, though a tad more nuanced internal conflict could elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cryptic shapes and sundial driving the narrative coherently. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from riddle-solving to station arrival could be slightly smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ivy-choked railway station is vividly rendered, with sensory details (whispering tendrils, shifting wax seal) enhancing the quietly intense atmosphere. Setting and object (sundial) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext—poetry as rebellion against institutional silence—with potent symbolism (sundial as podium). Literary devices are used masterfully, though the ending’s resolution verges on over-neatness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("ivy claims abandoned places"), but some phrases skirt predictability ("quiet fury"). Emotional resonance is strong, though a few beats could feel less calculated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the story thrives within its constraints. Leaves a lingering question about historical erasure, though the thematic weight slightly overshadows character depth.</comment>
