<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation that bleeds into his actions and voice. His "rarely honest" attribute and philosophical delusions create depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot’s circular structure—beginning and ending with the cup—works well, though the middle drifts slightly into abstraction. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard’s gothic atmosphere and sewer contrasts elevate the mundane horror. Sensory details (e.g., moonlight on the cracked cup) are razor-sharp.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (cup as cracked grail) and subtext (delusion as coping mechanism). The ending lingers with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Refreshingly original voice—no tropes or clichés. Nuanced emotions (e.g., grief as "rust and regret") feel authentically human, not AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered vignette. The brevity serves its meditative tone, and the elements interlock seamlessly to probe existential themes.</comment>
