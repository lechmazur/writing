<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maeve's no-nonsense empathy and role as a blacksmith are vividly realized, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. Her actions align well with her traits, though her freedom could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from conflict to resolution. The heartbeat method ties everything together, though the transition to mollifying the children feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is richly atmospheric, with evocative sensory details that enhance the melancholic yet hopeful mood. The setting and timeframe are seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (heartbeat, ornament) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some moments of "telling" dilute the impact. Theme of preserving traditions is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style is purposeful. Some descriptors are slightly generic, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively executed, with a lingering sense of warmth. The brevity feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story well. Minor room for deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
