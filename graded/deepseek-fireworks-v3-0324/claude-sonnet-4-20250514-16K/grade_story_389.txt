<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erasmus's hunger for forbidden knowledge is compelling, but his thin-lipped warlock persona feels slightly underdeveloped, relying more on archetype than depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot efficiently converges on the figurehead fragment, though the optimization logic feels abrupt. Pacing balances urgency and atmosphere well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mine-library hybrid is vividly atmospheric, with dust and decay amplifying Erasmus's isolation. Sensory details are immersive but occasionally over-written.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "knowledge is sustenance") elevate the prose. The ending’s ambiguity is purposeful, though the theme of obsession is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality falters near tropes (mad scholar, enchanted artifact), but the "formally casual" twist and mine setting offer freshness. Some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the mine and figurehead fragment justifying the brevity. Leaves a lingering unease about Erasmus’s fate.</comment>
