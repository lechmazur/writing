<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from sullen to inspired is compelling. His motivation is clear and deeply tied to the quilt's symbolism, though his "objectively biased" trait could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is tight and satisfying. The leap from quilt to rewiring feels organic, though the resolution arrives almost too swiftly for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly oppressive, and the quilt’s sensory details ground the atmosphere. A rare strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stamps = boundaries) and subtext. The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, though "borrowed valor" leans slightly cliché. The quilt’s construction feels uniquely human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s core theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
