<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear and deeply woven into her actions, revealing resilience and quiet defiance against despair. Her distinct 'voice' emerges through meticulous detail and reverence for the past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around her methodical planting, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The comet’s threat and the weathervane’s guidance create a cohesive arc, though the ending could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard and comet create a haunting atmosphere, enriched by vivid sensory details (amber glow, blackened bark). The setting amplifies the hermit’s isolation and purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (pressed flowers as genetic memory) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The theme of rebirth from ruin is layered but occasionally spelled out too plainly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrasing leans poetic to a fault. The hermit’s rebellion feels fresh, but the "deliberate wilderness" tone teeters on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story’s mood and message, though the word limit slightly truncates the emotional payoff.</comment>
