<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnus's motivation is clear and distinct, with his rational yet subjective approach to mapping the city's hidden gardens revealing his nuanced personality.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with Magnus's excavation of meaning through polaroids driving the narrative effectively. The resolution—realizing time is a boundary—ties back to the beginning elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with the floating sky-lounge and endless city creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., obsidian bar, polaroids like fallen stars) enrich the setting and tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using metaphors (e.g., "map of longing") and symbolism (broken watch band) to deepen themes. The ending is satisfying and thought-provoking, though dialogue could be sharper.</comment>
