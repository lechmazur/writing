<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's dual heritage and her father's legacy are clear motivators, but her "sweetly fierce" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated in actions beyond fan use.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the walkie-talkie device feels slightly contrived as a primary driver of conflict resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, but the walkie-talkie mechanic slightly undermines the otherwise lush atmosphere.</comment>
