<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus' underwater welding background and "patiently impatient" nature are well-integrated, but his deeper motivation to wield improbable power feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot’s temporal unraveling is coherent and compelling, though the club setting’s role as a "beacon" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—neon-club-meets-drowned-observatory is vividly immersive, with striking sensory details (e.g., "captured starlight").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich subtext (generational legacy, temporal repair) and layered symbolism (welding as time-mending). The ending lingers, though the grandmother’s approval feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the theme. The word limit feels like a strength, not a constraint.</comment>
