<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her grandfather's legacy, with her zealot-like dedication to chaos theory reflecting her emotional and intellectual depth. However, her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with chaos theory mirroring Elena's personal arc. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the connection between political upheaval and her work could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's juxtaposition of rustic and cutting-edge elements is brilliantly evocative. Sensory details (coffee stains, tobacco smell) enrich the atmosphere, grounding the abstract concepts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (banknotes as forgotten wishes) and subtext (sacrifice as creation). The ending is profound, and the writing style elevates the story's emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors are fresh (chaos theory as legacy), and the emotional resonance is subtle yet powerful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply layered story where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on sacrifice and legacy.</comment>
