<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly realized with clear motivation, blending indigenous wisdom and mechanical intuition seamlessly. His actions align perfectly with his role as guardian of knowledge and hearth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus’s emulation of ancestral patterns driving the narrative toward a resonant, earned resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (dice as algorithms), evocative subtext (preservation vs. progress), and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Every word serves the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of indigenous knowledge with quantum tech feels fresh, and the prose is precise without being florid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where every element elevates the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lasting impression of quiet revolution.</comment>
