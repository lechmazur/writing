<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with her feral existence and emotional baggage well-integrated into her actions. Her character arc feels organic, though the "feral ranger" label could be more grounded in specific details.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the receipts and dandelion field serving dual symbolic and functional roles. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the farmhouse resolution might benefit from slightly more setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dandelion field and brass scale are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Maya's emotional state, though the "precisely random" motif occasionally feels overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (scale, receipts, seeds) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Literary craft elevates the narrative beyond its brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Minor quibbles: "feral ranger" borders on clich√©, and the code-word method feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
