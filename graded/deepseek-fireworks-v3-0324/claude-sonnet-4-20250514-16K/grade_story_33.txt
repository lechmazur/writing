<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation and traits are vividly drawn, with her obsession with birds and leaves revealing a deep internal conflict about order vs. chaos. Her voice is distinct, and her actions align with her established motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The cosmic blink concept ties the beginning and end together effectively, but the pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile leaf classification office contrasts beautifully with the wildness of nature Eleanor observes. Sensory details (porcelain shards, marble reflections) enhance the atmosphere, making the setting deeply evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with rich symbolism (mask, reflections) and subtext about chaos and order. The ending is satisfying, and the theme resonates powerfully. Dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "braided bitterness") are fresh, and emotions are shown, not told. The narrative maintains a consistent, unique style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. It leaves a lingering thought about chaos and order, suggesting depth.</comment>
