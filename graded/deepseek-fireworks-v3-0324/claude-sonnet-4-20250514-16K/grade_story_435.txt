<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation is clear and compelling, driven by her professional insight and personal convictions.

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well within the word limit, with a logical progression from setup to climax. The connection between the beginning and end is clear, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility and its eerie, industrial atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story’s tension and supporting Elena’s rebellion. Sensory details (steam, ovens, crumpled paper) are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s use of metaphor (dreams as living connections) and symbolism (the Council’s stone laws) adds depth. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deepened.</comment>
