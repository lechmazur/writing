<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's linguistic ineptitude and dance-driven communication are brilliantly integrated into her character, revealing depth and internal conflict. Her motivation (fulfilling prophecy) is clear but could benefit from more explicit early hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tightly woven, with the prophecy twist landing powerfully. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the starship could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (lavender scent, cracked porcelain) immerse the reader. The chamber's shifting reality enhances the eerie atmosphere, though the "bubble bath" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of dance as symbolic language. The ending's ambivalence lingers, and the theme of silenced truth resonates. Minor quibble: the prophecy's phrasing could be more poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "memory bubbles rise like forgotten words") and subversion of sci-fi tropes (headcounts as protection) showcase originality. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh seamlessly, with the photo tradition and denial weight being particularly impactful. The word limit feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
