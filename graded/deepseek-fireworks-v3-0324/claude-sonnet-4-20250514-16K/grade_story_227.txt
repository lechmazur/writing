<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kess's motivation is clear and aligns with her rebellious nature, but her "underdog magician" trait feels slightly underdeveloped compared to her role as a decoder of symbols.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with sun-tracking and dream-decoding driving the narrative forward logically. The unresolved countdown adds haunting coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (dust, flickering display, sunbeams) enhancing the mood of quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (phoenix, chains, light), layered subtext, and a purposeful ending make this story linger. The prose is polished but never overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "subtle uprising" concept and Kess's method feel distinct, though "drainingly invigorated" verges on forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about inevitability. A standout piece.</comment>
