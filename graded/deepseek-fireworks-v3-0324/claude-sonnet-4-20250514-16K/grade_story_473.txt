<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maeve's motivation is clear and nuanced, with her eccentricity and resistance to conventional leadership adding depth. However, some of her actions feel slightly overdetermined by the plot's need to incorporate all elements.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but effective; the pruning lesson as a metaphor works well, though the hidden disclaimers subplot feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a vivid, original atmosphere, with sensory details enhancing mood. The setting feels vital rather than decorative.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pruning as mapping, shadows as fate) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the "bittersweet grit" tone occasionally overtakes subtlety.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., branches as neural pathways). Avoids cliché, though the manual’s spidery handwriting feels slightly contrived.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the "secret disclaimers" device strains plausibility. The brevity feels deliberate, with lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
