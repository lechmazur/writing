<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lord Pemberton's submissive yet perceptive nature is vividly portrayed, driving his actions with clear, consistent motivation. His distinct voice and empathetic rebellion shine.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the eavesdropping and liquefaction method logically advancing the story. Pacing and coherence are excellent within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop contrasts brilliantly with Pemberton's mundane tasks, enhancing the absurdity. Sensory details (e.g., echo chambers, heating element) deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés with fresh metaphors ("whispers in a cathedral") and nuanced emotion. The eccentric premise is executed with authentic style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering charm—absurd rebellion with heart.</comment>
