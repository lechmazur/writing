<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the future bulletins driving a clear arc of redemption. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. Leaves the reader with lingering warmth and hope.</comment>
