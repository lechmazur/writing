<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his unique ability to see ghosts, lending authenticity to his actions. His "elegantly clumsy" trait subtly enhances his character without overshadowing his depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from Marcus's curiosity to his encounter with Eleanor, achieving a satisfying arc. Pacing is tight yet deliberate, avoiding rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an evocative, underused setting that amplifies the ghostly atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "whispers threading through the dissonance of silence") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (e.g., repairing vs. listening) and layered symbolism (flower crown, silence) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("debugging faulty elevator code") avoid clich√©. Nuanced handling of grief and memory feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's cohesion. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting yet polished impression.</comment>
