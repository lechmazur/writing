<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight, with a clear arc; the twist recontextualizes the plot cohesively. Drum solos could be more organically woven into causality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the baton’s reimagined power and Viktor’s transformation feel inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
