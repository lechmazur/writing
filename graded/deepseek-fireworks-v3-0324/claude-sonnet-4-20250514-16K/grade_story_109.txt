<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gareth's transformation from cold knight to artist is subtly and convincingly portrayed, with the mitten serving as a perfect catalyst. His motivations remain consistent yet evolve organically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the mitten's discovery driving both action and emotional arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive—lonely streets and fluorescent-lit secrecy contrast beautifully with the warmth of folk traditions. Sensory details (sodden mitten, breath in cold air) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the mitten's symbolism, Gareth's sketches as "witness," and the theme of softness versus armor are layered and resonant. Only a hair shy of flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The knight's artistic awakening feels fresh, though the "lawfully rebellious" trait could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect vignette. Every element serves the story's emotional core, leaving a lingering question about vulnerability's strength.</comment>
