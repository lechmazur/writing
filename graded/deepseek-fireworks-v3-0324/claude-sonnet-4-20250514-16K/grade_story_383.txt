<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>General Thorne's exhaustion and existential crisis are vividly portrayed, with his military past and current vulnerability creating a compelling contrast. His "voice" is distinct, and his motivation (to overcome fear) is clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the carousel and photographs serving as effective metaphors for transformation. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner and cosmic twilight create a rich, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (seaweed’s taste, shifting waitress) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (arcs, carousel) and layered themes (fear vs. renewal). The ending is poignant and resonant, with dialogue that crackles with wit and wisdom.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Metaphors are fresh (e.g., "hope wearing a general’s uniform"), and emotional nuance is shown, not told. No AI-generated stiffness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story excels at cohesion, with elements serving the narrative organically. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of possibility and reflection.</comment>
