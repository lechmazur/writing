<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldrich's centuries of quiet longing and transformation from seasickness to determination are compelling and consistent, though his 'awkward charm' could be more distinctly showcased in dialogue or action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with lunar tracking and the ghost orchid bulb driving the narrative toward a satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count.</comment>
