<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's brazen raider persona and Elena's brittle genius are sharply defined, with clear motivations. Kira's impulsively thoughtful nature and use of superstition add depth, though Elena's exhaustion could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear escalation from warning to escape. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the discovery of Marcus's betrayal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drowned city lab is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (dripping water, bioluminescent hunters) enhancing tension. Social upheaval overhead is implied effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (charcoal wards, "shelter your flame") and subtext about trust. Ending is purposeful, though the emotional weight of betrayal could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("genius flickering like a candle in hurricane winds"). Avoids clich√©s, and the fusion of tech and superstition feels innovative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, with the underwater lab and charcoal wards serving the theme of preserving light against darkness. Feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
