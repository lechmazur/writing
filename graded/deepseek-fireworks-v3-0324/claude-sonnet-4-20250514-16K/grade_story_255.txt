<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving her actions consistently. Her 'nondescript' appearance contrasts effectively with her sharp intellect and supernatural ability, creating a layered character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The encryption challenge and its resolution via rain-scented insight are original and cohesive within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a vivid, atmospheric setting. Sensory details (petrichor, stale confetti) enhance the mood and tie into Maya's abilities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative prose with strong literary devices (e.g., rain as a metaphor for revelation). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of justice resonates beyond the plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of espionage and supernatural elements. Maya's "innocent cynicism" voice feels fresh, and the emotional stakes avoid clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact with its thematic weight and character depth.</comment>
