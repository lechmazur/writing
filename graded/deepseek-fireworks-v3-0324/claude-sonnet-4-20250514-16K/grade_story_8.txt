<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Caspian's motivation is clear and compelling, his rebellion against tradition is vividly portrayed, and his actions align with his empirically rebellious nature. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could deepen his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from questioning to defiance. The method (chalk revisions) drives the plot logically, and pacing is excellent for the word limit. A tad more tension could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sound garden is masterfully evoked, enhancing mood and action. Sensory details (metallic whispers, wooden groans) immerse the reader. The setting and object (chalk) are deeply connected, supporting the theme of dissonance and harmony.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and literary devices (e.g., symbolism of erasure). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of truth vs. tradition is explored memorably. A touch more emotional resonance in key moments would make it flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh, and the prose is purposeful without being overly ornate. Nuanced handling of emotion and rebellion elevates it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Creative thinking is evident, and it lingers in the mind. Near-perfect execution.</comment>
