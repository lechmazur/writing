<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, with her rebellious shift from collaboration to defiance well-executed. However, her "ambitious herbalist" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the storm and escape aligning logically. Pacing is excellent, though the bunker's security oversight strains credibility.</comment>
