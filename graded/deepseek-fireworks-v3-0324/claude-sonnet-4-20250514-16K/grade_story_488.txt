<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation and solitude are vividly portrayed, but her "outshine reflection" drive could be more deeply explored for emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly structured, with demolition-as-creation serving as a brilliant unifying thread. Pacing is exceptional for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Quantum beach and lighthouse corrosion create a mesmerizing, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rusted bones, flickering footprints) are razor-sharp.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (leaf, reflections) and thematic depth. Ending resonates with haunting clarity. Literary craft is flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in blending demolition with summoning. Minor nit: "corroded rapture" repeats. Otherwise, no AI tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm of speculative fiction. Only lacks a fraction more emotional vulnerability to hit absolute pinnacle.</comment>
