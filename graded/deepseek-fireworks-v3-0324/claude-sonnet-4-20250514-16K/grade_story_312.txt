<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' agoraphobia and inherited burden are vividly portrayed, driving his actions with clear, poignant motivation. His voice is distinct, though his epiphany could use slightly more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with rain and snuffbox logically driving the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the curse's mechanics could be subtly foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and rain create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "ancient rhythm," "sweet air") elevate the desert city's mystique. A standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (snuffbox as generational cage) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying, though the spirits' dialogue verges on exposition. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "magic masquerading as mental illness"). Minor stiffness in the spirits' dialogue, but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's theme of liberation. Lingering impact from the rain's cleansing symbolism. A rare gem in flash fiction.</comment>
