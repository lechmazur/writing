<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is compelling and consistent, her whimsical yet grim occupation revealing depth. However, some nuances of her emotional state could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven and coherent, with environmental decay and mortality as clear drivers. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional—cavern, palace, and carnival blend seamlessly into a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (mercury, creaking stalactites) elevate the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Story delivers profound emotional and thematic impact, with strong symbolism (thermometer as doom-clock) and a memorable, layered ending. Minor nit: some metaphors verge on overripe.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept, avoiding clichés. The "practical illusion" tone is fresh, though a few descriptors ("grinding gears") lean slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce brilliantly into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the theme resonates beyond the page.</comment>
