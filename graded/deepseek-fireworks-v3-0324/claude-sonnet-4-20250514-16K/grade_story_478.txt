<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Meredith's character is vividly portrayed with clear, compelling motivation. Her role as a secretive midwife and her quest to reclaim stolen memories are well-integrated, though her critical nature could be slightly more emphasized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from discovery to ritual. The pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect logic holds. Minor quibble: the transition to acceptance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom are masterfully evoked, blending atmosphere with thematic resonance. Sensory details (lavender, creaking trees) deepen immersion. A near-perfect balance of eerie and serene.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (herbs, moon) and layered subtext elevate this. The ending is satisfying yet open. Some phrasing could be sharper, but the emotional and thematic impact is undeniable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The memory-stealing premise is inventive, though a few descriptors ("dissonant calm") verge on overused. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story elegantly. Lingers in the mind due to its thematic depth. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
