<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation and background are vividly sketched, with clear alignment between her past, her defiance, and her current actions. The "typically atypical" attribute provides a distinct edge to her character, though her "voice" could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Elena's actions driving a clear arc from survival to hope. The word limit is well-managed, though the transition from decoding to planting could be marginally smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war twilight are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (glowing seeds, mist) amplifying the haunting atmosphere. The setting feels inseparable from the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cards as genetics, bottles as lifelines) and layered themes (freedom vs. control) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, though the "song of boundaries" could be slightly more tangible in its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original blend of post-apocalyptic sci-fi and lyrical mysticism. Some phrases ("jabber-coded") verge on overworked, but the overall voice avoids clich√© and feels distinctly human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that balances assigned elements with organic storytelling. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant aftertaste of defiance and renewal.</comment>
