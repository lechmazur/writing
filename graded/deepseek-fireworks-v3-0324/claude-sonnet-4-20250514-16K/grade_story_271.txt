<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe’s morbid artistry and the boy’s fascination are vividly portrayed, but his "consistently strange" trait could be more deeply explored to align with his defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively, with the juggling act and shared smile creating a clear arc. Pacing is tight yet natural, though the lab’s role could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory’s decay and spice-laden atmosphere are masterfully evoked, though the "abandoned" aspect slightly overshadows the experiments’ relevance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Defiant compassion resonates powerfully, with layered symbolism (ruler, fingers) and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Minor tightening of thematic threads would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, avoiding clichés. The grotesque juggling and rare spices feel fresh, though Marlowe’s dialogue risks leaning toward performative wisdom.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the lab and spices slightly underutilized. The story’s brevity enhances its impact.</comment>
