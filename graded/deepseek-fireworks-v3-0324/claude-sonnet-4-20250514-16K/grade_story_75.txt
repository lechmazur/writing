<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kira's guarded nature and minstrel identity shape her actions and skepticism well. Her motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear, but her transition from skepticism to resolve could be nuanced further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by decryption, but the nano-forest setting feels slightly disconnected from the core conflict. Pacing is effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest's bioluminescent atmosphere is vivid and enhances Kira's emotional state, though its connection to the Rootweavers' mission could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, lute) and subtext (betrayal vs. preservation). Ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original handling of grassroots preservation and betrayal. Avoids clich√©s, though the nano-forest concept slightly overshadows the crafts theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, but the nano-forest feels more decorative than integral. Leaves a lingering reflection on preservation vs. exploitation.</comment>
