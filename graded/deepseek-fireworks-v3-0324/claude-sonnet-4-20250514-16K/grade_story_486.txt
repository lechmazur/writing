<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is compelling and her 'clumsily dexterous' attribute gives her a distinct, memorable personality. The connection between her brother’s unjust conviction and her obsession with silencing the jurors is strong, though her transformation into a reality-bending avenger could use more grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight and progresses logically, but the abrupt shift from street pantomime to supernatural retribution feels slightly rushed. The ending is satisfying, though the mechanics of her revenge could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch’s cauldron room as a setting is evocative, and the stained glass fragment is brilliantly integrated. Sensory details (bubbling cauldrons, pulsing light) enhance the eerie atmosphere, though more could be done with sound beyond silence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is rich with symbolism (stained glass, chalkboard hush) and subtext (justice as enforced truth). The prose is striking but occasionally overwrought, and the emotional impact is strong but could delve deeper into Mira’s psyche.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The fusion of technology and witchcraft feels fresh, though some phrases (“clumsily dexterous”) risk leaning into quirkiness for its own sake.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and the elements serve the narrative well. The brevity works in its favor, but the high-concept premise might benefit from a slightly longer exploration.</comment>
