<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and compelling, her actions align with her growth from spectacle to subtlety, and her transformation is well-articulated. However, her "wide-eyed" trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the method of resistance is inventive. Pacing is excellent, though the underwater setting could be more integral to the conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocatively described, but its underwater nature feels incidental. Sensory details are strong but could better reinforce the city's oppressive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hammer, runes) and subtext. The ending resonates, and the theme of quiet rebellion is powerfully conveyed. Minimal dialogue is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The "methodically chaotic" approach and silent rebellion feel fresh. Prose is precise, though a few phrases border on overly lyrical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering theme of subtle resistance is memorable.</comment>
