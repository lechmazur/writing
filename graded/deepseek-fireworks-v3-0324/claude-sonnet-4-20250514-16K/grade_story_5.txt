<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's guarded nature and apothecary role are deeply integrated into her actions and motivations, creating a distinct, compelling character. Her "theoretically whimsical" approach adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the amulet's nightmares driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending hints at cyclical continuity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The power plant setting is vividly atmospheric, amplifying the story's eerie yet scholarly tone. Sensory details (creaking chair, amber lighting) immerse the reader seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (seashell, amulet) and subtext (wisdom through terror). The theme of reclaiming lost knowledge resonates deeply. Prose is lyrical but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original blend of gothic horror and scholarly pursuit. No clich√©s; metaphors ("liquid starlight") are fresh. Emotion is conveyed through action and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce organically. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for thematic depth. Lingers in the mind long after reading.</comment>
