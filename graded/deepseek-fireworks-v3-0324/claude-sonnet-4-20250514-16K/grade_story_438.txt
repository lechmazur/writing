<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and compelling, but her 'vague mystic' portrayal feels slightly underdeveloped for such a high-concept narrative. Her discreet flamboyance is intriguing but could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong cause-and-effect chain. The override action drives the tension effectively, though the polaroid method's abrupt resolution slightly weakens the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab and post-stellar setting are vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the mood. The compass and polaroids are meaningfully connected to the world, though the timeframe's impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (compass, dust) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly purposeful, and the style elevates the story's emotional and intellectual weight. Only minor refinement needed in thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "hollow recklessness" tone occasionally feels overstated. The voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story with deliberate brevity. The elements serve the narrative well, leaving a lingering question about ethical boundaries. Minor tightening would perfect it.</comment>
