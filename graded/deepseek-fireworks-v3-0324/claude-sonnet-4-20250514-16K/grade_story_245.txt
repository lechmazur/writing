<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's grief and motivation are vividly rendered, though his "irate smuggler" archetype leans slightly generic. The chopstick as anchor is an original touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing is taut; transitions between memory and action are smooth. The ending resolution feels earned but slightly rushed due to word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport atmosphere is visceral and thematically resonant. Sensory details (acrid air, durasteel, thermos) are sharply evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (tea leaves, chopstick) is potent, though the "heart's revolt" phrasing borders on melodrama. Emotional impact is strong but not wholly groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in details (chopstick as relic, tea-leaf divination), but the Syndicate-as-villain trope lacks subversion. Prose avoids purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingering melancholic resonance elevates it beyond its length.</comment>
