<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation and personality are sharply defined, though her 'patient librarian' trait feels underdeveloped compared to her vengeful precision.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight, with the mixtapes and revenge arc resolving cohesively, though the steampunk setting slightly distracts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly described but occasionally overshadows the emotional core; sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors ("hyperactively serene"), avoiding clich√©s. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a resonant whole, though the steampunk backdrop feels slightly imposed. Lingers unsettlingly.</comment>
