<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelan's morose demeanor and his centuries-long vigil are compelling, though Elena's motivation could be deeper. His connection to the needle is vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blackout and flare creating urgency. The needle's role as a key device is logical and well-paced, though Elena's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory's "lavishly austere" setting and the cosmic timeframe are brilliantly evoked. Sensory details (humming engines, pulse of walls) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext (humanity's cosmic exhaustion, hidden knowledge). The needle's symbolism and the ending's quiet triumph are masterful. Dialogue is sparse but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original—neutron-star needle and post-naming cosmos feel fresh. No clichés; prose avoids excess ornamentation while remaining vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s cohesion. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting question: what secrets remain beyond naming?</comment>
