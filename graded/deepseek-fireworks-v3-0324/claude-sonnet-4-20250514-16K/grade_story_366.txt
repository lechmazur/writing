<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's telepathy and obsession with decoding weather journals are well-integrated into her character, though her "efficiently inefficient" trait could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to validation, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the foreman's conversion to belief.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harbor setting and seasonal transition are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and Maya's isolation in her quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh perspective on weather prediction, with no clich√©s or AI-generated tells. Minor nit: "noble foolishness" slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, leaving a lingering question about unseen patterns in the world. Word count feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
