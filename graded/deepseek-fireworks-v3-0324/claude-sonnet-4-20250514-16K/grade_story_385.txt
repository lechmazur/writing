<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn's meddling nature and manipulative tendencies are well-established and drive her actions consistently. Her guilt is a nuanced touch, but her motivation could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The decoding mystery unfolds organically, though the resolution's moral ambiguity could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The skyscraper and shoreline contrast is evocative, but the obsidian setting feels underutilized. The fluorescent light and shifting symbols enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skates, seeds, tides) and subtext (ethical manipulation). The ending lingers with purposeful ambiguity, though some metaphors verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "lucid confusion" tone occasionally clashes with the clinical setting. The Norse rune twist feels fresh, avoiding clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story well, though the skyscraper's relevance could be stronger.</comment>
