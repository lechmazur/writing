<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's submarine engineering background and superstition are well-integrated, but his unease feels slightly underdeveloped given the story's stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with Elena’s notebook serving as a natural pivot from scavenger hunt to metaphysical journey—though the hunt’s setup feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful: the caverns' eerie pulsing and the thunder-lightning liminality enhance the supernatural dread.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich subtext (engineering vs. poetry, science vs. mysticism) and vivid imagery elevate this beyond genre tropes. The ending lingers, though Elena’s connection to Marcus could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "between sound and flash") avoid cliché, but the scavenger hunt frame risks generic adventure tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements—only the scavenger hunt feels slightly tacked-on versus the notebook’s organic centrality.</comment>
