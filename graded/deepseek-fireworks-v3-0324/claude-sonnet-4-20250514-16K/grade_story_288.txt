<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivations and backstory are deeply intertwined with his craft and personal loss, creating a poignant, distinct character. Sarah's suppressed research adds layers but feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sculpture's creation serving as a powerful climax. Pacing is strong, though the paddleboarding bond could be more organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The toxic lake and monitoring station are vividly rendered, amplifying the story's tension and themes. Sensory details (brittle flag, poisoned air) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flag-as-DNA, sculpture as monument), layered themes (loss, defiance), and a hauntingly resonant ending elevate this beyond typical dystopian fare.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("audacious meekness"). Minor stumbles: "professionally wild" feels contrived, and paddleboardingâ€™s role is slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, aching meditation on environmental collapse and legacy. The constraints of brevity are turned into a strength, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
