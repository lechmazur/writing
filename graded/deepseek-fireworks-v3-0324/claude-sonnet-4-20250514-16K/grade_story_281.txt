<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from theft to redemption is tightly woven, with the dummy’s role as catalyst feeling organic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse engine room is hauntingly atmospheric, with the dummy’s presence amplifying decay and mystery. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>
