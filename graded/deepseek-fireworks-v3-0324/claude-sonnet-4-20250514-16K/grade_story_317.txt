<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit-47's nostalgic yet determined personality is well-defined, with clear motivation rooted in past betrayals. However, Dr. Chen's actions lack deeper justification beyond being "suspiciously furtive."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain leading to Unit-47's intervention. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline towers and cave system create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "soft fizz," "ethereal light") enhance the tension and mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (telescope as foresight, crystals as fragility) and subtext (cycles of human fallibility). The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("brazen modesty," "whispered warnings"). Avoids clich√©s, though Unit-47's dialogue occasionally leans robotic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
