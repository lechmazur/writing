<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's shaky hands and carefully reckless nature are vividly portrayed, driving his desperate search with emotional depth. His motivation—to find forgiveness—is clear and compelling, though his mercenary background could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marcus's search for Elena's painting creating a clear arc. The resolution—his decision to call her—feels earned, though the rumor chains could be more fleshed out for coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is richly atmospheric, blending decay and artistry. Sensory details (paint fumes, shattered glass) deepen immersion, and the amber spider’s symbolism ties elegantly to the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craftsmanship: symbolism (amber as guilt/patience), layered subtext, and a resonant ending. The writing style is polished, with "show, don’t tell" mastery. Only minor polish needed for absolute perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The amber spider metaphor is fresh, and emotions are nuanced. No AI hallmarks—authentic voice and inventive use of tropes (e.g., mercenary with trembling hands).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and deeply thematic, with room only for slight refinement.</comment>
