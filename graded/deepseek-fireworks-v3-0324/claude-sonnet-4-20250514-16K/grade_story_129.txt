<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in generational trauma, and her actions align with her goal of breaking the curse. However, her "somber troubadour" aspect feels underdeveloped in such a short piece.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from curse to resolution. The tablecloth method is inventive but risks feeling overly symbolic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned launch site is evocatively rendered, enhancing both atmosphere and theme, though the "profound transformation" timeframe is more implied than deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and lyrical prose to convey emotion and theme. The ending is satisfying, though the "hushed euphoria" tone occasionally clashes with the story's weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrases ("steadily unpredictable") verge on contrived, but the core concept avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, though a few concepts could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>
