<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's character is vividly developed, with clear motivation and a distinct arc. His internal conflict ("the father who wanted to save her and the realist who knew she had the right to fail") is compelling and drives his actions. However, his "shifty caretaker" trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from desperation to acceptance. The surreal circus caravans and mineralized tears serve as effective symbolic devices, though the connection between the parole hearing and the circus could be slightly more explicit.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in theater and pre-dawn setting create a haunting, liminal atmosphere. Sensory details ("cracked movie screen," "static-filled silence") enrich the mood. The circus caravans, though surreal, fit the tone perfectly.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb storytelling craft—evocative metaphors (tears as "tiny monuments"), emotional depth, and a resonant theme of letting go. The ending is purposeful and lingers. Only minor tightening of transitions could elevate it further.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The mineralized tears and circus caravans are fresh, and Marcus's emotional journey feels nuanced. A few phrases border on overwrought ("anguished joy wrestled within his chest").</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion and depth for its length. Every element serves the story, and the style enhances clarity. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lasting impression of bittersweet acceptance.</comment>
