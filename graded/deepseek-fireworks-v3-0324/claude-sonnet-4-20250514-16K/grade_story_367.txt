<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's character is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a compelling arc from herbalist to obsessive tide-watcher. Her "thoughtfully thoughtless" nature is subtly revealed through her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven around Elena's ritual, with logical cause-and-effect relationships. The constraint of the word limit is well-managed, though the ending leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and tactile, with evocative sensory details. The glass-walled observatory and ocean backdrop amplify Elena's isolation and obsession.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., the goose as symbol). The story lingers in the mind, balancing subtext and emotional resonance. Only minor refinement needed for absolute perfection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose, though a few phrases verge on overly lyrical ("mathematical poetry").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a haunting, unresolved question about obsession.</comment>
