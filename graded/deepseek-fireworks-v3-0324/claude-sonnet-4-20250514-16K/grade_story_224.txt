<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict and yearning are vividly portrayed, but his "openly private" nature could be more explicitly shown through dialogue or action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable; the ladle's magic resolves the conflict too neatly without deeper exploration of consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dining room's chaos and the ladle's pulsing energy create a rich atmosphere, though the giant's size could be leveraged more evocatively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (meteorite fragment, ladle) and emotional resonance, but the ending's affirmation feels overstated rather than subtly earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (weary musician, magical object). Some phrases ("gentle turmoil") verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels intentional, but the theme of escape lacks deeper interrogation.</comment>
