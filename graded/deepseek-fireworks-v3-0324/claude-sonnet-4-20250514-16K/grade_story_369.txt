<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus's fanatical dedication to puzzles and his optimistically bitter nature are well-integrated, driving his actions and reactions. His motivation to track spiritual development is clear but could delve deeper into his backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle's mechanics driving the narrative forward logically. The word limit is used effectively, though the ending's machinery reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and stormy atmosphere enhance the story's mood brilliantly. Sensory details (sea spray, driftwood) are evocative and deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (the maze as spiritual journey) is strong, and the writing style is polished. However, the emotional resonance could be sharper—Magnus's realization lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, with fresh metaphors (ships like "insects trapped in amber"). Avoids clichés, though the lethargic excitement tone occasionally feels overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with creative integration of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth, but the ending could linger more.</comment>
