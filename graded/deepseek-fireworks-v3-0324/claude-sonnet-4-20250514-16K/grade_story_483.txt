<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus' world-weary sheriff persona is well-developed, with clear motivation rooted in his father's memory and longing for freedom. His shift from duty to self-discovery feels organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, though the transition to the lava lamp scene feels slightly abrupt. The arc of breaking free is resolved subtly but effectively.</comment>
