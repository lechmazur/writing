<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict is palpable, and his motivation is clear, though his "rationally subjective" attribute could be more deeply explored. His actions align with his guilt and desire for redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the museum meetings feel slightly contrived. Pacing is effective, but the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The museum and static garden are vividly rendered, enhancing mood and symbolism. Sensory details (wooden slat, amber) deepen immersion and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and effective symbolism (slat as bridge). The ending is purposeful, though Sarah’s reaction could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows originality, but Marcus's "rationally subjective" voice feels underdeveloped. Emotion is conveyed well, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements weave together cohesively, supporting theme and character. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
