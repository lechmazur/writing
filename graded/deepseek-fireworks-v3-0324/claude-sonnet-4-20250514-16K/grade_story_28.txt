<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and richly tied to her family legacy, but her "sly agent" trait feels underdeveloped compared to her cultural preservationist role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the fork and dance serving as both MacGuffin and resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "sly agent" clashes subtly with the otherwise organic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Length feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
