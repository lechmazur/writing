<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara's ambivalent prophet role is compelling, but her "happily sad" attribute could be more deeply explored. Her motivation to scramble the cosmic scoreboard is clear, though her bashful arrogance occasionally feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, but the "final oath" concept could be more integrated. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (cracked marbles, artificial moonlight) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (marbles as timelines) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of "defragmentation" is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and purple prose. The narrative maintains a distinctive style without feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
