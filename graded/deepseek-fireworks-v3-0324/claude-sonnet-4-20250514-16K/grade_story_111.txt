<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply woven into her actions. Her transformation from doubt to exultant grief is compelling, though her "theoretically intuitive" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with brewing as a clear through-line. The pond ripple method feels slightly contrived, but the arc from failure to revelation is cohesive and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The underground dog park is richly atmospheric, blending secrecy and mundanity. Sensory details (liquid starlight, echoing footsteps) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon as unwritten stories) and emotional depth. The ending resonates with thematic weight, though the mentor's dialogue leans toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "liquid starlight") and nuanced handling of faith vs. doubt. No clich√©s, though the alchemist trope risks familiarity without Mira's unique exile context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. Only the pond rings slightly disrupt momentum.</comment>
