<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evangeline's motivation is clear, her actions are consistent with her reckless abandonment of her past, and her 'voice' is distinct through her introspective whispers and hollow laughter.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, with a strong cause-and-effect relationship between the burning estate, the ticket stubs, and Evangeline's defiance. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab setting is vividly rendered, complementing the destructive theme, though the timeframe (between texts) slightly weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the drone, the ticket stubs), layered subtext, and a powerful ending. Style enhances the thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is precise yet evocative, though a few descriptors ("hollow recklessness") border on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact of liberation through destruction.</comment>
