<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's dual identity as a street performer and disgraced knight is vividly rendered, with her internal conflict and motivation for redemption clearly driving her actions. The gauntlet's symbolism as penance is particularly potent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot deftly balances past and present, with the coral-pipe memory triggering a pivotal shift. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the steampunk lounge’s relevance to the climax could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Steam and brass visuals are immersive, but the coral-texture metaphor feels slightly overextended. The lounge’s atmosphere effectively mirrors Mira’s isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—redemption through art, trust as performance. The ending’s thematic resonance is powerful, though the puppet-show device risks leaning into trope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "coral reef of consciousness"). Minimal cliché, though the steampunk setting borders on familiar. Emotional nuance in Roderick’s disappointment elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette. The constrained length amplifies its focus on Mira’s epiphany. Leaves a lingering question: Can performance truly bridge betrayal?</comment>
