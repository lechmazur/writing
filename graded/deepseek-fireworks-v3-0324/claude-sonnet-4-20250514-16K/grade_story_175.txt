<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corvain's motivation is clear and his actions align well with his established traits. His "feral elegance" and hunger for truth create a compelling contrast with his role as a minstrel.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, leveraging the impending Centennial Harvest as a ticking clock. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mushroom village setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The bioluminescent glow and decaying sign deepen the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (birdcage, chipped paint) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, leaving the reader with a lingering question about truth vs. illusion.</comment>
