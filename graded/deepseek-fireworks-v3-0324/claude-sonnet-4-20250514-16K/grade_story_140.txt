<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's tortured protector persona is vividly drawn and his motivation to confront his past is clear. His transformation feels earned, though Elena’s character could benefit from more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from denial to acceptance. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the planetarium show’s logistical setup feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is immersive and haunting. Sensory details (broken mirror, moth-eaten costumes) enhance atmosphere, but the timeframe’s phrasing (“dawn’s second breath”) is overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (doll, stars) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though Elena’s dialogue occasionally tips into melodrama (“my guardian”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The doll’s role is fresh, but the “suspiciously sweet” trait leans slightly trope-y. Nuanced handling of Marcus’s fear and acceptance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
