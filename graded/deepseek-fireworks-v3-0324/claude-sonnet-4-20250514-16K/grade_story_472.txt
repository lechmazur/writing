<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is vividly clear, and her "sharp gentleness" is consistently woven into her actions. Her transition from matchmaker to interstellar decoder feels organic and revealing of her depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the button and flag method driving the narrative elegantly. The resolution—tying silence to interstellar communication—is both surprising and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The floating library and zeppelin setting is gorgeously immersive, with sensory details (warm button, rippling flag) enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (button, flag) and subtext (communication through absence). The ending is profound, lingering on the theme of unspoken connection without being didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The concept of interstellar silence as communication is fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision, avoiding purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story resonates beyond its length, leaving the reader with a haunting meditation on silence.</comment>
