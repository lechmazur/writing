<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus' motivation is clear and consistent, with his overlooked existence driving his actions. His 'genuinely strange' obsession with receipts adds depth, though his sudden shift to detective feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with receipts and scalpel logically driving the revelation. Pacing is excellent, balancing tension and resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and fireworks timeframe create a vivid, crackling atmosphere. Sensory details (fluorescent lights, pulsing crystals) enhance mood and stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (crystals as patience, fireworks as climax). Subtext about marginalized voices elevates the narrative. Ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("truth waited with geological patience"). Avoids clich√©s, though Marcus' epiphany borders on overly neat.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements weave together seamlessly. The short length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about unseen witnesses to injustice.</comment>
