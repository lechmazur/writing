<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's sly nature and entertainer background are well-integrated into her motivation and defiance of prophecy. Her impulsiveness feels consistent but could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect from prophecy to rebellion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the diary exposition leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mushroom village and cabin are vividly rendered, with sensory details (creaking door, glowing runes) enhancing the eerie, whimsical atmosphere. Barn door motif is overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ticket stubs as chains) and subtext (prophecy as control). Ending is resonant and thematically potent, though "serene upheaval" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original twist on prophecy tropes with fresh metaphors (mushroom network). Minimal cliché, but "exhaled a breath" is trite. Character voice feels distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly—story feels deliberately compact, not constrained. Mushroom village elevates the rebellion theme beyond generic fantasy.</comment>
