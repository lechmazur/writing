<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from observation to action. Pacing is excellent, and the word limit feels like a strength.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is richly immersive, and the contrast with Marcus’s organic craft heightens the atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, neon) are masterfully used.</comment>
