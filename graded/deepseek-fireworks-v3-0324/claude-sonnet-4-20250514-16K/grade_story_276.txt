<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with her past guilt driving her meticulous work. Her reactions to the postcards and coathanger reveal depth, though her 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lurch of the fridge door acting as a pivotal moment. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The orbital setting and postcards create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (rustling, sunlight) immerse the reader and enhance the mood of isolation and revelation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (coathanger, debris) and subtext (redemption through observation). The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story lingers in the mind. The brevity feels deliberate, supporting the thematic weight of small, meaningful details.</comment>
