<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jax's outlaw-poet duality is compelling, but his shift from fleeing to deciphering feels slightly abrupt. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but compressed; the climax’s causality (dice + lens) could be clearer. Pacing balances urgency and mystery well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory is vividly rendered, with stellar sensory details (hissing steam, prismatic light). Atmosphere amplifies the story’s ambivalence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (dice, lens) and subtext (fate as performance). Ending is haunting but slightly opaque. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("clocks were liars") and nuanced emotion. Avoids tropes, though "intertwined destinies" leans familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; length feels intentional. Lingers on themes of choice and performance, though some logic gaps remain.</comment>
