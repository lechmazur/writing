<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "luck" driving her actions. Her voice is distinct, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with duplication and corruption driving the arc. Pacing is excellent, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The schoolhouse setting and eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (mildew, glowing violets) enhancing the mood. The "hush of the unremembered future" is less integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (violets as power, roots as corruption) and a haunting ending elevate this. The central conflict—gambling with decay—is compelling and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The spin-the-bottle mechanic is inventive, though the "cheerful despair" tone wobbles occasionally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering unease about power’s cost, though the timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
