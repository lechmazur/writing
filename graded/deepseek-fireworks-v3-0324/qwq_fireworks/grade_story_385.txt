<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and her manipulative nature is well-integrated, but her pleasant demeanor feels slightly underdeveloped given her covert actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Clara's decoding, but the footprints' introduction feels abrupt, and the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital create a vivid, eerie atmosphere, though the beach wanderer element clashes slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's lingering question about the footprints feels unresolved rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "scattered seeds" metaphor occasionally feels forced. Avoids clich√©s but could refine emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but some elements (footprints, seeds) don't fully mesh. The length feels deliberate, though the ending lacks punch.</comment>
