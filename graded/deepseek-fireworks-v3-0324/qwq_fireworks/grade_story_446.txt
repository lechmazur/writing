<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lorian's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "amiable gambler" trait feels underdeveloped compared to his obsession and mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect, though the firefly ritual's mechanics could be slightly more grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
