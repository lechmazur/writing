<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's phobia and stunt work create a compelling duality, but her motivation to confront the dark feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the net's unraveling, but the pyramid's sudden light feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cold fibers, whispers) enhancing the eerie mood. The net and envelope tie well to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (net as psyche) and subtext (fear/triumph) are effective, though the ending's resolution leans slightly toward telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (net knots as fears). Avoids clich√©s, but the "primal fear" phrasing feels generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the envelope and net serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
