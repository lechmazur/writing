<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's role is compelling, but some agents' tics feel underdeveloped. Her motivation is clear, though the hive's resistance could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a clear arc. The wax-drip method is inventive, but the transition from resistance to resolve feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting. The candlelit sublevel and coded wax elevate tension, though the facility's details could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional depth. The ending lingers, though the "sound of hindsight" motif risks overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "merry bitterness" tone wobbles. The charger plug's symbolism is fresh, yet its physical presence feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. The word limit serves the story's intensity, though some elements (e.g., the facility) could be more integrated.</comment>
