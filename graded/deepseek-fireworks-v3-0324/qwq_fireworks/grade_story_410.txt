<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hermit's astute yet practical nature is well-developed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His actions align with his isolation-driven pragmatism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the elevator's repetitive emptiness slightly weakens momentum. Cause-and-effect is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cavern cathedral's phosphorescent flora is vividly rendered, with sensory details (sap, bread scent) enhancing atmosphere and supporting the hermit's methods.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scissors, blood, bread) and subtext about isolation. Ending is purposeful, though the humor could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The grotesque alchemy of tools feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the surface world's neglect.</comment>
