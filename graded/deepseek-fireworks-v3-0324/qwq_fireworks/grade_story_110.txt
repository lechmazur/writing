<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys's motivations and backstory are subtly revealed through their actions and the lantern's significance, but the "hidden assassin" aspect feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each repair serving as a micro-narrative. The word limit is used masterfully, though the assassin thread is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shop's atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (dripping clocks, moss) enhancing the mood. The lantern's connection to time and secrets is brilliant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (moss as confession, clocks as lies). The ending lingers, though the assassin reveal slightly undermines the thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("knives wrapped in lace"). Only flaw: the assassin element feels grafted rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and haunting, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, though the assassin twist disrupts the tone.</comment>
