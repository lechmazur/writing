<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's restless nature and deceptive traits are well-integrated, driving his actions and decisions. His motivation to "sculpt a new tomorrow from ruin" is clear and consistent, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the lantern's visions driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete, though the ending slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (trembling glass, recycled air) enhancing the atmosphere. The lantern's connection to the setting is organic and reinforces the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lantern as hope, stitching as repair) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of endurance resonates deeply. Minor flaw: some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (light as sound) and no clich√©s. The narrative avoids predictability, and the style is distinctive. Only slight over-reliance on "grit" as a motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, prompting reflection on resilience. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
