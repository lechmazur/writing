<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, but his "amiable scholar" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his curiosity and obsession with merging lore.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the crossword and timbers driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details (creaking timbers, swirling mist) that elevate the setting. The lighthouse feels alive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (crossword as ritual, light as bridge) and a layered theme of merging realms. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("drowned leviathan") edge toward clich√©. The core concept feels fresh, and the prose avoids AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
