<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's fanatical puzzle-making and bitter optimism are vividly portrayed, with her motivations and actions tightly aligned. The string as a totem reveals her inner conflict effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from mystery to revelation. The lighthouse setting and packages drive the narrative logically, though the twist could be foreshadowed more subtly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and island create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (groaning rocks, frayed string) deepen the mood, perfectly complementing Clara's psychological unraveling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (mirrors, string) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "unsigned letter" reveal borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The twist of Clara mailing herself packages is fresh, though the "optimistically bitter" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about self-deception and redemption.</comment>
