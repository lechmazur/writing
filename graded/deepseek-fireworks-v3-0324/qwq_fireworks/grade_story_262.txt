<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ms. Veyra's alien nature and teacher disguise are compelling, but her motivation could be more nuanced. Her "righteously flawed" attribute is clear but slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the puzzle tile and organ frequencies driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rosemary, aged stone, organ reverberations) enhancing the atmosphere. The fusion of ancient and modern is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sound/stone language, bioluminescent scars) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though Kestrel's quick acceptance strains believability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The alien/human dynamic is nuanced, though some phrases ("messy, glorious chaos") verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
