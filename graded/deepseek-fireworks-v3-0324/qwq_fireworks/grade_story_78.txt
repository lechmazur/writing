<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Mira are vividly drawn, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Elias's late-blooming heroism and Mira's reluctant awe are compelling, though Mira's shift from skepticism to fear could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The seed bombs as a solution are inventive, though the rift's closure feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting is richly evoked, with sensory details (smog, rusted ships) enhancing the atmosphere. The rooftop farm and spyglass are seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spyglass as a map, seeds as rebirth) and lyrical prose. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the cosmic balance metaphor borders on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of cosmic decay and gardening is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Only minor quibble: "softly militant" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. The theme of growth as revolution is subtly powerful.</comment>
