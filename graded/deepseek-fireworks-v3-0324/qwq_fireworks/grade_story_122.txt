<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cyber-templar's motivation is clear but her "patiently frantic" attribute could be more deeply explored. Her voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the prism's role feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details (ozone, bone) and the sky burial site elevate the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (lightning as a "silver serpent") and a resonant ending. Theme of safety as illusion is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clichés. Only minor stiffness in the "euphoric agitation" tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering question about cyclical defiance.</comment>
