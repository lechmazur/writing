<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and consistent, with her jaded eagerness and defiance shining through. The glove and voice notes deepen her character, though her "dutiful ward" role could be more explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with auditions driving the mystery forward. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the final twist could be slightly more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cracked leather, shattered glass) amplifying the eerie atmosphere. The setting and tone are perfectly aligned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glove, phones, mirrors) and a haunting, layered theme elevate the story. The ending is both satisfying and provocative, with sharp stylistic choices.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and subverted tropes. The voice feels distinct, though a few phrases ("graceless beauty") edge toward overused lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering unease and thematic weight.</comment>
