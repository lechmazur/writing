<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as a careful poisoner is clear, but her shift to bending her code feels slightly abrupt. Her "innocently guilty" attribute is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the scavenger hunt, but the skateboarding element feels tangential. The ending's twist is strong, though the pacing wobbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the skatepark clashes tonally. Sensory details (leather, dust, ash) are excellent, though the "dusty starlight" motif is overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier as warning) and subtext. The ending lingers, but some metaphors ("code of instinct") feel underdeveloped. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists (e.g., skateboarders solving the hunt). Avoids clich√©s, though the poisoner angle could be more nuanced. Language is purposeful, not purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite eclectic elements. The brief length works, but the skateboarding feels like a forced inclusion. Leaves a haunting question about guilt and truth.</comment>
