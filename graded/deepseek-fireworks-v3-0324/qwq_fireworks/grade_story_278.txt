<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor's brooding nature and artistic sensitivity are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, though his transition from laborer to escape artist could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dust's anomaly driving the climax logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the foreman's role feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crater base and dust phenomenon create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (acid-yellow residue, rust-red sky) are particularly striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glasses as weapon, dust as portal) and a haunting ending elevate this beyond mere plot. The theme of art as liberation resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The dust's "Möbius strip" motion and the sculptor's vibration method are inventive. Minor stiffness in "webs of intrigue."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. The brevity feels intentional, and the lingering image of the phantom hand is masterful.</comment>
