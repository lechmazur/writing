<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The somnambulist scout's motivation is clear and consistent, her humility and connection to the land well-established. However, her 'voice' lacks distinctiveness in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptionalâ€”sensory details (algae, petrichor, bioluminescence) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lightning bugs as forest breath) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict is subtle to the point of near-absence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("fossilized organs") edge toward purple prose. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
