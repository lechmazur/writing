<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn's obsession with stamps and her compulsion to hoard rather than explore are well-integrated into her motivation and actions, though her "ravenously gentle" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect relationships and a satisfying arc. The bootleg recordings as a method of reconnection are inventive, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bicycle-powered carnival and faded orchard sign create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (garnet dust, creaking Ferris wheel) enhance the mood and support the story's magical realism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps, luggage tag, garnet) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the magician's backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The combination of elements feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful, though the phrase "ravenously gentle" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
