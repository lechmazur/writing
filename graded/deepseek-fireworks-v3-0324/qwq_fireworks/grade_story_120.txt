<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ethan's guilt and motivation are vividly portrayed, with the fishing lure serving as a powerful symbol of his trauma. His actions and dialogue reveal depth, though his "voice" could be slightly more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the loop device driving momentum. Pacing is excellent, though the quantum tunnel's logic could be slightly clearer. Resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel's eerie atmosphere is masterfully evoked through sensory details (ozone, static). The setting amplifies Ethan's emotional state and the story's surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (lure, raindrop) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Writing style elevates the narrative with lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The "excited boredom" tone is fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "nest") are inventive. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and deeply human.</comment>
