<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with her subdued nature and vigilante role well-integrated. The wooden bead and mentor's death deepen her backstory, though her "artfully clumsy" attribute could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mirror's distortions, but the sniper confrontation feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and funhouse mirror create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, fogged screen) are evocative, but the "screaming silence" tone occasionally overpowers subtler moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext ("truth in distortions"). The ending is purposeful, though the theme of war's cost could be more layered. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (light’s lies), but some phrases verge on flowery. The vigilante trope is subverted well, though the "ancient art" concept risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the mirror and bead serving the narrative elegantly. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on war’s aftermath.</comment>
