<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maggie's motivation is clear and consistent, with her assertively meek demeanor and desperate optimism driving her actions. Her interaction with the tapestry and card reveals depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tapestry's transformation and the card's coordinates logically driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The desert setting and mirage motif are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (smoke, gold threads) immerse the reader, though the timeframe's connection to the fireworks feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tapestry as map, labyrinth as cycle) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, with thematic resonance about escape and hope. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The tapestry's magic and the card's transformation feel inventive. Nuanced emotion and subtext prevent the story from feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, serving the story's cohesion. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth. A standout piece with minor room for polish.</comment>
