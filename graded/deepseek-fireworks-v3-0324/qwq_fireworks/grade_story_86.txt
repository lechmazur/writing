<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's apprehension and archer background are intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation is clear but his "exceptional" skill feels inconsistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the balloon festival feels abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cyberpunk setting and "borrowed dawn" tone are vividly rendered, but the ancient timeline element is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance, though the stranger's dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of cyberpunk and mysticism, though the candle's role edges toward clich√©. Nuanced handling of compassion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the archer motif feels slightly forced. Lingering thematic impact elevates it.</comment>
