<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eryk's motivation is clear and consistent, with his longing for escape and the ladle's significance deeply tied to his character. His "openly private" nature and ritualistic actions reveal a nuanced, introspective personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the meteorite and ladle driving the narrative toward a transformative climax. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The giant's dining hall is vividly rendered, with sensory details (soot, thunderous laughter) amplifying the atmosphere. The meteorite and ladle are seamlessly integrated into the setting, enhancing the story's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ladle as key, meteorite as bridge) and subtext (silence as power). The ending is hauntingly evocative, leaving room for interpretation while feeling complete.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The ladle's transformation and the meteorite's "memory" are fresh concepts. Prose is lyrical but purposeful, with no AI-generated artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
