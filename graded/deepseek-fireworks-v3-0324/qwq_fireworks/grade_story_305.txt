<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reticence and scholarly nature are well-integrated, but her "technically mischievous" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her motivation to "dethrone complacency" is compelling but could be more explicitly tied to her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the knock and sketches driving the narrative logically. The ending feels purposeful, though the cake-baking thread is slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the tablet's warmth, the chorus swelling) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (e.g., the sinking tablet, the cake as a failed ritual) and a memorable ending elevate the story. The theme of reviving forgotten voices is poignant and well-executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "technically mischievous" trait leans slightly generic. The prose avoids clich√©s, and the emotional resonance feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
