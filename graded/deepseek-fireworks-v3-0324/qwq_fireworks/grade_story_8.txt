<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and compelling, blending aristocratic duty with intellectual rebellion. His actions align well with his empirically rebellious nature, though his "dazed" quality could be more consistently woven into his decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Silas's chalked symbols driving the narrative forward organically. The ending feels purposeful, though the transition from solitary rebellion to communal participation could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (shattered violin chimes, vibrating gongs) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements the theme of logic and madness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (Fibonacci spirals, Rorschach blots) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the composer's abrupt appearance feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors and a distinct voice. The blending of math and myth feels inventive, and the prose avoids clich√© while maintaining clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving the reader with lingering questions about legacy and rebellion.</comment>
