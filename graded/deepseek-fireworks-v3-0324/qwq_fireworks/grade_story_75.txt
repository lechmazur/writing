<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira's guarded nature and motivation to revive extinct crafts are clear and compelling, though her "skeptically credulous" trait could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the decryption of vows driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's themes. Bioluminescent details and lichen-based encryption add immersive texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bookmark, lute) and subtext (erasure vs. preservation). The ending resonates with thematic depth and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of sci-fi and historical rebellion tropes. Fresh metaphors ("anger simmered beneath her usual calm") avoid clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by its length or assigned components.</comment>
