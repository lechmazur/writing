<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his backstory feels slightly rushed. His "poetically rational" attribute is well-integrated but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels abrupt. The connection between the orchard and the politician's downfall could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground orchard and bio-luminescent fungus create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the orchestra's role is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks emotional punch. The theme of control vs. chaos is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The sandals and journals are fresh, but the politician's reveal feels familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit strains the depth. The elements serve the story well, but the ending lingers too briefly.</comment>
