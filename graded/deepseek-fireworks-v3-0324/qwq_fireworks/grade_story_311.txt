<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His stubbornness and emotional connection to the photograph add depth, though his "serendipitously stubborn" attribute could be more explicitly woven into key moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each overheard fragment logically advancing Kael's quest. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "rebirth" reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered, with Earthlight and crater edges enhancing the tension. Sensory details (pollen, visor adjustments) deepen immersion, though more auditory texture could heighten atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (withering vines, stardust fragments) and subtext (syndicate control vs. rebirth). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with Kael's anger and serenity balanced deftly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. The syndicate's lies and Kael's resolve feel fresh, though "timely rebirth" edges toward trope territory. Language is purposeful, with minimal excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity serves the story's urgency, and the lunar setting elevates the personal stakes. Leaves a lingering question about the sister's fate.</comment>
