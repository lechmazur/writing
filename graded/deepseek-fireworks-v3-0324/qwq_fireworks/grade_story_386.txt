<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her identity as a time refugee, but her "trustworthy strange" attribute could be more explicitly woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the catapult action driving the resolution logically. The word limit is well-managed, though the star alignment method feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" tone create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., salt-air dusk, glowing threads) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tablecloth as map/shroud) and a bittersweet ending elevate the story. The theme of fleeting legacy is poignant and well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "alignment of the stars" leans slightly tropey. The prose avoids purple tendencies, balancing lyricism with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
