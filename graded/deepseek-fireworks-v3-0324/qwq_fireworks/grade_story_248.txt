<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's "coyly furious" attitude and motivation to clear the prophecy's fog are well-integrated, but her synthetic nature could be explored deeper for richer nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with urgency and cause-effect clarity. The method of reassembling letters feels organic, though the climax resolution could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the freighter's decay and colliding worlds enhancing tension. The bird's brass feathers and flickering lights are standout sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bird as guilt, fog as blindness) and a resonant ending. The "cheerless ecstasy" tone is striking but could be more consistently woven earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "shadows like skeletal fingers"). Minor risk of "fog" as a prophecy trope, but subverted effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate. The sacrifice theme lingers, though the sentinelâ€™s synthetic voice could be more distinct.</comment>
