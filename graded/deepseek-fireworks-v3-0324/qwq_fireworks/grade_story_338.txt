<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The zany artificer's detachment and motivation to find beauty in the mundane are clear and consistent, but her 'zany' trait could be more vividly demonstrated through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the rotary phone and call logs driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subway tunnels and folding time create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (grime, static, echoes) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices (metaphor, symbolism). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of 'breaking stereotypes' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the 'zany' descriptor feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder about hidden beauty.</comment>
