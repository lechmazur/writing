<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "furiously tranquil" phrasing risks feeling contrived. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally overreaches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette that lingers. The word limit feels deliberate, though the envoy's transformation could be more earned.</comment>
