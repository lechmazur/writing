<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Corin's earnestness and motivation are clear, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His realization about the greenhouse's connection to his mentor adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution of the celestial alignment could be more explicit. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (cracked leather, decaying sap) enhancing the atmosphere. The ruined aqueduct and greenhouse are brilliantly interconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (constellations, scars) and a resonant theme of renewal elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "canvas of life" metaphor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "unknowingly familiar" attribute leans on tropes. The prose avoids clich√©s, though the knight archetype is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression of renewal and legacy.</comment>
