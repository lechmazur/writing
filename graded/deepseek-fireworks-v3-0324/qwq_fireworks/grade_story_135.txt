<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the poster's bruises logically guiding the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are richly evocative, enhancing the story's melancholy tone. Sensory details (e.g., broth's taste) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (straw as a bridge) and subtext (isolation vs. preservation). The ending lingers, and the theme of cultural loss is poignant.</comment>
