<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apothecary's sorrow and desperation are palpable, but his motivation to decode the dream catchers feels slightly rushed. His attachment to the spoon is a strong emotional anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The bifurcation choice is a brilliant pivot, though the library's time constraint could be more organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fortress and desert are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sand, crumbling spoon) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the apothecary's isolation and urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spoon as relic, dream catchers as keys) and layered themes (grief, sacrifice) elevate the story. The ending is haunting but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "silent oracle" trope is familiar. The prose avoids clich√©s, but the "joy and sorrow fused" moment edges toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, though the oracle's resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>
