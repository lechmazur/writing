<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The jester's melancholy and motivation to restore sacred practices are clear and consistent, but his "iconically unintentional" attribute feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the tea-leaf method's connection to the resolution could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the submarine's decay and paint fumes enhancing the jester's quest. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (triangles, cerulean paint) and subtext (rituals vs. practicality) are compelling, but the ending's hopeful note slightly undercuts the melancholy tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The jester's role and steampunk setting feel inventive, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about faith versus function.</comment>
