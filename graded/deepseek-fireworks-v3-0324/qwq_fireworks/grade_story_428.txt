<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The ink blotter as a symbol of his father's rigidity is strong, but his "rarely authentic" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the dealer's appearance feels abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the temple's setting enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (dust, ink, light) are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is masterful, with rich symbolism and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of embracing uncertainty is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "chains of certainty") are fresh, and the prose is purposeful without being ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story rather than feeling forced. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
