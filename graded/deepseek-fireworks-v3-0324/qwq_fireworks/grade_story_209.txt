<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to his sister's memory. His actions and reactions reveal a complex mix of grief, guilt, and determination, though his "seasoned woodsman" trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the hairbrush and radio garden driving the narrative forward logically. The ending resolves the emotional arc while leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is a stunning, evocative setting that enhances the story's surreal tone. Sensory details (static, rust, buzzing) immerse the reader brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (brush as conduit, railways as stories) and subtext (grief as a hidden path). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of electromagnetic mysticism and personal grief feels fresh. Language is vivid but purposeful, with nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
