<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kellan's calm demeanor contrasts effectively with the eerie setting, but his motivation to "mold a myth" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect, though the twist's execution slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humidity, snapping jaws) amplifying the atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s mythic theme. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts beg expansion.</comment>
