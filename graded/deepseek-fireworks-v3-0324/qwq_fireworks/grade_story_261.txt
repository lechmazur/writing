<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's borderline immortality and rigid flexibility are compellingly integrated into her actions and worldview, though her motivation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spilled ink's patterns and the earbud chip driving a coherent, resonant arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden and its decay are vividly rendered, with sensory details (corroded circuits, quantum sap) elevating the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ink as map, earbud as relic) and subtext (cycles of failure). The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of sci-fi and ecological allegory. Language is precise yet poetic, avoiding clich√©. The bitter laughter tone is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
