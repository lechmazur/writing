<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. Her "voice" is distinct, though her internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The seashell's role as a catalyst is logical, but the witch's sudden appearance could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The garage setting is inventive but slightly incongruous with the corridor's tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the garage feels slightly out of place.</comment>
