<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from fraud to seer is compelling, but her "peaceful anger" could be more vividly explored to deepen her emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the flute and archive serving as strong anchors, though the "taken chances" motif feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive's atmosphere is richly evoked, but the "planting season" timeframe is underutilized despite its thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext, with the flute's visions and extinct languages merging into a resonant theme of rebirth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "regularly seldom" phrasing feels forced, and the tone occasionally wavers between poetic and overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting narrative that lingers, though some elements (like "peaceful anger") could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
