<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel's motivation is clear and consistent, with her "weirdness" driving her actions. Her distinct voice and alignment with her inventor traits stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the escalator metaphor feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk alley is vividly rendered with sensory details. The setting enhances the action and mood, though the "neon haze" trope is borderline clich√©.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shards, hammer scars) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "kaleidoscope of hope" verges on sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in Kestrel's tools and the "ruthless kindness" theme. Some phrases ("dying fireflies") feel recycled, but the core concept is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. Only minor nitpicks prevent a perfect score.</comment>
