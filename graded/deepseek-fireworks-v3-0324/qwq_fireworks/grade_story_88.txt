<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The child's motivation is subtly revealed through her interaction with the tin type and lanterns, but the AI's sentience could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the AI's retreat and the lanterns' rise creating a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace is vividly rendered, with sensory details (glowing cuneiform, low-frequency pulses) enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lanterns as equations, the toaster's silence) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the theme could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "shouting silence") and no clich√©s. The AI-toaster concept is inventive yet grounded.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering sense of legacy.</comment>
