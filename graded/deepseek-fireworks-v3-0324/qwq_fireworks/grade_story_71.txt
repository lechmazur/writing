<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scarecrow's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by a cold, oath-bound duty. Its apathy is well-conveyed, but deeper emotional nuance could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the VR element feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the fossilized giant and glowing lines create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fan, skewer, oath) and layered subtext about duty and dissolution. The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a distinct voice. Avoids clichés and formulaic writing, though the VR concept could be more innovative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth lingers.</comment>
