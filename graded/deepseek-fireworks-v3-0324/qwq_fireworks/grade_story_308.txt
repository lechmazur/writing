<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's dual identity as a bashful caretaker and former executioner is compelling, but his transition could be more nuanced. The keychain motif effectively ties his past and present.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the "Wave’s Embrace" sequence serving as a pivotal moment. Pacing is excellent, though the festival's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating studio and festival lanterns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (seagull’s screech, plastic edges of the keychain) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (keychain, tides) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though Lira’s sketch could be more integrated earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("benign ferocity"). Avoids clichés, though the executioner trope risks predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
