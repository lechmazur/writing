<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, her "quietly loud" presence and indifference sharpening her exorcist role. Her distinct voice and actions align well with her curiosity-driven pursuit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the receipt driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and neon-lit alley create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon glow, pixelated tears) enhance the eerie, digital-ghost theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (ghosts as data, curiosity as survival) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending lingers, and literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are deftly employed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (digital exorcism) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and maintains a consistent, distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story feels deliberate and layered. Leaves a haunting question about the "next address," suggesting depth.</comment>
