<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey's impassivity and subtle emotional cracks are well-developed, but his motivation to witness grace could be more explicitly tied to his backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the twist tie and bees driving the narrative, though the "oil changes" framing feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion is breathtakingly vivid, with sensory details (honey, damp wood) deepening the eerie, organic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (twist tie as cathedral ribs) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the endingâ€™s return to duty slightly softens its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Only minor quibble: "oil changes" risks feeling like a forced prompt element.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
