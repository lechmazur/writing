<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's timidity and motivation are clear, but "seraphic seamstress" feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her promise to Kael.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The ribbon and scoreboard weave logically into the resolution, though the "overtake" action is subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—factory, arcade, and holographic temple blend seamlessly. Sensory details (whistle, ribbon's burn) enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: symbolism (ribbon as thread, scoreboard as loom), emotional resonance, and a hauntingly hopeful ending. Theme of healing through memory is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic. Avoids clichés; metaphors (e.g., "loom") feel fresh. Nuanced handling of grief and timid courage.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Lingers in the mind—especially the holographic temple and "BEGIN AGAIN."</comment>
