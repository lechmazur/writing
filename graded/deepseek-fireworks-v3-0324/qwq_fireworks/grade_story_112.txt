<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear and consistent, but her 'aimless' nature feels slightly at odds with her focused pursuit of recipes. The handkerchief's significance is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hopscotch board as a clever device. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed. The archive's sensory descriptions elevate the story's mood and align perfectly with the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of 'mournful elation' could be more explicitly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases border on overly poetic. The hopscotch-as-recipe conceit is fresh, though the 'seeds of vigilance' metaphor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering impression of preservation as both loss and renewal.</comment>
