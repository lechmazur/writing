<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his lumberjack background with his quest for healing traditions. His "gracefully awkward" nature adds depth, though his dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coded letter driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the gala climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is vividly rendered, with sensory details (chandeliers, skeletal art) enhancing the eerie yet refined atmosphere. The setting deeply influences the plot and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bones as memory, roots as healing) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though Lira's shift could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of gourmet dining and ossuary lore is inventive, though some metaphors ("whispering bones") verge on familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Leaves a lingering thematic impact on memory and healing.</comment>
