<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observer's "aggressively kind" nature is compelling but their motivation to rescue traditions could be more deeply explored. Their actions align well, but their distinct voice is somewhat muted by the poetic prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the dancer's step and whale's call driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and oceanic atmosphere are masterfully evoked, with sensory details (whale's thrum, salt-stained walls) enhancing the eerie, mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as relic, dancer as key) and layered themes (tradition as bridge) elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the conflict's resolution leans poetic over concrete.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("aggressively kind") verge on repetitive. The whale-dancer-lighthouse triad feels fresh, though the observer's role risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the whistle and whale's call feeling indispensable. The brevity serves the mythic tone, leaving a lingering question about unbound traditions.</comment>
