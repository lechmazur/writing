<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and compelling, but the "trickster" aspect feels underdeveloped. The lawyer's internal conflict and connection to his sister add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the "stretching" timeframe feels slightly forced. The dares drive momentum effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Biodome setting is vividly rendered, and the bioluminescent vines enhance the ghostly tone. Sensory details (whispering leaves, shimmering air) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (gift tag, cornstalks as glyphs) and emotional resonance. The ending lingers, though Marcus's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (languages as crops). Minor stiffness in dialogue ("Choose wisely") but avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the word limit feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question about sacrifice and preservation.</comment>
