<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Liora's complex motivations and contradictions (obsession vs. vision, pruning as metaphor) are deeply woven into her actions and voice, though her final decision feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's tension between surface and hidden truths is masterfully paced, but the resolution's symbolic weight slightly overrides logistical clarity (e.g., how apprentices are deceived).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard and solar panels create a haunting, layered atmosphere; sensory details (sap, moth-wing leather) elevate the worldbuilding beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: pruning as extended metaphor, disclaimers as subtext, and the finale's emotional ambiguity resonate deeply. Only the handshake's meaning feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, idiosyncratic voice with minimal cliché; "bittersweet grit" and "compass spinning between duty and betrayal" showcase originality. Minor over-reliance on pruning as symbol.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A nearly flawless cohesion of elements; the length feels intentional, leaving just enough unresolved. The river’s edge as final boundary lingers brilliantly.</comment>
