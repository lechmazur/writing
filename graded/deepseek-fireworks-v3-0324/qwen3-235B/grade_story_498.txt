<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kingpin's nervousness and internal conflict are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct shift in perspective. His actions align with his arc, though his transformation could be slightly more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the detour feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc resolves satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with sensory details (brittle pods, thawing earth) that deepen the setting. The enclave's xenophobia and midwinter tension are expertly woven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (seed pods as defiance) and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of resistance against indifference resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Fresh metaphors ("arithmetic of roots") and nuanced emotion. No AI artifice; style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered despite constraints. Leaves a lingering impactâ€”thematic depth elevates it beyond the plot.</comment>
