<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's gloom and motivation ("to collect lost lullabies") are vividly portrayed, though his sacrifices (selling his firstborn’s name) could feel overstated without deeper emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc (containment attempt → success/debt), though the facility’s role could be more explicitly tied to the orchard’s survival.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—bioluminescent trees, stolen water, and the skull’s artificial sinews create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (e.g., "rust blade buried in the ribs of a desert") and subtext (sacrifice vs. artifice) elevate the narrative. Ending is poignant but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("lullabies scattered to the void") and no clichés. Tone and style are distinctively crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story masterfully, leaving a lingering question about the cost of artifice. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
