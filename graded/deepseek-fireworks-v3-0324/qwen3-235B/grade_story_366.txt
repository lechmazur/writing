<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's telepathy and her grandmother's button hook are seamlessly integrated into her motivation, revealing depth and consistency. Her "efficiently inefficient" precision and stubborn persistence make her compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with glacial cipher-solving method driving urgency. Pacing is brisk yet immersive, though the solstice climax could use slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The dock’s oily mechanics and brittle archives create a vivid, sensory-rich contrast to Lira’s frostbound revelations. The equinox’s metallic tang is masterfully atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brilliant subtext: coffee as glacial strata, the button hook as generational defiance. Ending resonates—ice crystals mirror transient nobility. Only flaw: foreman’s mockery feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original—no tropes, no clichés. "Secrets stitched in frost" and "foolish nobility" are fresh, precise. Emotional depth is shown through tactile details (moth-eaten scarf, rusted locker).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the theme of buried truths. The brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with Lira’s quiet defiance against pragmatic oblivion.</comment>
