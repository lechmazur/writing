<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hushed necromancer's motivation and personality are vividly rendered, with their love for old movies and spectral interactions adding depth. Their resolve is clear, though the "hushed" aspect could be more consistently emphasized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cave exploration and Heart of Glass discovery forming a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent, though Sam's reactivation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave's atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with bioluminescent fungi and spectral miners enriching the mood. Sensory details are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like the cap's symbolism and the projector's hum elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the thematic depth of "dominating oblivion" could be slightly sharper.</comment>
