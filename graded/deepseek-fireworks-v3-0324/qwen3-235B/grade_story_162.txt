<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jack's carefree gambler persona is vividly portrayed, and his motivation shifts believably from indifference to deeper stakes. However, his "uniquely trustworthy" attribute feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The harmonizer twist elevates the stakes, though the widow's role could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The workshop and island settings are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (static, rust, rain) deepening immersion. The hush of old tapes subtly reinforces the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "cards falling like pieces of a blueprint") are deftly employed. The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous, though the theme of trust could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, though the "island memories" element feels underdeveloped. Avoids clich√©s, but the harmonizer's reveal leans slightly generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering questions about chaos and control.</comment>
