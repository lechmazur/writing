<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian's motivations are deeply nuanced, revealing a complex interplay of resentment, regret, and hollow triumph. Her 'hyperactively serene' demeanor masks her inner turmoil effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, though the steampunk setting occasionally distracts from the emotional core. The mixtapes as a method of revelation are poignant but slightly overexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly rendered, but its grandeur occasionally overshadows the intimacy of the librarian's emotional reckoning. Sensory details (steam, adhesive, static) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's layered subtext—forgiveness as a "hidden track," preservation as erasure—elevates it. The ending's unresolved tension is haunting, though the prose occasionally veers into purple.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though the steampunk trappings feel slightly grafted. The librarian's voice is distinct, but the "savage grace" tone wobbles between restraint and melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story's cohesion is impressive given its thematic density. The stickers and mixtapes linger in the mind, though the steampunk setting feels less integral than the emotional archaeology.</comment>
