<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steward's quiet defiance and layered motivation (rejecting conformity, vowing to "tend the cracks") are compellingly etched. His actions align with his stoicism and rebellion, though his backstory could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with the cameo's revelation and the cellar's discovery driving momentum. Pacing is brisk but not rushed, though the orchard's closure could be more vividly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The museum's artificiality and the orchard's cloying decay are masterfully rendered. Sensory details (overripe apples, holographic sun) amplify the atmosphere, making the setting a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cameo as covenant, seeds as rebellion) elevates the text. The ending lingers, balancing cynicism and hope. Only minor quibble: the AI's "saccharine" alert feels slightly on-the-nose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no tropes, no clichés. The "unapproved seeds" metaphor and the steward's transformation into the cameo are strikingly fresh. Language is precise, never purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, with each detail serving the theme of rebellion within decay. Leaves the reader haunted by its imagery.</comment>
