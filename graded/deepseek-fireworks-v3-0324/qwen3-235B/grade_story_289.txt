<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, her actions reveal depth, and her voice is distinct. However, her social clumsiness feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the storm's arrival feels abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bay and Xyrian ruins are vividly rendered. Sensory details (mud, algae, doll's hum) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. No clich√©s, but "madwater artist" leans slightly predictable. Style is purposeful and evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize beautifully. Story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingering theme of resilience lingers powerfully.</comment>
