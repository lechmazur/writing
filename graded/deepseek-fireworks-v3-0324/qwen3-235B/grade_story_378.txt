<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Boran's grumpy yet redeemable nature is clear, and his accidental mayoralty lends depth. His motivation to address the swamp's sickness feels consistent and drives the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the beetle's theft and the swamp's transformation forming a coherent arc. Pacing is strong despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The swamp orchard is vividly rendered with sensory details (sludge, iridescent algae) that enhance the atmosphere. The monks' vanishing adds mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (beetle as salvation, monks' transformation) and a resonant ending elevate this. The story "shows" far more than it "tells."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The clockwork beetle and reluctant redemption arc feel uniquely crafted, not AI-generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a story that lingers. The brief length feels deliberate, with no wasted words.</comment>
