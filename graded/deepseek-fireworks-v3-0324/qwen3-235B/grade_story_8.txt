<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The noble's rebellious empiricism and grief-driven drive to reconcile logic and myth are compelling, but their transformation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arcs elegantly from rebellion to synthesis, with the chalk's vanishing and the sibling's letter as masterful pivot points. Minor pacing quibbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sound garden is a transcendent setting—wind chimes and bleeding ears merge sensory detail with thematic resonance. Only the "between lectures" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stunning craft: the child's humming as proof of the curse's theorem, the glyph as both equation and elegy. Subtext about control vs. creation lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the chalk-as-relic and silence-as-sound concepts. A few phrases ("cosmic dance") verge on cliché but are redeemed by context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements, with the chalk and garden elevating each other. The length feels deliberate, the ending hauntingly open.</comment>
