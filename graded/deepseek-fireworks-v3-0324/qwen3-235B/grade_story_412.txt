<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The assassin's intellectual and violent duality is compelling, with his geographic flaw and mourning for the old order adding depth. His motivation is clear but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly wound, with nightmares serving as both guide and trap. Pacing is brisk but balanced, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The station's eerie, static-charged atmosphere is masterfully rendered. Sensory details (hummingbooks, rubber key warmth) heighten immersion and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (dissolving the keeper, recursive nightmares) and layered symbolism elevate the story. The ending lingers, though some metaphors verge on overstuffed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original blend of esoteric lore and cybernetic dread. Minor stumbles in tonal consistency ("mournful elation" wobbles near the end).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, daring tale that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of cyclical erasure.</comment>
