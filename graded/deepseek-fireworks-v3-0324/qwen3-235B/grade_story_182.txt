<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s surreal logic is cohesive, with the spoon’s revelation and mural’s animation driving the arc elegantly. Pacing is tight but immersive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A nearly flawless fusion of elements. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant questions about inheritance and chaos.</comment>
