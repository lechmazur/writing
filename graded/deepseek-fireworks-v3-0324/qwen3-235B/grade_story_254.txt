<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's internal conflict and paradoxical nature (humorless comedian) are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to bottle a star’s breath feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, though the transition from gifts to star’s breath is abrupt. Pacing is strong within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—deserted playground and wilderness enhance the story’s melancholic tone. Sensory details (cracked sandbox, rusted swings) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of inkwell, crows as audience) and a hauntingly purposeful ending. Subtext about artistic decline is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "punchlines fossilized"). Avoids clichés and demonstrates nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of poetic resignation.</comment>
