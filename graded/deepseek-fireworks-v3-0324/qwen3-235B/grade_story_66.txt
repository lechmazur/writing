<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The character’s quiet guilt and transformation into a gardener are deeply resonant, though his internal conflict could benefit from slightly more explicit anchoring in specific memories.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot’s circular structure and thematic resolution are strong, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the transition from desertion to redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion and emotional impact are nearly flawless, with every element serving the central theme of redemption through dissolution.</comment>
