<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her past failures, but her "coy" nature could be more vividly shown through dialogue or action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear cause-effect chain, though the time-reversal mechanics risk slight confusion in such a short format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brewery’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (iron, elderflower) enhancing the witch’s eerie benevolence. The reversed-time core is brilliantly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (button, elixir) and subtext. The ending’s paradox is haunting, though the witch’s final dialogue edges toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The witch’s “diabolically benevolent” trait could be subtler, and Lys’s emotional arc slightly telegraphs its beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. The length feels deliberate, with every element serving the story’s depth. Lingers on themes of sacrifice and unintended consequences.</comment>
