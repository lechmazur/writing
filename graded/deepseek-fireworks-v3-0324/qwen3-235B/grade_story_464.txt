<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's sass and academic mischief are vividly portrayed, driving her actions consistently. Her motivation to disrupt order is clear, though her backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot coheres well, with a clear arc from soufflés to reality unraveling. Pacing is brisk but effective; the "fracture" action is compelling, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The office-as-calibration-lab setting is brilliantly surreal, enhanced by sensory details (wet newspapers, glittering static). Atmosphere drips with subversive whimsy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext (burnt sugar as rigidity, entropy as rebellion). The ending lingers—Dali-esque and defiant. Dialogue is sparse but sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice; avoids tropes. Phrases like "reality peeling like overcooked pastry" defy AI-generic blandness. Emotional nuance in Lila's smirk-and-scars bravado.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, stylized whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for the reader’s imagination to savor the chaos.</comment>
