<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The duelist's transformation from rigid precision to elastic forgiveness is compelling, though their initial motivation could be more explicitly tied to their past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect logic is strong, with the chest’s mutations driving the duelist’s arc. Pacing is tight but not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting’s decayed-tech atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (ozone, mildew) deepening the mood. The spaceport’s abandonment mirrors the duelist’s isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (recipes as metaphors for healing) and a resonant theme (forgiveness as innovation) elevate the prose. The ending is both poignant and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "elasticized soul") and a surprising twist on "family recipes" avoid cliché. The voice feels distinct, not AI-generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the chest’s mutations serving as the narrative spine. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
