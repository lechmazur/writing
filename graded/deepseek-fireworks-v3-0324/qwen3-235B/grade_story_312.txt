<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mayor's agoraphobia and inherited burden are compellingly woven into his actions, though his sudden resolve feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly coiled, with the snuffbox's reveal and the dunes' whispers driving momentum. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant unanswered questions.</comment>
