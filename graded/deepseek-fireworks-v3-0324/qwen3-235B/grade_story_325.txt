<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mad botanist's motivation is clear and vividly portrayed, with his obsession and fickle loyalty to Clive adding depth. His actions align well with his deranged yet methodical personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the belt and film reel driving the action coherently. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and eerie, with sensory details (pollen-smeared goggles, crackling film) enhancing the high-altitude tea house's mystique. The setting and concept harmonize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices (the belt as relic, Clive as unreliable ally), the story lingers. The ending is purposeful, and the conflict—betrayal vs. ambition—resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes with fresh metaphors (ionized nectar, spectral anomalies). The mad scientist archetype feels revitalized, and the prose is vivid without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly, serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting impression of the mountain’s “hidden veins.”</comment>
