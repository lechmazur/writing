<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The troubadour's grief and motivation are deeply intertwined, his actions and reactions revealing a nuanced, haunted psyche. His distinct voice and the collar's symbolism enhance his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coherent, with the demystification of the "heartbeat" driving a clear arc. Pacing is effective, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chamber's oppressive silence and star-etched ceiling create a vividly immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glass floor, static) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Richly layered with symbolism (collar as dirge, stars as scars) and emotional resonance. The ending lingers, blending elegy and revelation masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "hungry silence") and a unique voice avoid clichés. The handling of grief feels authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The brevity serves the story’s intensity, leaving a resonant afterimage.</comment>
