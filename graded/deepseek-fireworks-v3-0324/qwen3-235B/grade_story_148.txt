<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The storm chaser's desert-hardened pragmatism and past failures are well-integrated into their motivation, though their "eagerly unwilling" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with decoding the tapestry and restoring the carousel forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the final resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and carousel setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (frost-laced gravel, screaming wind) enhancing the atmosphere. The tapestry and tongs are meaningfully connected to the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tongs as relics, carousel as resurrection) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending's theme—strength in surrender—is poignant, though the abbot's dialogue feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors (threads echoing storm logic) and nuanced emotion avoid cliché. Minor stylistic overreach ("匠’s precision" feels forced).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering meditation on control vs. chaos. The brief length feels intentional, not constrained.</comment>
