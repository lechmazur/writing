<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight, with the scalpel and receipts driving the narrative elegantly, though the reactor climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab and fireworks create a vivid, tension-laden atmosphere; sensory details like the crystals' hum and smoggy dawn are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scalpel as map, crystals as time), a resonant theme of redemption, and an ending that lingers. Almost flawless craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "optimistic desperation" wobbles in execution. Avoids clich√©s but risks melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly; the word limit feels intentional. Leaves the reader haunted by its question of fate.</comment>
