<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear and consistently tied to her background, but her "aimless" nature feels slightly underdeveloped given the depth of her quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the hopscotch board serving as a brilliant bridge between memory and discovery. Pacing is exceptional for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The archive's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (chalk dust, parchment scent) elevating the setting to a character itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the hopscotch-as-cipher concept. Only minor quibbles: "seeds of vigilance" proverb feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for the reader's imagination to fill gaps.</comment>
