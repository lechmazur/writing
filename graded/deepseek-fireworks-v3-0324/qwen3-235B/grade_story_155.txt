<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The welder's motivations and reactions are vividly rendered, with her "patiently impatient" demeanor and deep connection to the button box revealing layers of her psyche. However, her distinct voice could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the button box's unraveling driving the narrative forward. Pacing is excellent, though the timeline collisions could be slightly clearer in their cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stellar—the broken planetarium-nightclub hybrid and fractured neon constellations create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (saltwater, static hum) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative and layered, with potent symbolism (gears, ouroboros) and a haunting ending. Theme of mending vs. breaking realities resonates deeply. Minor quibble: some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "pamper the chaos" twist and nonlinear structure feel fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., the child's absence) are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story organically. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice and survival. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
