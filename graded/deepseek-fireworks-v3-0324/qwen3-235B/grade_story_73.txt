<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gravedigger's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "diligently whimsical" nature could be more consistently shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (copal incense, diesel, shattered glass) and setting (Aztec shrine vs. modernity) create a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly evocative prose with rich symbolism (magnifying glass as a bridge between eras). Ending is poignant, though the "blood on his lips" feels slightly melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("wind’s keening wail to stitch the rift"). Minor quibble: "kindrelize" risks feeling contrived despite thematic relevance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. Lingers in the mind—especially the blurred boundaries between epochs.</comment>
