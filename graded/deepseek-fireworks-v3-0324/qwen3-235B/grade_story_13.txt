<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The swordsman's motivation is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. His solemnity is consistent, but his internal conflict or growth isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with each clue logically leading to the next. The resolution feels earned, though slightly abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details (rust, bioluminescence, shifting sands) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of the box, garden as archive) and a haunting ending leave a lasting impression. Subtext about time and preservation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Some phrases border on overly ornate, but the core ideas are fresh and thoughtfully executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the theme. It lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond the word limit.</comment>
