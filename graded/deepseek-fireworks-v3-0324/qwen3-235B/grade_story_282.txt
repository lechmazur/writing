<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's brashness and wildness are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation (preserving tradition) driving his actions. His distinct voice and consistent reactions to the medal's transformation reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the detonation serving as a pivotal moment. Pacing is strong, though the child's introduction feels slightly abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic is solid.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The discount store setting and "dusty exuberance" tone are masterfully intertwined, enhancing the alchemical atmosphere. Sensory details (sparks, cinnamon rolls) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (nautilus spiral as rebirth) and subtext (violence transmuted into play) elevate the story. The ending is poignant, with Kael's laughter underscoring thematic defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (metal shrieking like a gull) are fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, through Kael's blistered hands and the child's awe.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant question: Can creation outlast decay? Style and theme are mutually reinforcing.</comment>
