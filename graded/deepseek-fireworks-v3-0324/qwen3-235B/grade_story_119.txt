<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation and traits are vividly portrayed, with her astral projection skills and compassion clearly driving her actions. Her 'voice' is distinct, though some backstory feels implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled and logical, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (lever freeing the boy) could use slightly more buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with striking sensory details (e.g., "teeth like fractured mirrors"). The carnival setting enhances the eerie, otherworldly tension perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (key, hourglass) and subtext ("compassion is a compass"). The ending lingers, and the theme of mercy as sacrifice resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The astral predators and celestial logic of the key are particularly inventive. Some phrases border on overly poetic but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where every element serves the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the themes linger beyond the final line.</comment>
