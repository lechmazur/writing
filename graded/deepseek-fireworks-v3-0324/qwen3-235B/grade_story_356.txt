<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The caretaker's wry, warmly aloof demeanor and centuries-old weariness are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in haunting "what ifs." Their use of the chalk as a temporal lens aligns perfectly with their role and history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the phone's silence triggering a coherent vanishing act. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the chronometer alignment could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—derelict ship and storm-lit clouds merge seamlessly with the chalk's glow. Sensory details (chalk dust, phone dial tone) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Profound impact via layered symbolism (chalk as time, clouds as paths). The ending’s "universe resetting" lingers. Only minor nit: the lover’s flicker could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Brimming with originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors (time as "moth’s wing"), and nuanced emotion. The chalk’s role is ingeniously unconventional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story’s theme of time and regret, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant "what if" ache.</comment>
