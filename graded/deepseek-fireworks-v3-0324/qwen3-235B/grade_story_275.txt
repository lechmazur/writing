<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation and actions are deeply intertwined with their environment, revealing a quiet yet profound defiance against desolation. Their distinct voice and consistent rebellion against barrenness are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s circular structure—beginning and ending with the orchard’s transformation—is elegantly executed. Pacing is deliberate, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the hermit’s personal arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rusted weathervane, algae-scummed water) are masterfully deployed to deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (weathervane, album) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the hermit’s lack of overt emotion slightly dampens emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("comma in a sentence still growing") and nuanced handling of decay-as-prophecy defy cliché. The hermit’s quiet persistence feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic depth. The orchard’s endurance lingers in the reader’s mind.</comment>
