<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear, but her backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her traits, and her 'voice' is distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the timeframe feels briefly jarring.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative. Sensory details are used masterfully, but the "temple in the clouds" could be more concretely grounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "doleful cheer" leans slightly toward artifice. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and creatively integrated. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
