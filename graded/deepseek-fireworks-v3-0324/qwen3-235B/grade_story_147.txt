<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Callum's naivety and motivation are clear, but his "unluckiness" feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, though his distinct voice is muted by the prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, but the resolution's abruptness slightly undermines coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (rusted marionettes, tarnished chimes) amplifying the abandoned caution. Setting and object are seamlessly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of strings, mirrors) and a haunting ending elevate the story. Theme of futile pursuit is layered but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the wind chime mechanism and fragmented mirrors. Some phrases verge on purple ("folded into the dust"), but the voice avoids AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive short story with lingering existential weight. The elements serve the narrative, though the "unlucky" trait feels tacked on.</comment>
