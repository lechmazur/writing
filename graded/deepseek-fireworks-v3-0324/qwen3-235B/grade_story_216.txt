<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "voice" could be more distinct. The scapegoat role is intriguing, but her internal conflict feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The midnight calls and glyphs create urgency, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cloud City's atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (smudged barcode, suspended glass orbs) enhancing the haunting tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (washer as scaffold fragment, glyphs as blueprints) and thematic depth elevate the story. Ending lingers but could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though some phrases (e.g., "obsessive calm") verge on overused. Avoids clich√©s but could push metaphors further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the word limit slightly strains the thematic payoff. Still leaves a haunting impression.</comment>
