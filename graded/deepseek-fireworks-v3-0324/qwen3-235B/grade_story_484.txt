<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brewer's grogginess and stubborn refusal to let his values curdle into cynicism are vividly portrayed. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his 'uniquely generic' attribute feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the staircase's greenish tint as a method feels slightly forced. Pacing is excellent, with no wasted words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard and encroaching darkness are masterfully evoked. Sensory details (frostbitten thistle, struck flint, wet wool) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, ale, fermentation) and flippant solemnity elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the protest subplot feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentically gritty. The brewer's voice and the blending of sacramental and profane imagery feel fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impactâ€”darkness and light as cyclical forces.</comment>
