<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The druid's uncertainty and the weight of obligation are well-portrayed, but their motivation could be slightly clearer. The lunch tin as an anchor is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from the repair shop to the ritual. Pacing is excellent, though the ghost-light task could be more explicitly tied to the debt earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The hologram repair shop and alley auditions create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon glow, shattered-glass voice) are masterfully used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with subtext—beauty as debt, art outliving makers. The ending lingers, and the "cracks where the light begins" line is resonant. Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are deftly employed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of druidic magic and holograms feels fresh, and the "lethargic excitement" tone is uniquely executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
