<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's minimalist nature and quiet rebellion are vividly portrayed, though their backstory feels slightly underexplored. Their motivation to escape is clear but could benefit from more visceral urgency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a strong cause-and-effect chain, though the vault's resolution verges on abrupt. Pacing is excellent for the word count, with a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and precise, with the Study Center's sterile menace contrasting beautifully with the tidal motif. Sensory details (salt, worn cards) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (joker's absence, primes) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. Ending resonates, though the "geological truth" metaphor risks overreach. Conflict is subtle but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors (AI as stagnant pond) and no clich√©s. Voice is distinct, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story, and the length feels deliberate. Lingers like a half-remembered melody.</comment>
