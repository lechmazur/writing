<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caelum's motivation is deeply rooted in regret and creative pursuit, with clear consistency between his actions and traits. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly overshadowed by poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven with logical cause-and-effect, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, with a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly immersive, with sensory details (frost, leaves, fireworks) enhancing the setting's mysticism. The library and waterfall are brilliantly interconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (frost fractals as temporal lenses) and layered themes (regret, transience). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors are fresh (e.g., "temporal lenses"), and the emotional nuance is shown, not told. Style is distinctive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are masterfully integrated, with creative depth. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, contemplative impact.</comment>
