<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira is vividly realized, her motivations (rebellion, search for belonging) clear and resonant. Her "distantly intimate" voice and actions (forging the pendant) reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven; the forge’s discovery and pendant’s creation drive the arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the balloon’s escapade feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital and forge clash brilliantly, amplifying the theme of fractured beauty. Sensory details (hissing pipes, molten metal) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dragonfly, star maps), layered subtext, and a hauntingly purposeful ending. Craft elevates emotional impact and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("wings fractured glass"), nuanced emotion, and a style that avoids cliché. Only minor overuse of "fractured" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, evocative whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache of hope and imperfection.</comment>
