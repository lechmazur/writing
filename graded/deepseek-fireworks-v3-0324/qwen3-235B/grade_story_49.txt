<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and poignant, but "lukewarm" as a descriptor feels underdevelopedâ€”more could be done to show this trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The climax (phantoms dissolving into a new vision) is powerful, though the journal's role is slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lunar base and swirling fog create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The doormat's connection to the setting is masterfully handled.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft. Emotional resonance is strong, and the ending is both satisfying and thematically rich. Only minor tightening needed in metaphor density.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Some phrasing edges toward ornate, but never crosses into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, masterful vignette. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers in the mind after reading.</comment>
