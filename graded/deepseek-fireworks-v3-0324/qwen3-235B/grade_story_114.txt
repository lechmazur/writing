<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's apathy and laziness are well-integrated into their motivation, creating a nuanced contradiction that drives their actions. Their distinct voice and gradual acceptance of their role are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the method of matching frames and the river wisdom guiding the summoner's actions logically. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dream studio and post-apocalyptic setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (metallic rasp, bitter paste) enhancing the atmosphere. The dying god’s aftermath permeates every aspect of the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor (apathetic summoner as a tool, decay cradling life) and symbolism (empty frames, river wisdom) elevates the story. The ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. The lazy apathy as a tool for renewal is fresh, and the prose avoids clichés. The tone and style are consistent and distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with every element serving the narrative. The brevity works in its favor, leaving a haunting, lingering impression.</comment>
