<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Marquess's submissiveness and perceptiveness are well-integrated, revealing depth through his actions and dialogue, though his transformation could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed, with logical cause-and-effect and strong pacing. The eavesdropping device is clever but slightly convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, with sensory details (ozone, damp stone) enhancing the clandestine tension. Setting and object (workshop, letter opener) are meaningfully linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exemplary use of literary devices (symbolism in the hydrangeas, the opener's dents), subtext (aristocratic complicity), and a memorable, satisfying ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("a kinship of the perpetually misunderstood"). Avoids clichés and shows nuanced emotion through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about complicity and hidden strength.</comment>
