<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's cunning and morally ambiguous nature is vividly portrayed, driving her actions coherently. Her motivation—decoding the forgotten—feels sharp and consistent, though her "sudden urge" could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action logically leading to the next. The xerograph machine's reveal and the seeds' transformation are paced well, though the grocery-store segue feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The tower's atmosphere is hauntingly immersive, and sensory details (pollen, rust, bioluminescence) elevate the world. The grocery store contrasts effectively but fades quickly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (ink-stained hands, spectral glow) and subtext about destiny. The ending lingers, though the "sued/savior" dichotomy could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. The xerograph twist and F-sharp orchid are striking. Only minor nitpicks: "gentle chaos" slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for mythic resonance.</comment>
