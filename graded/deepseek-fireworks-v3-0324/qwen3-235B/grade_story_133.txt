<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias' jaded weariness and his mother's gloves add depth; his motivation is clear but slightly rushed in transition to accepting the throne.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tense, though the pottery class ruse feels thin. Pacing is strong for the word limit, but the climax could breathe more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lush, immersive worldbuilding. The orchard and painters create vivid tension, though the harbor’s tidal influence is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (gloves, throne) and subtext. Ending is resonant, though Clemency’s role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and original structure. Only minor stiffness in dialogue (“The hunt isn’t dead”) leans slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the story feels deliberate and layered, not constrained by its length.</comment>
