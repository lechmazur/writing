<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivations are vividly clear and consistent, with his spontaneous caution and roguish nature driving his actions. His distinct voice and the symbolic weight of the apron enrich his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the driftwood carvings and piano serving as logical catalysts. The pacing is brisk yet purposeful, and the resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly truncates the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The coral reef city is rendered with stunning sensory detail, blending decay and neon beauty. The drowning of ambition in the setting mirrors the minstrel’s quest flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (apron as shroud/banner) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates with thematic weight, though the eels' confrontation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in fusing oceanic decay with revolution. Metaphors (neon anemones as dying embers) are fresh, and the tone avoids cliché. Only the eels’ role feels slightly tropish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story masterfully, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with haunting questions about memory and rebellion.</comment>
