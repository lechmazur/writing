<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The character’s blank-faced detachment and the motivation to learn the language of dreams are intriguing but could benefit from deeper exploration of their internal conflict or backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly woven, with a clear arc from the rumor’s arrival to its resolution. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer for impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (mist like shattered glass, waterfalls’ roar) enhancing the eerie, dreamlike mood. The setting is inseparable from the story’s tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism of the ring, metaphors of the moon), the story evokes thought and emotion. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of “translating” could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., liquid mirrors) and no clichés. The “precise madness” tone avoids purple prose, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the ring’s sacrifice could resonate more profoundly.</comment>
