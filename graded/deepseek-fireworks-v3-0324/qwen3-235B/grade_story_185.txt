<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The collector's motivation is vividly clear and their obsessive calm is a compelling anchor. Their actions align perfectly with their traits, revealing depth through subtle gestures like the pencil tapping.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is impressive for its brevity, with the piano's code acting as a elegant through-line. Pacing is tight, though the finale's cosmic scale slightly overwhelms the grounded beginning.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the center feels both sterile and sacred, with the pencil and piano serving as tactile relics. Sensory details (graphite scratches, humming chords) elevate the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the symphony-as-code metaphor resonates, and the ending's "question" of time lingers. Subtext about preservation versus sacrifice is layered and haunting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking originality—no tropes here. The fusion of math and music feels fresh, and the collector's "fractured grace" avoids melodrama. Language is lush but precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm. The elements serve the story's existential heart, and the length feels intentional, leaving the reader with a shimmer of "what comes next."</comment>
