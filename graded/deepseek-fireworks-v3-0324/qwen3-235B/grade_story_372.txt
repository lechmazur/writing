<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's lovelorn state and spy background are compelling, but their motivation could be more sharply defined. The sticky label as a relic of failure is a strong touch, though their actions occasionally feel slightly detached from their emotional core.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains tension, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions. The serum's introduction and resolution are effective, though the scavenger's betrayal could be more integrated into the immediate stakes.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the futuristic slums and holographic graffiti adding depth. The serum vats and sterile vault contrast well with the slums' decay, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (fractured visor, smeared constellations) and symbolism (the label, the serum). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally. Subtext about love and survival is present but not fully mined.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sugar in the rain"). Avoids clich√©s, though "rambling destiny" teeters toward melodrama. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated, but some descriptors feel slightly over-polished.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylish, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. A few tighter character beats would elevate it further.</comment>
