<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's pacifism and rebellion are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation driving his actions. His "valiantly bored" demeanor adds depth, though some nuances of his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the orchard and nails acting as effective anchors. The pacing is strong, but the transition from tradition to rebellion feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The storm-battered orchard and rusted nails create a hauntingly evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the fruit's iron taste and the solstice's chalk maps immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (nails as stars, the orchard as a compass) and a resonant ending elevate the story. Some metaphors verge on overworked, but the emotional impact is undeniable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh twists on tropes (e.g., the "watch" as guidance, not enforcement) and vivid, original imagery. Only minor stiffness in phrasing ("coy malevolence") hints at artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered narrative that transcends its word limit. The elements serve the story masterfully, leaving a lingering question about complicity and freedom.</comment>
