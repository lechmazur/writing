<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Callix's spinelessness is vividly portrayed, with their cowardice and eventual quiet valor clearly driven by Veyra's grandly trivial faith. The key's role in their transformation is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dollhouse key serving as a compelling catalyst. The prophecy’s resolution through indifference is a brilliant twist, though the pacing slightly rushes the final revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The map projection room and glitching dollhouse create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (mildew, gnashing gears) deepen the unease, perfectly aligning with the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (key, dollhouse) and subtext (cowardice as valor). The ending’s rewrite of the prophecy through banality is profoundly thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and audacious in its inversion of tropes (spinelessness as strength). Language is precise, avoiding cliché. Only minor stiffness in Veyra’s dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thematic gem. The elements feel deliberate, and the brevity serves the story’s existential weight. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
