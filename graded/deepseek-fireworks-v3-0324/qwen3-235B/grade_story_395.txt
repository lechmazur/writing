<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calla's shift from dutiful marshal to rebel is compelling and subtly shown through her interactions and choices, though Kael's backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with clear cause-and-effect, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the climax. The harmonic lock and pollen reveal are standout moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—bioluminescent fruit, zero-gravity roses, and humming trees create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as memory, dance as resistance) and evocative prose make the story linger. The ending’s rebellion-through-art theme is powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("gravity wavered like a half-remembered song") and a unique setting defy clichés. Only minor pacing quirks hint at algorithmic stitching.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with the fortune cookie twist and harmonic lock proving ingenious. Leaves a resonant, thematic aftertaste.</comment>
