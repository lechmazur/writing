<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is compelling and consistent, with her childhood fascination and scholarly drive beautifully interwoven. Her distinct 'voice' as a dreamer and code-breaker shines.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence and completeness within the tight word limit. The satellite's signals and scuff marks drive the narrative organically, though the pacing slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite worldbuilding—the cursed lake, submerged palace, and glacial melt are vividly rendered. Sensory details (algae-choked spires, fogged breath) deepen the atmosphere of decay and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (the meteorite as prism, scuff marks as language) and subtext (a machine's grief refracted into compassion). The ending is haunting and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startlingly original, with fresh metaphors ("binary grief," "arithmetic of grace"). No clichés; the scholar's nuanced obsession and the AI's lament feel deeply human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. The elements serve the story’s meditation on legacy, and the brevity amplifies its emotional weight. Lingers like a half-remembered myth.</comment>
