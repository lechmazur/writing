<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear but their "nondescript" nature slightly undermines distinctiveness. Their analytical innovation and cynical innocence are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. The USB drive and ledger reveal feels organic, though the rain's role in untangling memories borders on contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (petrichor, rusted tower) elevating mood. The tower's symbolism as a place of fallen justice is potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (fermented justice, rain as truth-bearer) and layered subtext. Ending resonates, though the seer's hope feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, but "innocent cynicism" tonal balance wavers once or twice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive use of elements. The rain-relic revelation is standout, though the party's hush feels underutilized.</comment>
