<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noble's motivation is compelling but slightly obscured by poetic density; his actions align well with his fractured legacy, though his "voice" remains somewhat distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's brevity is masterfully handled, with the ticket stubs and drone driving a cohesive arc. Pacing feels deliberate, though the combustion-as-language twist risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the lab's volatile heat and mirrored shards amplify the noble's recklessness. Sensory details (soot, warped air) are visceral and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (atonement via fire) and stunning imagery (drone-as-puzzle-solver). The ending’s ambiguity lingers, though the phone-crushing moment verges on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and haunting, but "hollow recklessness" occasionally tilts into overwrought phrasing. The hummingbird drone is a fresh, resonant symbol.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The lab’s collapse feels inevitable, and the story’s brevity enhances its thematic weight.</comment>
