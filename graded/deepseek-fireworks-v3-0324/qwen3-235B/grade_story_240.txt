<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's pragmatic soothsayer role is compelling, but motivation to "become a force of nature" feels slightly abstract. Their actions align well, but the 'why' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the hammer's echo driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is stunningâ€”gnarled forest village and rot-blackened earth create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (charred violets, hammer's resonance) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling is rich with symbolism (hammer as covenant, plowshare as hope). Ending lingers, though the soothsayer's transformation could be more explicitly tied to theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of pragmatism and mysticism. Some phrases ("lavishly humble") flirt with pretension, but the voice is distinct and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The story feels expansive despite brevity, with the hammer's song as a spine. A haunting, cohesive piece.</comment>
