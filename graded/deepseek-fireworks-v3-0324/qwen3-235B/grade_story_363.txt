<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The miner's grief and motivation are deeply intertwined, with his silent bell and daughter's memory driving his actions. His "passionately indifferent" stance is compelling, though slightly inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the miner's quest for the drill blueprint providing clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the parade float's disappearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—tungsten, mica, and meteorite monocle anchor the world. Sensory details (smell, flickering lamps) amplify grief and mechanized despair.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (bell, drill) and subtext (defiance in failsafes) are potent. Ending resonates, though the leader's smile slightly undercuts thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with few clichés, but "poignant levity" wobbles in execution. Metaphors (e.g., "tears a language") are fresh but occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The bell's symbolic weight and daughter's annotations elevate it beyond a mere anti-progress fable.</comment>
