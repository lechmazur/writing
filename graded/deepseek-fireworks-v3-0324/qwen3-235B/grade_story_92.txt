<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Felix's motivation (tuition for his sister) is clear, but his "carefully careless" demeanor feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his role, but deeper introspection would elevate his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the blood drive backstory feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterful—evocative sensory details (hissing lilies, crushed violets) and the haunted mansion setting amplify tension. The botanical nightmare is brilliantly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and literary devices (e.g., "orchids blooming like open wounds"). The ending is satisfying, though the nursery rhyme motif could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases ("fear’s a bad tenant") verge on cliché. The spectral hound and botanical horrors feel fresh, however.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering unease, though the "silent agreement" theme could be deeper.</comment>
