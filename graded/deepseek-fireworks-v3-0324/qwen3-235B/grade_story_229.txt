<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inventor's motivation is clear and poignant, but her "mild curiosity" feels understated given the depth of her commitment. Her reactions to the mystical elements reveal a compelling blend of skepticism and wonder.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with each action driving toward the surreal resolution. The pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the transition from rain-decoding to skeletal sailor feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ship graveyard and erratic rain create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt-crusted planks, weeping pearls) elevate the setting to a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (rose, ring box) and lyrical prose evoke deep melancholy. The ending’s thematic weight—myth over facts—is achieved with rare elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "cosmic intimacy" tone occasionally borders on overwrought. Metaphors (e.g., rain as ciphers) are fresh but risk overloading the text.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The brevity feels intentional, leaving the reader with lingering questions about memory and promises.</comment>
