<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The warlock's motivation is clear and distinct, with his curiosity and disdain for convention driving his actions. His "formally casual" posture adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the warlock's ritual unfolding logically. Pacing is excellent, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with sensory elements (burnt honey, phosphorescent mold) deepening the eerie, decaying setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative prose and layered symbolism (e.g., the fragment's "assessing its host") elevate the story. The ending lingers but could deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The warlock's voice and the artifact’s lore feel fresh, though some phrases verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the word limit feels deliberate. The story leaves a haunting, cosmic-horror-tinged impression.</comment>
