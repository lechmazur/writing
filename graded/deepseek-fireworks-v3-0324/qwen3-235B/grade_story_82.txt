<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant caretaker role and analytical playfulness are vividly rendered; her motivation is clear and her actions consistent, though her emotional depth could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a tight arc with logical cause-and-effect, though some transitions between farmhouse discoveries feel slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—binary-whispering trees and fractal-etched dragon tooth create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dragon heart as truth, orchard as sentient memory) and layered subtext elevate the story. Ending is resonant, though the hub’s AI feels underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingering questions about the dragon’s heart add depth beyond the plot.</comment>
