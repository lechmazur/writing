<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characters are vividly drawn with distinct motivations, though the minstrel's obsession with the cosmos could be more explicitly tied to his actions earlier in the story.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels slightly rushed given the weight of the feud. The connection between cloud-gazing and the stamp's revelation is clever but could be foreshadowed more subtly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and richly detailed, blending futuristic and archaic elements seamlessly. Sensory details (synthetic hay, ozone) elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stamp, clouds) and subtext (inherited grudges vs. cosmic indifference). The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue could feel more natural in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "rubber stamp bleeding into his skin like a question"). Avoids clich√©s and maintains a consistent, evocative style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering sense of fragile hope.</comment>
