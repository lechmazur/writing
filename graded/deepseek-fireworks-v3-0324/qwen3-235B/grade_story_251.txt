<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prophet's ambivalence and "happily sad" demeanor are deeply woven into their actions and decisions, creating a compelling, layered character whose internal conflict drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the marbles' jigsaw puzzle method logically advancing the prophet's goal of scrambling the cosmic scoreboard. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (methane flares, lunar grit) reinforcing the story's tone and the prophet's isolation. Sensory immersion is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (e.g., the marbles as keys, the scoreboard as fate) elevate the prose. The ending is hauntingly ambiguous, leaving room for reflection on rebellion and redemption.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original in its fusion of cosmic mysticism and dystopian labor. The prophet's "bashful arrogance" and the marbles' symbolism avoid clich√©, feeling fresh and intentional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically resonant story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with poetic weight.</comment>
