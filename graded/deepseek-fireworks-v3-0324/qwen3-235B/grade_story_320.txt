<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The diviner's shyness and cosmic burden are subtly woven into their actions, but their motivation could be more explicitly tied to their regret earlier in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight, with the social media posts and vortex climax resolving elegantly. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The underwater market's bioluminescent decay and temporal fractures are rendered with breathtaking sensory precision, elevating the story's melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of layered symbolism (photographs as paradox stitches) and a hauntingly ambiguous ending. Minor deduction for the "hoax" line feeling slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of digital archaeology and metaphysical rupture. Only a faint whiff of "pixelated paradox" leans toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements, with the underwater setting and parallel timelines serving the theme of regret rather than distracting from it.</comment>
