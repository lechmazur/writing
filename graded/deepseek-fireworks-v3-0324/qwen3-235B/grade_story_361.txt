<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly characterized through his actions and skills, though his 'mild-mannered' trait could be more consistently reflected in his dialogue or interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and smog-stained sky create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon, chalk, diesel) enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice as chaos, holograms as preservation) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The dice and schoolhouse are inventive, though the 'hearth' metaphor feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling despite tight constraints. Leaves a lingering question about preservation versus progress.</comment>
