<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher's motivation is clear and their actions align with their undercover mission, but their "suspiciously trusting" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "fateful encounters" concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and strikingly original, with vivid sensory details (paraffin, damp glass) enhancing the labyrinth’s eerie, reflective world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirrors, candle wick) and subtext ("wisdom wearing the mask of folly"). Ending is satisfying, though the "mischievous wisdom" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. Some descriptors ("grotesque caricatures") border on overused, but the core concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. Leaves a lingering question about resurrection and reckoning.</comment>
