<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's repression and secret terror are vividly portrayed, motivating their actions consistently. However, their transformation feels slightly abrupt given the tight word limit.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and effectively driven by the ambush and perfume bottle. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The overgrown street and antique perfume bottle create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (decayed sweetness, shattered glass) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the bottle, the etched verse) and subtext. The ending resonates deeply, leaving a lasting emotional impact.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The prose is lyrical but purposeful, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "singed constellations").</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate and powerful.</comment>
