<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The exorcist's stage fright and familial burden are compellingly woven into their actions, though their "trembling" could be more explicitly linked to their fear earlier.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tight, with logical cause-and-effect, but the transition from toy to ghost confrontation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris and abandoned station create a haunting atmosphere, but the "ghost-wires" could be more integrated into the physical setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wildflower, key) and subtext elevate the story. Ending is resonant, though the "defiant hush" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Only minor gripe: "fractalizing into the voidâ€™s static" borders on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the "never usual" motif slightly overpowers the quieter emotional beats.</comment>
