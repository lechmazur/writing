<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and their actions align well with their academic and arcane duality. Their 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more introspection could deepen their portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect logic. The crossword as a narrative device is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (groaning timbers, salt-crusted windows) amplifying the atmosphere. The haunting tone complements the scholar's quest perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (crossword as map, beacon as bridge) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but could linger more on the scholar's transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "doubly singular" clue feels slightly forced. The prose is evocative without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The lingering theme of rebuilding is resonant.</comment>
