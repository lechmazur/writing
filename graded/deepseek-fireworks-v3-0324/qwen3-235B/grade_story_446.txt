<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gambler's obsession with the ledger and his dual nature (charming by day, quietly furious by night) are compelling, but his motivation to restore the kingdom could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the ledger's mysteries, with a clear arc from obsession to dissolution. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and their luminous decay create a haunting, evocative atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the gambler's quest. Sensory details are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext, the story lingers in the mind. The ending is purposeful, though the "peaceful anger" motif could be sharper in its emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases ("fragile echo of the kingdomâ€™s vanished glory") verge on overused lyricism. The core metaphor of unbecoming feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that uses its constraints to heighten its themes. The brevity amplifies the impact, leaving a resonant afterimage.</comment>
