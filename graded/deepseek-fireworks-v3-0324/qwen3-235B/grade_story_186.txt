<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical nature and obsession with decay are vividly portrayed, but her shift to preservation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the carnival's arrival and the thermometer's rebellion creating a compelling arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is breathtakingly original, with sensory details (gears humming, mineral tears) enhancing the atmosphere of decay and illusion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (thermometer as truth-teller, blood-fed replica) and a hauntingly resonant ending. The theme of impermanence is masterfully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is lush but purposeful, and the twist (replica as preservation) feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on artifice and entropy.</comment>
