<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the hot air balloon festival connection feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and vivid, with cyberpunk and ancient timelines blending seamlessly. Sensory details enhance the atmosphere, though the candle's connection to the data center could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some symbolism (e.g., the candle) feels slightly overworked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The brevity works to its advantage, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
