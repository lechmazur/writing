<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drifter's backstory and motivation are richly woven, revealing depth through her ballet past and lunar struggles. Her 'skittish' nature is subtly contrasted with her decisive action, adding complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the dance-as-repair metaphor driving coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word count, though the resolution's 'spontaneous repair' feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lunar setting is evoked with masterful sensory detail (vacuum silence, sodium lamps). The barbershop's decay mirrors the colony’s fraying systems, deepening atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (shoes, loom) and subtext (grace as courage). Ending resonates, though the technician’s nod slightly undercuts the drifter’s agency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original—ballet-as-loom repair defies tropes. Prose is precise yet poetic, avoiding cliché. Emotional depth is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly. The moon’s silent observation and the drifter’s internal loom linger, suggesting deliberate artistry over constraint.</comment>
