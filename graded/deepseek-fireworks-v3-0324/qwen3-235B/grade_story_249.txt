<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crow’s "lazily ambitious" nature is well-integrated, but their vigilante role feels slightly underdeveloped. The motivation to collect games is unique but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with clear cause-and-effect. The twist with Finch is clever, but the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative. The "forgotten fountains" and rain-pause details create a haunting, whimsical atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering sense of defiance against decay.</comment>
