<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The woodsman’s motivation is deeply interwoven with grief and guilt, making his actions consistent and poignant. The hairbrush as a relic of his late wife adds layers to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot’s nonlinear structure is coherent, with the echo measurement serving as a clever bridge between past and present. Some transitions feel abrupt, but the arc remains satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is a haunting, original setting that amplifies the story’s themes of decay and memory. Sensory details (static, rusted antennae) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hairbrush, echo) and subtext (truth as a blade) elevate the narrative. The ending is resonant, though the hospital monitor subplot could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors, and a distinct voice. Emotion is shown through nuanced actions (the hairbrush’s bristles snagging) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the theme of reckoning. The brevity enhances its impact, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
