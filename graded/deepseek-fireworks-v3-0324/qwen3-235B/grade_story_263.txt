<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Morvain's zealotry and playful malice are vividly rendered, with clear motivation and distinct voice. The plush as a relic of his past adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight, efficient plotting with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing excels in the word limit, though the echo-device resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reef-city is richly atmospheric, with bioluminescent details enhancing mood. Setting and object (plush) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative subtext (morality as a current) and literary craft elevate the story. Ending resonates, though Lysandra's downfall could delve deeper emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "truth festered like unhealed wounds"). Avoids clich√©s, balancing solemnity and dark humor deftly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the plush and echoes serve theme and character. Brief length feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
