<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's elegance and clumsiness, paired with their ghost-seeing ability, create a compelling and distinct character. Their motivation to understand lingering spirits is clear and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The pacing is effective, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sand castle lab and eerie elevator shaft create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the crunch of sand and the "dissonance of silence" immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (flower crown, sand castles) and subtext (grief, preservation vs. release) elevates it. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("like a marionette with one frayed string") and nuanced handling of grief make this feel original. No clich√©s or generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering emotional impact. The brevity feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
