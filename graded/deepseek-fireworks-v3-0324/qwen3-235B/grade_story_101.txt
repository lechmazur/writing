<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivations are clear and her reactions to the bee pin reveal depth, but Herrin's manic clarity feels slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively with strong cause-and-effect, though the parade's role as a detour could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (sawdust, bergamot, metallic hum), though the "bruised dawn" feels slightly overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bee, chair) and subtext; ending is purposeful and resonant. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, though "weathered hearts" borders on clich√©. Metaphors (bee as resilience) are fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse elegantly; brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on grief and adaptation.</comment>
