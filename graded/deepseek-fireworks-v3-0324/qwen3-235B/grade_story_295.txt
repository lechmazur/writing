<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bram's joviality and reluctance are well-balanced, revealing depth as he grapples with his vow. His motivation is clear, though his shift from treasure-hunter to introspective seeker could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the telescope's magical revelation feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the treasure's nature could be hinted at earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden's "elegant mayhem" is vividly rendered, with sensory details (crushed herbs, bleeding ink) enhancing atmosphere. The setting actively mirrors Bram's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (telescope as lens to the past, garden as mirror) elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, though the witch's reappearance feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original subversion of treasure tropes and fresh metaphors (doubt as a bridge). Avoids clich√©s, but Bram's laughter post-revelation edges toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere beautifully, with the time capsule tradition adding thematic weight. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about cycles of doubt.</comment>
