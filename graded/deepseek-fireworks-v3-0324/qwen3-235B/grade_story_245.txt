<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's grief and motivation are vividly portrayed, with the chopstick and tea leaves serving as powerful symbols. However, the "irate" aspect feels underdeveloped compared to the melancholy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven around the smuggler's ritual, with a clear arc from memory to action. Pacing is excellent, though the jogging feels slightly contrived as a framing device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (glass shards, rust) enhancing the mood. The setting mirrors the character's isolation perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (tea leaves as grief, chopstick as imbalance) and subtext. The ending lingers with haunting beauty, though the "heart's revolt" phrasing borders on overdone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh imagery and nuanced emotion. Only minor quibble: "cosmic indifference" edges toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette where every element serves the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving the reader with a resonant ache.</comment>
