<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's somnambulist nature and humble defiance are subtly woven into their actions and motivations, creating a distinct and compelling presence. However, their inner conflict could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and purposeful pacing. The yearly pilgrimage drives the narrative forward logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmospheric details—bottled lightning bugs, petrichor, shifting silver ink—are exceptionally vivid and immersive, elevating the setting to a character in itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered subtext (e.g., ancestral duty, curiosity’s weight) deepen the narrative. The ending lingers, though the emotional crescendo could be sharper.</comment>
