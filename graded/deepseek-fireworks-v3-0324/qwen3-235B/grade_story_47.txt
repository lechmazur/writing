<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ward's motivations and actions are sharply defined, with their jadedness and defiance driving the narrative. However, deeper introspection could elevate their arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and propulsive, with riddles and revelations escalating tension flawlessly. Pacing excels within constraints, though the ossuary reveal could linger for greater impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly immersive, with the sanctuary’s silence and ossuary’s dread woven into every sensory detail. The glove’s tactile presence stands out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (glove, noose) and subversion of ritualistic horror. The ending’s defiance and lingering laugh resonate deeply, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh and unflinching in its take on artistic exploitation. The glove’s whispers and graceless beauty subvert tropes with originality. Minor cliché in "floor gave way."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, razor-sharp parable. Elements serve the story’s nihilistic wit, and the brevity amplifies its punch. Leaves a visceral aftertaste.</comment>
