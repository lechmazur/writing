<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is vivid and consistent, his impulsiveness and caution merging well. His voice is distinct, especially in his delirium.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and driven by the butterfly heist, though the painter’s confession feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (dust, cold steel) amplifying the dystopian tone. The drought center and butterfly are perfectly entwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking symbolism (butterfly as lens, music as drought metric) and a resonant ending. The theme of empathy as transmission is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The prose is vivid without being purple, and the emotional nuance feels human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste. A standout story.</comment>
