<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jester's apathy and academic playfulness are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation rooted in family trauma. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly paced, with the map and garden driving the arc. The ending feels purposeful, though the 3.7-second collapse calculation slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent garden is immersive and thematically resonant, with sensory details (spores, hum, thorns) enhancing the jester's internal struggle. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: rich symbolism (barbed wire, spores), layered subtext, and a haunting ending. The theme of hollowed pain is conveyed with precision and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The jester's nuanced handling of grief and the garden's sentience feel fresh. Only minor quibbles: "intense nonchalance" borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story perfectly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
