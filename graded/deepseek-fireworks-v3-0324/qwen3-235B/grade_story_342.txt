<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calla's carelessness and dreamy resignation are vividly portrayed, with her actions and revelations aligning beautifully with her character. Her voice is distinct, though her motivation to archive shifts somewhat abruptly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the postcards and glove driving the narrative organically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned, though the transition from archiving to emancipation could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The enchanted grove is rendered with haunting specificity, its atmosphere amplifying the story's themes. Sensory details (moss, thunder, frayed glove) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glove as conduit, postcards as prison) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the theme of "trade" could be more subtly reinforced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The grove’s sentience and Calla’s paradoxical exuberance defy cliché. Style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers in the mind like a half-remembered dream.</comment>
