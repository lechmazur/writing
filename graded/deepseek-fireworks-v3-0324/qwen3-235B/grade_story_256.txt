<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is deeply layered—his devotion and quiet defiance feel organic. The measuring spoon adds emotional weight to his longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tight, surreal yet coherent. The café’s fragility mirrors Elias’s hope, and the snapped spoon resets without cheap resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Floating café and grocery store contrast brilliantly. "Frothy despair" and humming typewriters create a haunting, tactile atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful metaphors (time as sugar, blood as commas). The ending’s unresolved foam lingers. Every word serves subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No clichés, only fresh imagery (starlight coffee, time as shrapnel). The despair feels earned, not melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ascends beyond prompts into poetic myth. The spoon’s fracture is both conclusion and cyclical rebirth.</comment>
