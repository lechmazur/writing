<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's reserved yet determined nature is well-portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. Her trembling hands and quiet defiance add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with mending driving the narrative. Cause-and-effect is clear, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. Metaphors (e.g., "fragile as moth wings") are fresh. Nuanced handling of pride and humility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering reflection on art’s endurance.</comment>
