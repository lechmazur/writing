<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's overconfidence and wavering loyalties are clear, but his existential crisis feels somewhat rushed, lacking deeper exploration of his past or true desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and propulsive, with the top's spin driving the narrative, but the resolution leans too heavily on ambiguity without earned payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and evocative prose, though the emotional impact is slightly diluted by the abrupt ending and excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés, but occasional over-reliance on ornate language ("artificially authentic starlight") risks purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the story’s brevity leaves some thematic threads underdeveloped. Lingers, but not at full resonance.</comment>
