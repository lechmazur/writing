<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with stamps and magic is well-integrated, but his shift to chasing a voice feels abrupt. His "ravenously gentle" nature is evocative but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by curiosity, but the transition from stamps to magic lacks clear causality. The ending resolves elegantly, but the middle feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carnival’s decaying, eerie atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (burnt sugar, static) enhancing immersion. The setting amplifies the story’s mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (garnet as voice, fading sign) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The emotional payoff is strong, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "light that shouldn’t have existed"), but occasional florid phrasing ("ravenously gentle") borders on excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that lingers. The elements serve the story, though the stamp-collector premise feels slightly detached from the core magic.</comment>
