<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pip's melancholy and jester background are woven seamlessly into his actions and worldview, though his "iconically unintentional" label could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the tea-leaf prophecy and valve repair creating a satisfying cause-and-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine is vividly rendered, with sensory details (grease, steam, paint fumes) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies Pip's isolation and purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (drawing as blueprint, tea leaves as diagnostics) and subtext (ritual vs. modernity) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("crooked hope," "rusty gear laughter") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©. The jester-engineer hybrid is strikingly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly; the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers with its meditation on brokenness and repair.</comment>
