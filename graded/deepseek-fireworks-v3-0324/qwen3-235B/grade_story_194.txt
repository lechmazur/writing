<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thane's evolution from lumberjack to healer is compelling, though some transitions could be smoother. His motivation is clear but occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the crypt reveal feels rushed. Causality is strong, though the widow's abrupt appearance weakens flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully; the story lingers with thematic weight. Only minor pacing hiccups hold it back.</comment>
