<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending his smuggler past with his current ethically dubious experiments. His "meticulously impulsive" nature is well-explored, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's actions, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center's sterile atmosphere contrasts powerfully with Elias's chaotic experiments. Sensory details (e.g., the brittle butterfly) enhance the mood, though the setting's connection to the painter's heatstroke could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, subtext) are used effectively, and the story prompts reflection on empathy's ethics. However, the emotional impact is muted by Elias's detachment, and the ending lacks full resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (e.g., the butterfly as a "flawed judgment"). Nuanced handling of emotion, though Elias's reasoning occasionally feels overly logical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering question about empathy's cost, though the execution isn't flawless.</comment>
