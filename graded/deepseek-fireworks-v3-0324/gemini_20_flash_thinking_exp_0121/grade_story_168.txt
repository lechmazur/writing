<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and traits are vividly portrayed, with her unconventional methods and intellectual spontaneity driving her actions. However, her "ruthlessness" as a flower arranger feels underutilized in the context of rock art decoding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's unique approach, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt, particularly the shift from floral artistry to archaeology.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stone circle and its atmosphere are richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The lichen-covered stones and the "pause between verses" create a haunting, expectant tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor ("pause between verses") and symbolism (the comb as a key) are effective, but the ending lacks resolution, leaving the central conflict unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Elara's voice is distinct, though her "ruthlessness" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the brevity slightly undermines thematic depth. The lingering question of the rock art's meaning is compelling.</comment>
