<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and compelling, but Elara's adventurous spirit feels slightly underdeveloped. The "professionally wild" attribute is well-integrated but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the flag and paddleboarding feels tenuous. The ending is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, and the ozone station's isolation enhances the mood. Sensory details are strong, though the ocean could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (flag, forge) is effective, and the theme of freedom is layered. The dialogue is sparse but purposeful. The ending resonates, though the paddleboarding detracts slightly from the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but "audacious meekness" feels contrived. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into overly poetic phrasing. Emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though some elements (paddleboarding) feel tangential. The brevity works, but the theme could be sharper.</comment>
