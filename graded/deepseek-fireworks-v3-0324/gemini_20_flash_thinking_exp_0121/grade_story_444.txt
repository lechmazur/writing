<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambassador Valerius is vividly portrayed with a clear, consistent motivation. Her methodical playfulness and fierce resolve are well-integrated into her actions and voice, though her "calm frenzy" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Valerius's indoctrination, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. The ending feels purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is immersive and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (creaking metal, waterlogged parchment) are evocative, though the "radio static" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ghost costume, letters) and subtext. The theme of dismantling illusions is compelling, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Writing style is polished but occasionally verbose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on flowery. Avoids clich√©s but the "calm frenzy" tone occasionally feels forced. Nuanced handling of emotion, but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of harsh truths. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
