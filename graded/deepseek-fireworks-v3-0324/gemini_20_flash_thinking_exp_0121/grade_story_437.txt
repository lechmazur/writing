<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's spinelessness and detachment are clear, but her motivation to understand flowers feels slightly underdeveloped. Her method of influence is unique but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but lacks a strong arc. The connection between Elara's curiosity and her followers' belief system is intriguing but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the rain and ceramic owl enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (the owl, tears) are strong, but the ending feels slightly unresolved. The theme of manufactured emotion is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>
