<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Khenpo Tenzin's stubbornness and motivation are clear, but his internal conflict could be deeper. The shipping label as a relic is effective, but his "dark reflection" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the flute's tooth marks could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (gondola creaks, thin air). The setting enhances the tension, though the monastery's description could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shipping label, flute) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Writing style is polished but occasionally verbose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "dark reflection" trope is borderline. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "harvesting the past") and nuanced emotion elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Leaves a lingering question about redemption vs. vengeance. Elements serve the story well.</comment>
