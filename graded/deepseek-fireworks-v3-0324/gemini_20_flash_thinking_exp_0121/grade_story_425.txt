<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's morose demeanor and motivation to restore ancient systems are clear and consistent, but his sudden shift to excitement feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the blackout, but the resolution feels rushed, and the needle's role could be better foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting and bored excitement tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "lavishly austere" descriptor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (needle, blackout) and a memorable premise, but the ending lacks deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "lavishly austere" phrasing leans toward purple prose. The needle's mundanity contrasts well with the cosmic stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering question but not profound enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
