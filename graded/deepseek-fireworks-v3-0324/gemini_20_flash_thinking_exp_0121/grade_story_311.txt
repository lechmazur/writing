<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character motivation and alignment with traits, though "serendipitously stubborn" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by method, but lunar greenhouse setting feels underutilized for the stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but lacks deeper integration with the conflict; serene anger contrasts well but isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and subtext, though some metaphors verge on generic. Ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on Syndicate tropes. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, but prose occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive, but lunar greenhouse and park visits feel tacked on. Length suits the arc.</comment>
