<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empathy is well-integrated, driving her actions and reactions with consistency. Her motivation to champion outcasts is clear and aligns with her traits, though her "drowsy enthusiasm" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the starfish, marionette, and marshaling outcasts feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective but could delve deeper into cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the contrast between the gritty hideout and the mountain wisdom is striking. Atmosphere enhances both character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, with a memorable ending. The theme of misunderstood outcasts is compelling, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (e.g., starfish as conduit). Nuanced handling of emotion, though the "drowsy enthusiasm" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the marionette's role could feel more organic.</comment>
