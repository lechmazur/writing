<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with a clear, unique motivation that drives his actions. His "regularly random" methodology and emotional depth are compelling, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The connection between the purse and the retreat is logical, though the word limit slightly rushes the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sonic flora and translation center create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (bird calls, faded silk) enhance mood, though the setting's connection to the purse could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (purse, flower) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of emotional language occasionally feels overstated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though some phrases ("improbable longing") verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
