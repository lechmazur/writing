<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with a clear, resonant motivation. His "elegantly clumsy" nature and ghost-seeing ability are well-integrated into his actions and decisions, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's curiosity, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The flower crown's discovery and its symbolic dissection are effective, though the ghost tour subplot feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sand castle lab and elevator shafts are evocative settings that amplify the story's themes. Sensory details (e.g., the "shimmering figures," brittle flower crown) deepen the atmosphere of fleeting beauty and silence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flowers, ghosts) and subtext (liberation through understanding). The ending is purposeful but could linger more. The prose is polished, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "complex simplicity of the crown"). Avoids clich√©s, but minor tonal shifts hint at algorithmic stitching. Emotional resonance is nuanced, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite assigned elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
