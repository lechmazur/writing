<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and consistent, with her cosmic powers and academic wildness shaping her defiance. The brooch serves as a powerful conduit for her ancestral connection, revealing depth in her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the ritual driving the narrative forward. The connection between past and present is clear, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the wind and whispers enhance the mood, though the "ordered disarray" tone could be more consistently woven in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (brooch, abyss) and evokes emotional resonance. The theme of breaking free is layered, though the cosmic powers could be more integrated into the conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cosmic-factory contrast is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Some metaphors (e.g., "trails of stardust") verge on predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of liberation. Minor room for deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
