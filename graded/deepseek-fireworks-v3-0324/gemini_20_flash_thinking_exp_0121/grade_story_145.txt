<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "secret society dropout" backstory feels underexplored. Her actions align well with her goal of restoring empathy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the echo test, though the transition from castle ruins to mansion feels abrupt. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the castle ruins and mansion settings don't fully harmonize. The rosebud's symbolism enhances mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of lost empathy is poignant but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The echo test is inventive but risks feeling gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit strains the integration of all elements. Leaves a lingering question about empathy's restoration.</comment>
