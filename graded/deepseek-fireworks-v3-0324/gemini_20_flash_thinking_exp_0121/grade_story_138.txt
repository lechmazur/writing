<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Auberon's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his forgotten nobility, but his "hollow recklessness" could be more vividly demonstrated through actions beyond the ticket stub ritual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Auberon's fixation on the hummingbird drone and ticket stubs, though the lab setting feels underutilized as a narrative force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's volatile atmosphere contrasts brilliantly with the fragility of the ticket stubs, creating a haunting tension. Sensory details (e.g., "sickly yellow light," "scent of old paper") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the drone as a silent witness, stubs as bulwarks) and a melancholic, reflective tone elevate the story. The ending lingers with quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "hollow recklessness" occasionally veers into abstraction. The hummingbird drone and lab setting feel fresh, avoiding cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant vignette. The elements serve the story’s theme of memory as resistance, though the lab’s potential isn’t fully mined.</comment>
