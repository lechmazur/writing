<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's grumpiness and hidden allure for celestial displays create a nuanced character. His shift from suppressing external forces to confronting internal trauma is compelling and well-motivated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the jiggling of the tube activating the mandala and revealing Silas's trauma. The cause-and-effect logic is clear, and the pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and moonlight-enhanced mandala create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, shimmering patterns) deepen the mood and support the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (mandala, tube) and subtext (trauma as unrest) to evoke emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of trauma feels fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while maintaining stylistic clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than feeling forced. It lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond the explicit plot.</comment>
