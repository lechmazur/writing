<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her telepathy with her weather obsession. Her "efficiently inefficient" nature is well-integrated, though her telepathy feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but glacially paced, mirroring Elara's method. The connection between weather journals and the dock setting is tenuous, though the arc feels complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (ozone, engine grease), but the repair dock feels underused as a setting despite its vividness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (glacier-like mind) and subtext (success redefined). The ending is purposeful, though the conflict is subtle to the point of near-invisibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "noble foolishness" tone is fresh, though the telepathy element risks feeling gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the repair dock and telepathy feel slightly disjointed. Leaves a lingering question about Elara's quest.</comment>
