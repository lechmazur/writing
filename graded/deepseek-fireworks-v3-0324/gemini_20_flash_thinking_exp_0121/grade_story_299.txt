<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending rebellion with reverence. Her "unsure champion" status is well-explored through her art and internal conflict, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in resolving Elara's doubt. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the "cheerful gloom." The chalk cliffs and church bells deepen the atmosphere, though the colony's broader context could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (amber brooch, driftwood) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of imperfect love resonates. Literary craft elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "rationally rebellious" approach feels fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, leaving a lingering impact. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
