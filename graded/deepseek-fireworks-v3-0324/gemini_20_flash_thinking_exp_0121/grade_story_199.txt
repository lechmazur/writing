<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's motivation is clear and compelling, blending duty with personal discovery. His "overzealous" nature is subtly revealed through his obsessive patrols and shifting focus, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the notebook's discovery, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rustling leaves, recycled water canals) enhancing the liminal atmosphere. The timeframe ("after the last human dream") adds haunting depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (goddess echoes, plum blossoms) and subtext (lineage, forgotten magic) elevate the story. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases ("familiarly unknown") verge on repetitive. The handling of emotion is nuanced, avoiding clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the notebook and orchard feeling essential. The brevity works, but the theme of "dreaming" could be sharper.</comment>
