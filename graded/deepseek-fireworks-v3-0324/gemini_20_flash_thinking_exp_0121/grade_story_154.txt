<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finnigan's "strongly weak" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but his frazzled nature feels superficial. The ink pot is well-utilized, but his levitation lacks deeper personal significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. Levitation as a method feels arbitrary. The ending is purposeful but rushed. Pacing suffers from abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The blend of ancient and futuristic elements enhances the atmosphere. However, the "games" timeframe feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ink pot, levitation) but emotional impact is muted. The theme of courage is stated rather than shown. Writing style is polished but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrasing ("jubilant despair"). Some metaphors feel forced. The tone shifts unnaturally. Avoids clich√©s but struggles with nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by them. The brevity works, but the execution lacks finesse. Leaves a lingering thought but not deeply resonant.</comment>
