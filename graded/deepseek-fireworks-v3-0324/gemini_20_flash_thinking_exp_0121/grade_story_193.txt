<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The exiled prince's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his loneliness, but his "unintentionally iconic" attribute feels underdeveloped. His use of the mortar and pestle reveals his longing for connection, but his royal background could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the snowstorm-driven encounter serving as a natural pivot. However, the resolution feels slightly abrupt, and the "unseen forces" concept could be more explicitly woven into the cause-and-effect chain.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lavender, rusty key) enhance the mood, though the "familiar unknown" tone could be more consistently reinforced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mortar and pestle as legacy) and subtext (loneliness vs. hope). The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed. The theme of connection is clear, though the "unseen forces" idea could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its melancholy mood and subtlety, but the "exiled prince" trope leans generic. The mortar and pestle is a fresh symbol, though some phrasing ("howling like a mournful spirit") borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, and the lingering hope is effective. However, the "unseen forces" and "iconic" aspects could be more integral.</comment>
