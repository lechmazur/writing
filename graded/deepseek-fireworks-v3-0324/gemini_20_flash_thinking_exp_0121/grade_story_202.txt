<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn, with his "innocently guilty" demeanor and "code of instinct" driving his unconventional authentication method. His motivation and actions align well, though the poisoner aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is cohesive and purposeful, with clear cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is tight yet deliberate, and the ending resolves the arc satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (skateboard echoes, dusty starlight) enhancing mood. The rapier and setting are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (rapier as mirror to Silas) and subtext. The ending lingers, prompting reflection on authenticity and perception. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>
