<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghostly caretaker's motivation is clear and consistent, blending solemnity with whimsy. His use of the straw reveals his playful yet determined nature, though his spectral voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the caretaker's actions, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the pacing feels abrupt near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frosted ground, shimmering air) enhance the mood, and the setting meaningfully supports the caretaker's task.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes whimsy and quiet longing, with strong imagery (e.g., "perforating the veil of reality"). The ending is purposeful but could linger more. Theme of connection is clear but slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The caretaker's solemn silliness and the straw's mundane magic feel fresh. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, though some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with quiet charm, though it could delve deeper into the consequences hinted at in the logs.</comment>
