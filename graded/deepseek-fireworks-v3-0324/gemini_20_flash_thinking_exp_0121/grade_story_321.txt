<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "distracted" nature feels underdeveloped. His radical desperation is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The hourglass as a method of displacement works, but the transition from silence to redemption could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen is vividly rendered, and the abrasive calm enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the "congealed sin" metaphor feels overworked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich in symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks full emotional payoff. The writing style is evocative, though occasionally verbose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some clichéd phrasing ("cosmic silence," "shimmering dust"). The emotional nuance is present but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
