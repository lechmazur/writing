<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and desperate, but his connection to the twin feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his apocalyptic fear, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the baseball's significance, but the clandestine meeting setup feels rushed. Pacing is tight but functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The contrast between the farmers market and mountain peak is striking, with vivid sensory details. The "crystal shadows" tone enhances the eerie atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baseball as a key) and subtext (identity vs. prophecy). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "crystal shadows"), but some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the twin subplot feels tacked on. The brevity works, though the mountain's role could be more integral.</comment>
