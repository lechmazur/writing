<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's cyber-templar identity and inner turmoil are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to prove safety through light refraction feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kael's action, though the lightning-refraction method strains plausibility. The arc is clear but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rain, bone, chrome) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bridle, prism) and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the ending's thematic punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original cyber-mysticism blend avoids clich√©s. Nuanced emotion ("patiently frantic") and fresh metaphors stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a striking whole, though the prism's role feels contrived. Lingers in the mind despite minor flaws.</comment>
