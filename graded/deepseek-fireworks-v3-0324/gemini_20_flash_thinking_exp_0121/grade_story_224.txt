<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, and the contrast between the giants' chaos and the minstrel's silence is striking. Sensory details are well-used.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the elements sometimes feel imposed rather than organic. The length suits the narrative well.</comment>
