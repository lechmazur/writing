<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and intriguing, blending alchemical precision with romantic obsession. His "unjustly fair" devotion adds depth, though his methods border on unsettling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphor. The morse code device is inventive, though the connection to butterflies feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric sensory details. The "battered marvel" tone enhances the tension between fragility and ambition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and literary devices, though the ending lingers without resolution. The theme of love as a calculated infection is provocative but risks melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Silas's flawed logic and the submarine's dual role as lab and vessel feel fresh. Some phrases verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the word limit strains the thematic weight. The story lingers intellectually, though emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>
