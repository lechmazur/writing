<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His connection to the sea glass and decoding work reveals depth, though his "lone trapper" role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The microfilm decoding drives the narrative, but the "shady archives" premise could be more tightly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is immersive and atmospheric, with evocative sensory details. The "gritty whimsy" tone enhances the world, though the timeframe ("between shifts") feels peripheral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sea glass, black hole) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict could be sharper. The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of loss and doubt is nuanced, but the "silently audible" concept feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with creative element integration. The brevity works, though the "lone trapper" and "floating observatory" pairing could be more organic.</comment>
