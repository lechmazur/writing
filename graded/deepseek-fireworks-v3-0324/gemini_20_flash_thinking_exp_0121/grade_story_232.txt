<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias Thorne's motivation is clear and consistent, but his backstory feels underexplored. His "bleary-eyed" state and scholarly pursuit are well-aligned, but his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to urgency. The coffee grounds revelation drives the action logically, though the temple's menace could be foreshadowed earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (e.g., Turkish coffee, scorching air). The digital nomad camp feels slightly disconnected from the temple's ancient menace, but the tone is cohesive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cutlass as key) and subtext (plague as curse). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper into Elias's dread.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the coffee-grounds oracle and pirate-cutlass twist, but some phrases verge on formulaic ("quiet menace," "cold dread"). Nuance in Elias's unease could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about the curse's origins.</comment>
