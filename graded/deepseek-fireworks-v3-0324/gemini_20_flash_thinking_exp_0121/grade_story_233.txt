<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's naivety and desperation are clear, but her motivation could be more deeply explored. Her actions align with her traits, but her 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method (ritual during commercials) is inventive but slightly underdeveloped in its logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is richly detailed and enhances the story. The "peculiarly virtual" sheen of the statue piece is evocative but could be more integrated into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's imagery and symbolism are strong, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional resonance could be deeper, and the theme of fate feels slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. The writing style is purposeful, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers but could delve further into its central idea.</comment>
