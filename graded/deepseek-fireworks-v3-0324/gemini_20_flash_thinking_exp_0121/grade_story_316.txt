<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's timid yet determined nature is well-developed, and her motivation to heal the community is clear and consistent. Her use of the vintage typewriter ribbon as a tangible link to her promise adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's unconventional method, though the connection between the scoreboard and collective healing could be stronger. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through symbolism (typewriter ribbon, scoreboard) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of collective healing could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and demonstrates originality, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than feeling forced. The brief length works as a deliberate choice, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
