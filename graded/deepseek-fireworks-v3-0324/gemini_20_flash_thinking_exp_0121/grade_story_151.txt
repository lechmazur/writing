<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending intellectual curiosity with a nascent emotional awakening. Her reaction to the veil reveals depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the veil and snowflake driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frost, lace whispers) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (snowflake/veil patterns) and subtext about reason vs. emotion resonate deeply. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict resolution could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The "rationally organic" theme is fresh, but some phrasing ("frozen ground of her soul") borders on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Leaves a lingering question about emotion’s role in progress.</comment>
