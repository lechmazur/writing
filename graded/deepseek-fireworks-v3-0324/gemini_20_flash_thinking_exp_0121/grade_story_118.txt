<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 7's hive-mind nature and therapeutic role are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct collective voice. The use of the phone charger plug as a focal point reveals depth in their method.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the unconventional therapy session, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are richly evoked, with sensory details (candle wax, night air) enhancing the mood. The facility's eccentricity complements the hive-mind's peculiar methods.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the story prompts reflection. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict (pre-mission jitters) is somewhat subdued.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The hive-mind therapist and wax-coding method are fresh, though the "merry bitterness" tone occasionally feels strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering thought. The brevity feels deliberate, and the style supports clarity without sacrificing depth.</comment>
