<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's "cynically hopeful" attribute is well-integrated, shaping his actions and worldview. His motivation to disseminate herbs as a gesture of mercy is clear and consistent, though his backstory (speed dating) feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the speed dating flashback disrupts momentum. The connection between the observatory and orchard is evocative but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory and doomed orchard create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (lavender scent, whistling wind) are vivid, though the "charred serenity" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herbs as hope) and subtext (mercy in brutality). The ending is purposeful, but the speed dating analogy weakens emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the drone pilot/fantasy clash risks gimmickry. Some phrases ("cynically hopeful resolve") verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite forced elements. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about Elias's survival in this world.</comment>
