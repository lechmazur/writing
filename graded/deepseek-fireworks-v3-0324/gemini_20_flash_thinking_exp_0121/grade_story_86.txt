<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Anya's apprehension and exceptional skill with her data-bow are clear, but her motivation could be more deeply explored. The candle's significance is poignant but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the hot air balloon flashback feels abrupt. The resolution is satisfying, though the wraith encounter could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center is vividly rendered, and the candle's contrast with the digital world is striking. Sensory details (ozone, flickering flame) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, borrowed dawn) and subtext. The ending resonates, but the theme of compassion could be more subtly woven into the action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The candle metaphor is fresh, though the "cycles of compassion" phrasing leans slightly toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
