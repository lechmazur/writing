<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zarthus is vividly portrayed with clear, consistent motivation and a distinct voice. His meekness and sincerity contrast refreshingly with typical necromancer tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the dew drop revelation feels slightly abrupt. The broken pen symbolism ties neatly to the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering sense of quiet revelation.</comment>
