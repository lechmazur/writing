<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martha's character is vividly drawn, with her "perfectly flawed" nature and librarian's wit driving her actions. Her motivation is clear and consistent, though her sudden recklessness could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the artifact tag effectively driving the mystery. The resolution is satisfying, though the pacing slightly rushes the antagonist's change of heart.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mystical tone. The setting and object are meaningfully connected, though the "silent watchers" could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (grace, pie) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme of humility vs. ambition is subtly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style is distinctive. Only minor quibbles: the pie metaphor is slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The length feels intentional, and the combination of ideas is inventive. Leaves a lingering reflection on true legacy.</comment>
