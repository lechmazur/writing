<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Esmeralda's motivation is clear and consistent, blending glamour with solemn duty. Her "fruitlessly patient" nature and "jubilant remorse" are well-integrated, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meandering. The paint-mixing ritual drives the narrative, but the social network archive feels underutilized. Pacing is deliberate, though the ending lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—vivid contrasts (silk scarf vs. muted archive) enhance the mood. Sensory details (ochre, umber, brass tape) ground the ritual beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (measuring tape as time) and subtext (myth vs. futility). Emotional resonance is nuanced, but the ending feels unresolved rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "glamorous undertaker" concept is inventive, though "jubilant remorse" occasionally feels overstated. Language is purposeful, not purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. The story's brevity works, but the archive and paint-mixing could be more tightly intertwined. Leaves a lingering melancholy.</comment>
