<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving her actions with a compelling mix of desperation and hope. Her sleep-deprived state adds texture but could be more integrated into her decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The DNA-to-bell method is unconventional but logically fits the cyberpunk setting. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The neon orchard and cyberpunk underworld are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the bell's significance and Elara's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bell as liberation) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant and resonant, with the bell's song serving as a powerful metaphor for emotional release.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The DNA-to-bell method is inventive, though some phrasing ("passionate subtlety") borders on overwrought. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense micro-narrative. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
