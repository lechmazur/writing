<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Armitage's mechanical arm and philosophical duelist background are vividly integrated, but his obsession with the sock feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the lighthouse setting and dream-weaving concept could be more dynamically intertwined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse and eerie atmosphere are masterfully rendered, though the "unexpected applause" feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the tight word limit strains the exploration of shifting equilibria.</comment>
