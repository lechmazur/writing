<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but their "unseen observer" role limits depth. Their actions align with their purpose, but the lack of personal history or distinct voice weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The whale's call and dancer's foot create a clever parallel, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—haunting, vivid, and immersive. Sensory details (salt, moonlight, whale song) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (whistle as conduit, lighthouse as guardian) add depth. The ending is purposeful, though the "undercurrent of wisdom" theme occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The juxtaposition of mundane (plastic whistle) and mystical (whale song) is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery and preservation.</comment>
