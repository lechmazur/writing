<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his "weathered poet" archetype leans slightly familiar. His actions align well with his traits, but deeper nuance could elevate him further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the power outage, but the tight word limit leaves some connective tissue between confessions and sacred flows underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bonsai forest setting is immersive and richly atmospheric, with sensory details that amplify the mood. The darkness and moonlight are used masterfully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the word limit strains thematic depth. The story lingers but doesnâ€™t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
