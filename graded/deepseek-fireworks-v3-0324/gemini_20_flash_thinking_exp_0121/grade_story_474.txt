<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" could be more distinct. The chessboard interaction reveals depth, though his transition from cooking class to grotto feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed in places. The chessboard drives the narrative well, though the grotto's introduction lacks buildup. Pacing suffers slightly from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The celestial grotto and living shadows are vividly rendered, though their connection to the cooking class feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are effective, but the ending feels slightly abrupt. The theme of diversity is layered, though its execution could be subtler. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional resonance is strong, though a few descriptors feel generic. The chessboard metaphor is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the cooking class element feels underutilized. The brevity works, though the grotto's significance could be expanded. Leaves a lingering question.</comment>
