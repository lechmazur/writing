<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Deputy Harding's impassive yet yearning nature is subtly revealed through his actions and the twist tie's significance. His motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Harding's stretch for grace, though the oil change ritual feels slightly underdeveloped as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting is vividly surreal, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (hum, shimmer, pulse) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (twist tie, blossom) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "secret language of bees"). Avoids clich√©s, though the deputy archetype leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
