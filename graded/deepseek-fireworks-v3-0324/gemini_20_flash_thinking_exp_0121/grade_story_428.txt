<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from city planner to doomsday prepper is compelling, but his "rarely authentic" attribute could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear but slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's actions, but the connection between the handshake and the temple feels underdeveloped. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with sensory immersion enhancing the temple's mystique. The ink blotter and setting are meaningfully linked, though the jungle could be more vivid.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes tension. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply. Subtext is present but not fully mined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on flowery. The tone is consistent, though Elias's reasoning lacks subtlety at times. Avoids clich√©s well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers but could leave a stronger thematic imprint.</comment>
