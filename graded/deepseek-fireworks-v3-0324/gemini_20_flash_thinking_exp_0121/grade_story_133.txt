<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with clear motivation and a distinct voice, though his "delightfully menacing" aura could be more consistently demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Silas's task, but the pottery class encounter feels contrived, and the vault/throne thread lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (jasmine, paint thinner) enhancing the intrigue, though the orchard's labyrinthine nature is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (gloves, locks) and subtext, but the ending lacks punch. The theme of subtle power is compelling but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("demure audacity") verge on overwrought. The gloves and hunting methods feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylish, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, but the throne concept could be more integral.</comment>
