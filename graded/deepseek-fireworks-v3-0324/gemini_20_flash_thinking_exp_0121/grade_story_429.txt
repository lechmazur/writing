<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his heritage and personal rebellion. His actions align well with his established traits, though his "earthy farmer" aspect could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between the spice scale and his rebellion is strong, though the northern lights setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe are evocative but not fully exploited. Sensory details (spices, northern lights) are strong, but the platform's potential as a symbolic space is missed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (scale as a key) and subtext (rebellion through baking). The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (celestial ballet) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "hushed euphoria" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering sense of quiet triumph, though the northern lights could be more thematically resonant.</comment>
