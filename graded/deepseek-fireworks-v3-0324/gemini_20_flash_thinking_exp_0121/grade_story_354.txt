<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zephyr's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "self-taught wizard" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his obsession for aurora patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the aurora patterns and the distress call resolution could be tighter. The ricochet action is inventive but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The virtual archive setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "elegant chaos" enhances the story. Sensory details like the "low-resolution gloom" are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's use of symbolism (teddy bear as a focal point) and subtext (digital void as a space for compassion) is strong. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cosmic disclaimers"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "wizard" label feels slightly generic. The prose is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story leaves a lingering impression of wonder, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
