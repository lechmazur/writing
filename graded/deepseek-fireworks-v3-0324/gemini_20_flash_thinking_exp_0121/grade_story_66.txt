<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his quiet deserter nature shaping his introspective actions. His use of shattered masks reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's unconventional method, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, though pacing feels brisk.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile lab and cracked mirror create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hum of equipment, dusty corners) enhance the mood and align with Elias's turmoil.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, masks) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of belonging could be more sharply articulated. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (carbonizing the past) are fresh, and emotions are shown through action. No AI-like flaws detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about belonging. Length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
