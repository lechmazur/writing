<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, blending her baker's craft with rebellion. Her "cynically gentle" nature is well-integrated, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the time machine garage feels underutilized as a setting for the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (cinnamon, dust motes), though the garage's connection to the bakery front could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flowers, moon) and subtext, but the ending lacks a definitive punch. Emotional resonance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blending of baking and rebellion is inventive, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering sense of quiet defiance.</comment>
