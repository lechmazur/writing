<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's quest, though the connection between bootleg recordings and magic could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carnival's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, timeless mood. The faded orchard sign is a standout motif.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "ravenously gentle" and "bold vulnerability" occasionally feel forced. The stamp collector's lens is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative vignette that lingers, though some elements (like bootleg recordings) don't fully justify their weight.</comment>
