<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Julian's cunning and morally ambiguous nature is well-integrated, driving his actions and curiosity. His motivation to decode the forgotten is clear and consistent, though his "sudden urge" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from mundane to mystical. The xerograph method feels slightly forced but serves the theme. The word limit is handled deftly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower and its eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., "fluorescent hum," "brittle paper") immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used skillfully, and the story evokes curiosity. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "decoding the forgotten" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases verge on flowery ("gentle chaos of the universe"). The premise feels fresh, though Julian's moral ambiguity could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. A few clich√©s ("destiny he was determined to seize") slightly weaken impact.</comment>
