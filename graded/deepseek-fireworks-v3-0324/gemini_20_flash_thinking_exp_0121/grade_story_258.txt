<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "physically metaphysical" trait feels underdeveloped and slightly jarring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the map fragment and yearbooks driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "jaded wonder" enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the final leaf, the storm of secrets) and a satisfying ending. Some metaphors verge on overworked, but the emotional resonance is genuine.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The floating orchard and Elias's quest feel unique, though the "physically metaphysical" aspect slightly disrupts authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
