<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coffee-stain oracle driving the climax, though the "fractal sorrow" tone slightly muddles pacing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the storyâ€™s theme of unity vs. obliteration. The brevity feels deliberate.</comment>
