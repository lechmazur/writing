<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flicker's motivation is clear and compelling, with his impulsive nature driving his actions. His "voice" is distinct, though his slyness could be more consistently woven into his decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the cabin diaries' discovery feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the prophecy's specifics remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom village and Whispering Woods are vividly rendered with rich sensory details. The atmosphere perfectly mirrors Flicker's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ticket stub, barn door) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of rebellion could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is fresh but occasionally over-descriptive. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about fate vs. agency.</comment>
