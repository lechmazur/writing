<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, blending detached curiosity with a unique method of intuition. His "analytically innovative" attribute is well-integrated, though his "nondescript" nature could be more vividly portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the action of "untangling" the drive driving the narrative forward logically. The word limit is used effectively, achieving a clear arc and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a haunting atmosphere that complements the theme of delayed justice. Sensory details, especially scent, are masterfully employed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (relic as accountability) and subtext to evoke thought. The ending is satisfying, and the style enhances the narrative's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "streamers drooping like tired smiles") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct, purposeful style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about justice's inevitability, suggesting depth.</comment>
