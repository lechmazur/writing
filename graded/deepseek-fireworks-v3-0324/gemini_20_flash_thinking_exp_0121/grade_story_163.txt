<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "lost heiress" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her bitter optimism and reckless precision.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's detour, but the resolution feels abrupt. The connection between the parking stub and fragmented reality could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenobiology station and cloud migration create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are used effectively to enhance the mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well (e.g., the parking stub), but the ending lacks full emotional payoff. The theme of fractured reality is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though some phrases verge on overly flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The brief length works, but the ending could linger more.</comment>
