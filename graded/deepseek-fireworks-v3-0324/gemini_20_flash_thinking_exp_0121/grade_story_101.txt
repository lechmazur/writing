<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the parade detour serving as a clever metaphor for adaptation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "manic clarity" tone occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing. Avoids clich√©s effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
