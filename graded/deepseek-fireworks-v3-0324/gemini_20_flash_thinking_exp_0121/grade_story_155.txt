<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jax's underwater welding background subtly informs his restlessness and patience, but his motivation to "wield improbable power" feels slightly abstract. His interaction with the button box reveals curiosity and a longing for deeper meaning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric tension rather than clear cause-and-effect. The ending's temporal distortion is intriguing but could feel abrupt without more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The broken planetarium-turned-club is vividly rendered, with neon and bass contrasting the protagonist's introspection. Sensory details (humidity, glinting metal) deepen immersion, though the temporal distortion could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (button box as a key to unraveling) and evocative prose. The ending lingers, though the theme of temporal dislocation could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clichés. The "patiently impatient" trait and vintage mirrors feel fresh, though the timeline crossing edges toward familiar sci-fi tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting vignette. The brevity works, but the story’s depth might demand expansion to fully explore its concepts.</comment>
