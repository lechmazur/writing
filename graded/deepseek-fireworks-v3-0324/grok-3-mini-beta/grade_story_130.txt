<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her self-doubt and journey toward self-acceptance well-articulated. Her "privately open" attribute adds depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from doubt to resolution. The reverse-engineering action drives the narrative effectively, though the phone's role feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and object (bird’s nest) are meaningfully connected, reinforcing the theme of fragility and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism and subtext, with the nest and phone serving as potent metaphors. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The brevity works in its favor, leaving a lingering impression of growth and acceptance.</comment>
