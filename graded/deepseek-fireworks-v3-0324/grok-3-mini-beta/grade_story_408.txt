<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are clear and chillingly consistent, with his "valiant boredom" masking darker intentions. His use of the rusty nail as both tool and symbol is particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's actions, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the escalation of his malevolence. Cause-and-effect logic holds well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard and storms create a haunting atmosphere that amplifies Elias's sinister role. Sensory details (rusted nail, storm sounds) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nail, maps) and subtext (surveillance as control). The ending is purposeful, though the moral conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, with fresh metaphors ("web" of mappings) and nuanced handling of Elias's duality. Avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, eerie whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering unease.</comment>
