<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scribe's internal conflict and transformation are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "certainly uncertain" nature adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the light bulb and envelope serving as effective catalysts. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestones create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (pungent herbs, whispering shadows) enhance the mood and align perfectly with the scribe's arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (light bulb as empathy) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, and the prose avoids clich√© while delivering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with nuanced emotion. The scribe's outburst feels human, not formulaic, and the setting avoids tropes. Minor overuse of "certainly uncertain."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers with thematic depth. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
