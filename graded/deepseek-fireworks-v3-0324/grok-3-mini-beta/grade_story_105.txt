<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her outcast status, but her "strangely trustworthy" attribute could be more explicitly woven into her interactions or the narrative's tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the seashell's revelation and the ritual forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the diaries' discovery feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garage's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending enchantment and isolation. Sensory details (floating lanterns, hum of carpets) elevate the setting, though the restroom tile detail feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell as gateway, midnight as metaphor) and evocative prose create layers of meaning. The ending is resonant, though the "frantic peace" duality could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "mirroring the soul" concept leans slightly generic. The seashell's honesty and Elara's exile feel fresh, avoiding clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the garage and seashell serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on transience.</comment>
