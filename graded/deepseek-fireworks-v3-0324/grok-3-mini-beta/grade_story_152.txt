<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with her frenzied energy and peculiar functionality aligning well with her quest. The love letter as a talisman adds depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Mira's actions, but the tea-leaf method feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the word limit constraints a fuller arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The yawning void and abandoned summer create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (saltwater tears, rusted cup) enrich the mood, though the void's connection to libraries could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are effective, and the theme of cultural bridging resonates. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional impact could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "peculiarly functional" phrasing is fresh, though some descriptors verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with creative use of the juggler motif. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of legacy.</comment>
