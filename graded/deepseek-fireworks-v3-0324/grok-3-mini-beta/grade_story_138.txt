<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Everett's motivation is clear and consistent, with his recklessness and nostalgia effectively driving his actions. His 'voice' is distinct, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the lab setting feels underutilized as a driver of tension. The text messages anchor the structure effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is evocative but inconsistently integrated; the contrast between its danger and Everett's introspection isn't fully realized. Sensory details are strong but sporadic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tickets, drone) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the drone's role as a confessional device borders on contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "hollow recklessness" occasionally veers into melodrama. The drone and ticket stubs are fresh, but some phrasing feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the lab feels tacked on. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about authenticity vs. performance.</comment>
