<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is vivid and consistent, but his backstory (lost love) feels slightly tacked on rather than deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mask's discovery, though the organ chamber's introduction feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and shifting mask create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming resonance, dusty corridors) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (obituaries as manifestos) and a thought-provoking theme, but the "lucid frenzy" tone occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise and fresh metaphors (mask as a "maze of decisions"). Minimal clich√©s, though some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the mask and obituaries elevating each other. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>
