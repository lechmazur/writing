<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his alchemist background feels underutilized. His reactions to the coin and cipher reveal depth, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the chain-reactive coincidences feel contrived. The arc is complete, though the tar pit climax lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The watchtowers and tar pit enhance the atmosphere, but the suburban setting fades too quickly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism and imagery are effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of kinship could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion lacks nuance, and the butterfly trope feels predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the suburban alchemist premise feels underexplored. The brevity works, though some elements need refinement.</comment>
