<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's morbid florist background and cosmic curiosity are well-integrated, but her "boldly timid" nature feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the trunk and candle serving as effective focal points, though the floating dojo's relevance to the climax could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ethereal setting and candlelit atmosphere are vividly rendered, though the "floating rock dojo" risks feeling gimmicky without deeper thematic ties.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, with the candle's extinguishing as a masterful closing metaphor. Minor pacing hiccups in the middle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "petals dropping like fallen stars"), though "neutrally passionate" occasionally feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant vignette that transcends its constraints. The florist-cosmos connection is particularly inspired.</comment>
