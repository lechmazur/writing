<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her "eagerly jaded" nature, but her "dutiful ward" role feels underdeveloped. The glove as a talisman is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the voice notes, but the resolution (saboteur as reflection) feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" and "graceless beauty" tone create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked glove, muted voices) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glove, sanctuary) and subtext (mortality, defiance). Ending is purposeful, though the twist could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into flowery prose. The "reframing" theme is fresh, but some phrases feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the "dutiful ward" and "graceless beauty" feel less integrated. Story lingers emotionally despite minor flaws.</comment>
