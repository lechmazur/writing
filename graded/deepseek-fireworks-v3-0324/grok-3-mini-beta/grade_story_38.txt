<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and poetic nature are well-integrated, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear, though the shift from rage to non-violence could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the subway interlude disrupts momentum. The attic's role as a catalyst is strong, though the pacing wobbles between introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted attic is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The subway contrast works, but the attic's spectral whispers are the standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (botanical metaphors, whispered warnings) are effective, but the emotional resolution feels abrupt. The theme of non-violence is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "empty abundance" tone occasionally veers into abstraction. Elias's voice is distinct, and the prose avoids purple patches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the subway detour slightly dilutes focus. The attic's symbolism is powerful, and the ending lingers, though the word limit strains the thematic weight.</comment>
