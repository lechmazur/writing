<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hiroshi's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past as a lawman shaping his actions. His reaction to the letter reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the letter driving the arc. Some transitions feel abrupt, but the resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The castle and seed-planting timeframe create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (blooming flowers, dust) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spectacles, seeds) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, though some themes are underdeveloped.</comment>
