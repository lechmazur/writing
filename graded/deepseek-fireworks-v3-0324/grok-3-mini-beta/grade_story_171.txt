<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with stamps and magic is vividly portrayed, but his "ravenously gentle" attribute feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's quest, though the bootleg recordings method feels contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bicycle-powered carnival and garnet's glow create a rich, immersive atmosphere, though the faded orchard sign is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism and emotional depth, but the mentor's voice crackling in feels abrupt. Theme of connection is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "ravenously gentle" and some phrases verge on overwrought. Garnet's magic is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though some elements (bootleg recordings) feel less organic. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
