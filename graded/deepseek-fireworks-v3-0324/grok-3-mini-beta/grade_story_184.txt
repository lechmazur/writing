<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, blending resentment and acceptance of her fate. Her unpredictability is well-integrated, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by randomization, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing its eerie gravity. The setting and timeframe synergize brilliantly, amplifying the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seashells, footprints) and subtext, though the ending's thematic punch could be sharper. The style elevates the narrative, but emotional resonance wavers slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sands of time flowed backward"). Nuanced emotion and stylistic flair distinguish it from generic AI output.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, with creative integration of randomization and reversed time. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of artistic defiance.</comment>
