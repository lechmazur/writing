<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and herbalist background are well-integrated, driving her actions and transformation. Her motivation is clear, though slightly more internal conflict could deepen her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the storm's disruption feels slightly convenient. The arc is clear, though the resolution could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bunker setting and storm atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing tension and symbolism. Sensory details (e.g., flickering lights, rain) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clothespin, serum) and emotional resonance, but some metaphors verge on over-explanation. The ending is satisfying but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., clothespin as talisman). Avoids clich√©s, though the "not enough" motif risks repetition. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about Elara's future, suggesting depth beyond the escape.</comment>
