<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance and analytical playfulness are well-integrated, but her transition to "voice of the unknown" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the farmhouse discoveries could be more organically linked to the hub's core.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Futuristic hub and cursed orchard create a striking contrast; sensory details (neon, dew-slicked alloy) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dragon tooth, blight) and layered themes (old vs. new) elevate the story. Ending is bittersweet yet satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of sci-fi and myth, though some phrases ("gleeful sorrow") verge on overused. Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the length feeling deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of revelation.</comment>
