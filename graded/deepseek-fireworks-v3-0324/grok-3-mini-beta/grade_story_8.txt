<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, blending aristocratic rebellion with empirical curiosity. His actions align well with his desire to retool handed-down stories, though his "dazed" state could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between chalked messages and the garden's echoes is effective but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound garden is evocatively rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting supports Elias's rebellion, though the "between lectures" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor ("cosmic dance") enrich the narrative, and the theme of logic vs. madness is compelling. The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though some phrases ("benign ferocity") verge on overused. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers, though the "dazed noble" trait could be more integral.</comment>
