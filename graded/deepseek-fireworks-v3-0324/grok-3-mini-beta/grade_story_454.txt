<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and consistent, blending recklessness with emotional depth. His use of the clover and synchronized alarms reveals his yearning for connection, though his "rationally emotional" trait could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Jax's actions, but the funhouse setting feels underutilized. The ending's isolation is poignant, though the outsider group's test feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is evocative but lacks deeper integration with the interstellar theme. Sensory details are strong but could better serve the dual setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (clover, alarms) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending's bittersweet tone lingers, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in blending sci-fi and gothic elements, but "jubilant despair" feels forced. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the funhouse feels tangential. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection on Jax's sacrifice.</comment>
