<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "convicted dream thief" backstory feels underexplored. Her mathematical flaw and fragmented self are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the leap's execution. The automaton's introduction could be smoother. The arc is complete but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The treehouse library and post-human era are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere amplifies Elara's mania and isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional resonance, but the baseball motif feels underdeveloped. The ending is poignant but the thunder metaphor slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. The fragmented-self theme avoids clich√©, though the automaton's role borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the sport subplot detracts slightly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
