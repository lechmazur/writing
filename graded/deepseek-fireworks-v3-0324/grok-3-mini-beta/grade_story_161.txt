<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His vigilance and sardonic tone create a distinct voice, though his orchardist background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The peacock tail metaphor and conspiracy unraveling are inventive, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility is an intriguing but underdeveloped setting. The peacock motif adds atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seal, peacock) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the sardonic tone occasionally overshadows emotional depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering irony.</comment>
