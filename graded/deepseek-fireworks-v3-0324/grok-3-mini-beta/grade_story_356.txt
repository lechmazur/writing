<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her wry humor and aloofness adding depth. Her actions align with her desire to silence regrets, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the vanishing feels abrupt. The connection between time and Elara's arc is strong, though the resolution could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cargo hold and cosmic setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the theme of time. Sensory details (chalk, dial tone) are effective, but the nebula's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (chalk, phone) and subtext about time are compelling. The ending is poignant but slightly rushed. Literary devices elevate the story, though dialogue is sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The handling of time is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, though some metaphors verge on familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, and the theme lingers. A few tighter integrations (e.g., phone) would elevate it further.</comment>
