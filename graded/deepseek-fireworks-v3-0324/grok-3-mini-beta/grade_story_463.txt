<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit and reckless precision are well-integrated into his actions and dialogue, revealing depth. His motivation to learn traditional methods is clear but could be more explicitly tied to his emotional state.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the confiscation of the rope, but the transition to the ghost's appearance feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the mood. The rope and dance are meaningfully connected to the setting, though the ghost's presence could be more grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (rope, dance) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. The theme of eroding promises is explored but could be deeper. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dance and rope symbolism, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is evocative without being overly ornate, though some phrases border on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but the ghost's role slightly disrupts the flow.</comment>
