<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the future bulletins method feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
