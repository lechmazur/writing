<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her underdog status, but her "drainingly invigorated" state could be more vividly shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her decoding efforts, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The countdown's eternal stasis is intriguing but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and flickering countdown create a haunting atmosphere, though sensory details beyond sight could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (microscope, sun patterns) and a resonant theme, but the emotional impact is occasionally undercut by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans slightly on "oppressive regime" tropes. The "rebellious placidity" tone is fresh but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the countdown's potential feels underexplored. The ending lingers but could be sharper.</comment>
