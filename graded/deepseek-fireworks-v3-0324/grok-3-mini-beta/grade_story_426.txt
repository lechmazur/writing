<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "angrily peaceful" demeanor and secretive nature are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "forgotten prodigy" backstory could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's mission, but the hacking of playlists feels slightly contrived. The arc is clear, though pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's eerie, melancholic tone. Sensory details like "spectral screams" and "flickering lights" are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cracked teapot, ghost train) and emotional resonance, but some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "hacking playlists" element feels less organic. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, leaving a lingering impression. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of preservation is well-executed.</comment>
