<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alex's phobias and stunt double background are well-integrated, but his motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his fears, though the transition from garage sales to pyramid could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed in the pyramid sequence. The garage sale setup and pyramid resolution connect logically, though the pacing stumbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mundanely spiritual atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (dusty tomes, whispers). The pyramid library is evocative, though the garage sale setting fades too quickly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (knots as fears) and a satisfying ending elevate the story. The theme of confronting chaos is clear, though some metaphors verge on overused (e.g., "dancer in the dark").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (fisherman’s net). Avoids clichés, but "numb fascination" occasionally feels stated rather than shown. The voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the garage sales and pyramid feel slightly disjointed. The brevity works, leaving a lingering reflection on fear and unraveling.</comment>
