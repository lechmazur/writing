<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empathy is well-integrated, driving her actions and reactions, though her "drowsy enthusiasm" could be more distinctly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and method-driven, but the marionette's symbolic role feels slightly forced in connecting to the rebellion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout and starfish create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "mountain wisdom" link to space strains believability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance, but the climax (map discovery) lacks tension. Literary devices are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but occasionally overwrought ("drowsy enthusiasm" repetition). Some metaphors feel contrived (starfish as mountain wisdom).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the marionette's role overshadows the journal's potential. Length feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
