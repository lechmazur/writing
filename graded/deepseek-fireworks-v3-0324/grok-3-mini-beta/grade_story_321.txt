<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is vividly clear, and his actions align well with his inner turmoil. His 'almost radical' disregard and confrontation of cosmic silence reveal depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the hourglass and ribbon, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen and cosmic silence create a potent atmosphere. Sensory details (flames, ribbon's glow) are evocative, though the timeframe ("space where an apology waits") feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ribbon, hourglass) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful but could linger more. Theme of forgiveness is clear, though subtext occasionally overpowers clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("abrasive calm") verge on overworked. Nuanced handling of emotion, though a few descriptors feel generic ("dreamlike hourglass").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the infernal kitchen's role could be tighter. Creative combination of cosmic and personal stakes.</comment>
