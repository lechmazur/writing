<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her ghost-seeing ability, but her "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels slightly underutilized in driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the flower crown dissection serving as a powerful metaphor for her emotional unraveling. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's hushed atmosphere and foggy streets create a haunting contrast, amplifying the dissonance of silence. Sensory details are sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flower crown as decayed joy) and a resonant theme of release elevate this beyond surface narrative. The ending is deeply satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the ghost-tour method feels slightly contrived. Nuanced handling of grief avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a poignant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
