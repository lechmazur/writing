<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's late-blooming heroism and motivation to uncover cosmic balance are compelling, but his "softly militant" persistence could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spyglass revelation driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the attic scavenging feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and post-apocalyptic setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (decay, twilight) enhancing the mood. The spyglass and setting are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose, layered symbolism (spyglass as both tool and metaphor), and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of loss and cosmic balance is explored with subtlety and depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases verge on overly ornate ("gravity of loss weigh upon him like an anchor"), but the emotional nuance and fresh metaphors stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
