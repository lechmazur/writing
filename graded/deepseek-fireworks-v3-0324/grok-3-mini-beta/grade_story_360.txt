<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's meekness and sincerity are well-integrated into her character, and her motivation to decode the riddle is clear and consistent. Her transformation feels earned, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to revelation. The dew-drop reflection method is inventive and drives the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dripping stalactites, fungal blooms) enhancing the mystic atmosphere. The setting deeply supports Elowen's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken pen, dew as ink) and layered themes (unity, enlightenment) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying and resonant, with strong "show, don't tell" execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is shown rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers after reading.</comment>
