<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her defiance of genetic limitations driving her actions. Her "sweetly fierce" attribute is well-integrated, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the walkie-talkie method feels slightly contrived. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground fairy city is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi and cosmic undertones, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (fire, fan) and emotional resonance, though some metaphors verge on clich√©. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (defiant underdog, divided society). Language is evocative but occasionally over-ornate. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, though some concepts (cosmic possibility) are underdeveloped.</comment>
