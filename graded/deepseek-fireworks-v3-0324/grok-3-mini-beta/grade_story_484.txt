<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brewer's motivation is clear and consistent, blending irony with a deep-seated desire for transformation. His "uniquely generic" nature is effectively used to contrast with the supernatural elements, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mirror's discovery, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the ritual's execution. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the protest's role is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The graveyard and mansion are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting amplifies the brewer's actions, though the protest's murmurs could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mirror, darkness) and a layered theme of transformation elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, but the flippant tone occasionally undercuts the gravity of the brewer's change.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "flippant solemnity" tone risks inconsistency. The prose avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "twisted embrace") feel slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves its elements, leaving a haunting impression. The brevity works, though the protest's inclusion feels more decorative than essential.</comment>
