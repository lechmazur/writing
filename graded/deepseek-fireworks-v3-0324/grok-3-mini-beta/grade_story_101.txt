<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The landlord's motivation and actions are clear and consistent, with his weathered heart and manic clarity driving his role as a guide. His distinct voice and reactions to the bee pin reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the parade detour effectively driving adaptation. The arc feels complete, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The studio's quiet atmosphere contrasts powerfully with the parade's chaos, enhancing the theme of adaptation. Sensory details (e.g., shadows dancing) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bee pin) and subtext, with a satisfying ending. The theme of reimagined endings is clear, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but occasional phrases verge on overly ornate ("manic clarity sharpening like a blade"). The bee pin metaphor is fresh, but tone shifts slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on adaptation and fear.</comment>
