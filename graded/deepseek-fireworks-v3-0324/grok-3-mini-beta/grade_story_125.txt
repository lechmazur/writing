<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's underachieving nature and motivation to reclaim her heritage are clear and consistent, but her "bored excitement" could be more deeply explored to enhance her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the space station and farmland feels slightly forced. The arc is complete, though the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and flickering lights create a vivid atmosphere, but the farmland boundary feels underutilized. Sensory details are strong but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (doll head as a key) and evokes emotional resonance, but the theme of reclaiming heritage could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but the "exceptionally usual" motif is repetitive. The emotional nuance and fresh metaphors elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of purpose, though the farmland subplot could be tighter.</comment>
