<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anselm's stubbornness is clear and drives his actions, but his motivation to "outsmart his own dark reflection" feels slightly abstract. His reaction to the flute and shipping label reveals depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The flute's tooth marks and the shipping label logically drive the story, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "visually unappealing" mountains and misty atmosphere mirror Anselm's turmoil, but sensory details are sparse. The gondola setting is underutilized for tension or symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flute, tooth marks) and subtext (confronting inner demons). The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "harvesting the past"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "cautious enchantment" tone occasionally feels forced. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the gondola and "heartbeat after a dream" feel underdeveloped. The story lingers thematically but lacks punch in execution.</comment>
