<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Puppeteer's selective mutism and ventriloquism are well-integrated into his character, revealing depth through Echo's unexpected speech. His motivation to archive weather patterns is clear but slightly overshadowed by the family theme.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the pivot from weather archiving to family redefinition feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly rendered with shimmering sand and whispering waves, enhancing the story's ethereal mood. Sensory details are evocative but slightly underused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (coffee sleeve, Echo) and subtext, though the emotional resolution leans slightly toward telling. The theme of found family is poignant but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ventriloquist premise, but some phrasing feels polished yet generic. The parallel universe setting isn't fully exploited for uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the weather-archiving thread feels secondary. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
