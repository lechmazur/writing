<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's rashness as a protector is somewhat underdeveloped, but her motivation for cosmic solace is clear and consistent. Her reaction to the postcards reveals depth, though her "rash" trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit. The chance encounter with the altar drives the story effectively, though the pacing feels slightly rushed near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (howling caverns, wind-swept fortress). The atmosphere enhances the mystical tone and supports Elara's cosmic quest beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story employs strong symbolism (postcards as fragments of the past) and delivers a satisfying thematic resolution. However, the emotional resonance could be deeper, and the conflict is subtle to the point of being understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality in its cosmic introspection, but some phrases verge on overly flowery ("mystical reality"). The handling of emotion leans more on stated feelings than nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the rushed resolution slightly undermines its impact.</comment>
