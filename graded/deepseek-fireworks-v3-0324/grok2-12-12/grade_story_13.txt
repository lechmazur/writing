<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's solemnity and mild fervor are consistent, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract. His actions align with his quest, but deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from box to garden feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the word limit constraints show.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and enhances the mood, but the connection between the laboratory and garden could be tighter. Sensory details are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and theme are strong, but emotional resonance is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the storytelling occasionally leans toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is present but hampered by predictable tropes (e.g., the "key" in the box). Language avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story feels constrained by its length. The garden wisdom theme lingers, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
