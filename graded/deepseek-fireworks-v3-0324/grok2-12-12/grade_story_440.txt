<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's detachment and motivation are clear, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt. His actions align well with his vow, though his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the vow, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center and sea pottery create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but evocative, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (sea pottery, collage) is strong, and the ending is purposeful. However, the theme of detachment vs. connection could be deeper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the swordsman's reasoning lacks human unpredictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the collage's significance could be sharper. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
