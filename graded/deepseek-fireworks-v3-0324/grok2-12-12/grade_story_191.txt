<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear but his "sober cardsharp" trait feels underutilized. The ink well connection is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration of his skills.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed in resolution. The ink well's dream analysis feels abrupt, though the mist-clearing climax works well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Island's misty atmosphere is vividly rendered, but "boisterously quiet" is more distracting than evocative. Coffee motif ties settings effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (ink well, mugs), but emotional resonance is muted. Ending satisfies but lacks lingering depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original premise hampered by clich√©s ("eerie silence," "heart pounding"). Dream analysis feels algorithmic, not nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some (cardsharp trait, "hushed pleas") feel tacked on. Word limit strains thematic exploration.</comment>
