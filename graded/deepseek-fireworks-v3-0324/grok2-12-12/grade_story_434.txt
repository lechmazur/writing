<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ringleader's motivation is clear but his 'commonly individual' attribute feels underdeveloped. His connection to the artifact is compelling, but his loneliness isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The outmaneuvering action drives the story, but the zero-gravity flame ritual feels abrupt and under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest elementâ€”playful dread is well-conveyed through sensory details and the eerie recording booth setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (napkin, artifact), but the theme of ancestral wisdom isn't fully realized. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (mysterious artifact, lone guardian). The zero-gravity flame is unique but feels gimmicky rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by word count. The elements serve the story, but some (like the flame ritual) feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
