<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The aloof inventor's motivation is clear, but his halfhearted commitment feels slightly inconsistent with his raw determination. The wooden spoon adds a personal touch, though its significance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from despair to renewed purpose. The method of translating lullabies is unconventional but fits the story's logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The memory crystal library is vividly rendered, with a gloomy cheerfulness that enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details like the pulsing crystal and echoing steps immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through symbolism (the spoon, lullabies) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though some literary devices feel slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (memory libraries, inventor archetype). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be more distinctive in style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The brief length works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
