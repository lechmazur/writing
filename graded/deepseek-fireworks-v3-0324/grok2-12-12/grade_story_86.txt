<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's apprehension and motivation are clear, but her archer trait feels underutilized beyond the final arrow shot. Her backstory with the stranger adds depth, though the connection to her current mission could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed, especially the hot air balloon memory. The arrow's impact resolves the conflict too neatly for the word limit. Pacing suffers from abrupt transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center and candle create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere. Neon and flickering light enhance mood, but "ancient timeline" feels tacked on without deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle, arrow) is effective, but the theme of compassion cycles is overstated. Emotional resonance is diluted by exposition. Ending is visually striking but thematically heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in combining cyberpunk and archery, but the compassion theme leans clich√©. Some phrases ("borrowed dawn") feel overly poetic without substance. AI-like abruptness in the festival flashback.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the festival encounter feels forced. The candle and arrow work well, but the story's depth is undermined by rushed execution.</comment>
