<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Khepri's motivation is clear but his transition from archer to storyteller feels abrupt. His "hesitantly bold" attribute is somewhat explored but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The connection between the recipe and subtitles is creative but underdeveloped. Pacing suffers due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The palace setting is vividly rendered, but the sudden shift to modern TV subtitles clashes tonally. Sensory details are strong but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of storytelling is compelling but heavy-handed. Symbolism (fading photograph) works well, but the ending feels overly neat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (ancient guard seeking meaning). Some phrases feel formulaic, though the premise has potential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The blend of ancient and modern is intriguing but unevenly executed.</comment>
