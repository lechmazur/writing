<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration. The bride's backstory with the hair clip adds nuance, but the sentinel's actions feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the destruction of the device feels rushed. The connection between the hair clip and the sunrise is inventive but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is vividly rendered, and the contrast with the wedding creates a unique atmosphere. Sensory details are effective, though the restaurant setup feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the theme of "impact of stories" is somewhat heavy-handed. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blending of sci-fi and wedding tropes, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("tapestry of human experience"). The sentinel's "primal sophistication" feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the word limit strains some elements. The hair clip's role is clever, though the lab's artificial sunrise could be more grounded.</comment>
