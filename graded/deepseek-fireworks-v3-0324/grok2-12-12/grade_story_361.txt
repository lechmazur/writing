<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The trapper's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "mild-mannered" trait feels underdeveloped. His mechanical intuition is well-utilized, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The dice and equations drive the action logically, though the transition from diner to schoolhouse feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and schoolhouse are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "organized disorder" tone enhances the atmosphere, though the diner's role diminishes too quickly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (dice as a guardian) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some themes (indigenous knowledge) could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (the lone savior of lost knowledge). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks a truly distinctive style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering thought but could push further in thematic depth.</comment>
