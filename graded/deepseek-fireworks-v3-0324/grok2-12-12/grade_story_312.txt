<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's agoraphobia and motivation are clear, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The snuffbox connection to her grandfather adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on symbolic elements (rain, dunes) to bridge gaps. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and rain create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the mood, though the "between songs" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional payoff could be sharper. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (heirloom as burden, rain as catharsis). Some phrases verge on flowery without fresh insight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The style is deliberate but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
