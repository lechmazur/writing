<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's repression and terror are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His motivation is consistent, though his "knowing naivety" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ambush and perfume bottle use are logical, but the initial "pin drop" moment feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the poet's journey. Sensory details (scent, rustling leaves) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (perfume bottle, cosmic verse) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (feral dogs, repressed artist). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks a fully distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the "pin drop" setup could be tighter.</comment>
