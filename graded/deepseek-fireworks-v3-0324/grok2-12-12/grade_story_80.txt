<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her daring nature shines, but the internal conflict lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between the doorknob and the riddle is logical, though the haunted inns subplot feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like rusted metal and creaking sounds immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue but leans on clich√©s ("truth older than time"). Literary devices are used competently, though the ending's "triumphant clarity" feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality falters with predictable tropes (ancient riddles, hidden artifacts). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though some feel forced (haunted inns). The brevity works, but the theme lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
