<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear but her "aimlessly passionate" nature feels somewhat contradictory to her focused mission. The bent fork serves as a weak symbolic reminder.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the paper airplane and the archer's quest feels forced. Pacing is tight but logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subterranean colosseum is vividly atmospheric, though the amusement park connection is underutilized. Sensory details enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (leaves, fork) is effective but heavy-handed. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext. Theme of compassion is clear but not nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (hidden knowledge, lone archer). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("thick with tension"). Emotional resonance is stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constructed around them. The length suits the arc, but the premise lacks lingering impact.</comment>
