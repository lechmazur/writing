<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but his "scrappy" nature feels underdeveloped. The seashells and footprints reveal his longing, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on whimsy. The portal resolution feels abrupt, though the backward-time element ties the arc together.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vacuum chamber garden is vividly surreal, and the thin air enhances the dreamlike tone. Sensory details (shells clinking) ground the otherworldliness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mending shells), but the theme of "callings" is overstated. The ending satisfies but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original setting, but some phrases ("predictably unpredictable") feel repetitive. Emotional beats are told more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the brevity limits thematic depth. The style suits the whimsical tone.</comment>
