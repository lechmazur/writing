<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The puppeteer's motivation is clear, but his "irritatingly perfect" attribute feels underutilized. His transformation is compelling but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the stamp album and gown, but the transition through the tears feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is vividly rendered, and the gown's surreal tears enhance the mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (stamps, gown) is rich, and the ending is purposeful. However, the "symphonies of truth" concept feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The puppeteer's voice lacks distinctiveness, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity limits thematic depth. The ending lingers, though the concept could be sharper.</comment>
