<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Whisperer's spinelessness and desperation are clear, but his motivation to understand flowers feels underdeveloped. His reliance on the owl figurine is compelling but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by The Whisperer's fading influence, but the resolution feels abrupt. The word limit constraints are noticeable in the rushed ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the scent of blooms and cascading rain enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (the owl, flowers) is strong, and the theme of futile control resonates. However, the emotional impact is muted by the protagonist's passive resignation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (cult leader, dystopian setting). Some phrases ("statically dynamic") feel forced, and the tone wavers between poetic and contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brevity highlights its strengths but also its limitations in depth.</comment>
