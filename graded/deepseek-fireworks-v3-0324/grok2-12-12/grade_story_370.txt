<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The passive conspirator role is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The quantum foam setting is underutilized in driving the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is imaginative but lacks vivid sensory details. The atmosphere supports the theme but could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "buried optimism" is somewhat repetitive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original but leans on familiar tropes (superhero comics, fear vs. hope). Some phrases feel overly poetic without depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit constraints show. The elements serve the story well, though some feel underdeveloped.</comment>
