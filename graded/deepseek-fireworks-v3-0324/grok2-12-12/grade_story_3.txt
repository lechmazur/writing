<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'surly' nature feels underdeveloped. His transformation is compelling but rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between yarn and cosmic patterns feels slightly forced. The riddle resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The graveyard setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details. The 'between seasons' timeframe enhances the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the theme is thought-provoking. The ending is satisfying, though the 'market wisdom' link feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (wise elder, cosmic seeker). The prose avoids clich√©s but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements (market wisdom) feel tacked on. The length suits the story's ambition.</comment>
