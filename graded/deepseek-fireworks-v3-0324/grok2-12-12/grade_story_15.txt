<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "gracious widow" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. Her defiance and hope are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the postcard revelation feels slightly rushed. The forge discovery ties the arc together effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and thick fog create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is strong, and the theme of hope is well-conveyed. The ending is satisfying, though the postcards' symbolism could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise is original, but the "solemnly absurd" tone occasionally feels forced. The writing avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though some elements (like "between meals") feel underutilized. It lingers but doesn't fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
