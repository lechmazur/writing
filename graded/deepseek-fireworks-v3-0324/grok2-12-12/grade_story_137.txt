<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subtle illusionist's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "casually intense" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her use of the binder clip is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in places. The connection between the cashier's hush and the temple is tenuous. Pacing suffers slightly from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple in the clouds is evocatively rendered, but the "hush after a cashier closes out the register" feels disjointed. Sensory details are strong but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of emotional language is compelling. However, the ending lacks punch, and some symbolism (e.g., the binder clip) feels forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but the tone shifts awkwardly between "doleful cheer" and mystical reverence. Some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice. Leaves a lingering but vague impression.</comment>
