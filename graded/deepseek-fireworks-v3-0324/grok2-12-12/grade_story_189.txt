<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "bright-eyed" trait feels underdeveloped. Her literal approach is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The phone booth key drives the action logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like "damp air" and "ghostly whispers" are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the eerie setting. Theme of cosmic unity is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., star maps as water sources). Some phrasing leans generic ("bright-eyed"), but the concept avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the "brazen calm" tone feels inconsistent. The brief length suits the story's focus.</comment>
