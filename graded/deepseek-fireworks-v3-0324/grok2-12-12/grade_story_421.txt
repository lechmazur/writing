<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nomadic dreamer's motivation is clear, but her "ferociously polite" attribute feels somewhat forced in execution. Her actions align with her goal, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The intervention drives the story, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing suffers slightly within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The flower pressing workshop and marinerâ€™s wheel create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere. Sensory details (scent of flowers) are effective, but the timeframe ("hush after a coin toss") feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (wheel as journey) and subtext (harmony vs. clandestine motives) are strong, but the emotional impact is muted. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (clandestine group, nature harmony). Some phrases feel overly formal. Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its length, though the theme is clear.</comment>
