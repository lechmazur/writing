<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The understudy sorcerer's motivation is clear but his "obnoxiously polite" demeanor feels underutilized, lacking deeper exploration of how it shapes his actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between "laundry cycles" and the salt crystal chamber feels tenuous. The eavesdropping method is intriguing but its consequences are underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and oak grove whispers create a vivid, magical atmosphere, though the laundry cycles slightly disrupt immersion. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about cultural erosion, but the ending lacks punch. Literary devices (e.g., whispers as lost voices) are effective but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on "polite sorcerer" and "ancient whispers" tropes. The prose avoids clichés but occasionally feels overly deliberate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the laundry cycles and salt chamber clash tonally. The story’s brevity works, though some themes feel rushed.</comment>
