<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ms. Elara's motivation is clear and her dual existence is intriguing, but her "righteously flawed" nature feels underdeveloped and somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the puzzle tile and the organ's reverberations feels forced, weakening the cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is evocative, and the organ's reverberations enhance atmosphere, but the timeframe ("throughout concerts") lacks specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (puzzle tile, organ) is effective, but emotional impact is diluted by repetitive phrasing ("fierce tenderness"). Ending is hopeful but vague.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrasing feels AI-generated ("righteously flawed," "fierce tenderness"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its length, with some concepts underdeveloped.</comment>
