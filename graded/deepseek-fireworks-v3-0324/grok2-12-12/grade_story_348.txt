<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The somnambulist scout's motivation is clear and consistent, and her sleepwalking as a gift adds depth. However, her humility feels underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between "between flights" and the pilgrimage feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, and the sunken laboratory enhances the mystery. The woodland setting is immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (lightning bugs) and a satisfying ending. The theme of ancestral legacy is clear, though some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "yearly pilgrimage" element feels slightly forced. The prose is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with a lingering sense of purpose. The length feels deliberate, though some elements could be tighter.</comment>
