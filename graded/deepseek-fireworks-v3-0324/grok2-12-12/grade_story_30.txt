<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but telekinetic dice feel underutilized; family tradition adds depth but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; flame ignition and tapestry connection are abrupt. Pacing suffers in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Space pirate setting and sacred disorder are vivid, but dragons as metaphor feels slightly forced. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (dragons, flame) is effective, but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown. Ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original blend of elements, though telekinesis and space pirates clash tonally. Avoids clich√©s but some prose is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but story feels constrained by word limit. Lingering theme of preservation is compelling.</comment>
