<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brewer's detachment is clear, but his motivation feels somewhat generic. The symbolic act of detaching the photo is strong, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the coded lullabies feel underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the portal's appearance is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned circus tent and hauntingly bright light create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, but the "feral elegance" contrast isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (photo as a key) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional resonance is muted, and the theme of escape is somewhat surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by dystopian tropes. The lullaby method is unique but feels contrived. Some phrases ("hauntingly bright") are repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but elements like the circus tent and lullabies feel underutilized. The brevity works, but the ending lacks lingering impact.</comment>
