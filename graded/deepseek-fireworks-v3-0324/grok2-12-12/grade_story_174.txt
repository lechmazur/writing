<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "theoretically creative" attribute feels underdeveloped. His regret and transformation are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between the beginning and end is strong, though the frost pattern method feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hidden library and waterfall setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the sound of the waterfall are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well (pressed leaves, frost). The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors feel slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s but has moments of overly precise descriptors. The emotional resonance is strong, though some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of reflection, though some elements could be tighter.</comment>
