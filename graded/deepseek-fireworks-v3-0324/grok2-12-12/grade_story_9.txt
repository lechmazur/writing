<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "mild panic" feels underdeveloped. Her sarcasm adds voice, but her soothsayer trait is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The puzzle box's connection to environmental stewardship is forced, and the water-ring method feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert and maze of billboards are vividly rendered, but the ozone scent and humming machinery lack deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (puzzle box as environmental crisis) is heavy-handed. The ending resolves too neatly for the story's surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on clich√©s (destiny-shaping relic, "forgotten patrons"). Sarcasm feels contrived, not organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but service the concept more than the story. The length feels restrictive, not deliberate.</comment>
