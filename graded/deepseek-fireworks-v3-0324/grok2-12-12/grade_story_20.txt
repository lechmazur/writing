<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear but his 'anxiously calm' attribute could be more deeply explored. His reaction to the comb reveals depth, though his 'voice' remains somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the roadside attraction detour feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial bodies create a vivid, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the cold comb) enhance immersion, though the setting's connection to the comb could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (comb, waterfall) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resolution leans slightly toward telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrases verge on flowery. The 'bridge of regret' metaphor feels fresh, though the tone occasionally slips into predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the roadside attraction feels like a narrative detour. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the length constraints show in rushed transitions.</comment>
