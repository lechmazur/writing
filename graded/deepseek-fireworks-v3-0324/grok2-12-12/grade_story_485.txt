<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raider's motivation is clear, but her "impulsively thoughtful" nature feels slightly inconsistent with her methodical actions. The charcoal as a symbol works well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent, but the pacing feels rushed in the resolution. The connection between betrayal and sheltering the genius could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater setting is evocative, but the "social upheaval" timeframe isn't fully integrated. Sensory details (echoes, charcoal) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flame, charcoal), but emotional resonance is undercut by abrupt ending. Theme of protection vs. betrayal emerges clearly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original setting, but the raider's "fractured grace" and superstitions feel contrived. Some phrasing leans generic ("haunted by ghosts of their past").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The underwater lab is underutilized as a unique feature.</comment>
