<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "wildly reserved" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her connection to the vinyl is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The vinyl discovery drives momentum, but the folklore method feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nanobotanical garden is vividly rendered, and the vinyl's reflections enhance atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the "last human law" backdrop is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (vinyl as authenticity) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, the folklore method lacks integration, weakening thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on repetitive phrasing ("echoes of authenticity"). Nuance in Elara's fatigue is well-shown, yet some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tight word count, but the folklore method feels forced. The vinyl elevates the story; the garden setting could be sharper.</comment>
