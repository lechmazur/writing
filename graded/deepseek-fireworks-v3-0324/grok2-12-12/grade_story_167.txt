<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "uncommonly typical" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her duty as a scholar, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the wire coil method is inventive. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the well's echo could be better integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The capsule hotel and well are evocative, but sensory details are sparse. The atmosphere supports the mission but lacks deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth, with effective symbolism. The ending is satisfying, though some subtext feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "earthbound flight" tone feels inconsistent. Nuanced emotion, though some phrasing leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering thought, though the capsule hotel feels underutilized.</comment>
