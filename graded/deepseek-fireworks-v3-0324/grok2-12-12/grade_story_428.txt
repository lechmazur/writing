<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's transition from city planner to prepper is intriguing but underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his "rarely authentic" life.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed. The connection between the handshake and the temple is tenuous, though the arc from doubt to resolution is achieved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, but the ink blotter's placement feels contrived. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (temple as redemption site). Some phrases feel overly formal or generic, though the premise is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans heavily on assigned elements. The brevity feels like a constraint, not a strength.</comment>
