<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is poetic but lacks deeper exploration. His shift feels abrupt, though the artist past adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the spider's web method feels underutilized. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered, blending baroque aesthetics with asteroid harshness. Sensory details (camera lens, laughter) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (dawn, lens) and subtext (art vs. violence) are compelling. Ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "cradle the dawn"). Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the asteroid setting feels slightly forced. Story lingers emotionally despite tight length.</comment>
