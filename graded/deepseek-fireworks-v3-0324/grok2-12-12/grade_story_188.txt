<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hiroshi's motivation is clear and consistent, but his backstory as a former lawman feels underexplored. His reflection by the pond is a strong moment of character revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from conflict to resolution. The letter and spectacles serve as effective catalysts, though the transition to renewal feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The castle setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The "corroded rapture" tone is intriguing but could be more consistently woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (koi fish, seeds) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of renewal could be deepened with sharper prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("cycle of violence"). The emotional resonance is genuine but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and thoughtful story, though the elements sometimes feel more assembled than organically fused. Leaves a lingering impression of hope.</comment>
