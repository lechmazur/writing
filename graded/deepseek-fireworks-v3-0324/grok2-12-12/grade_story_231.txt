<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ea's sentimental nature and spontaneity are well-integrated, but his transition from chaos-welcoming to justice-seeking feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the hairpin, but the rebels' sudden cooperation undermines tension. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Sumerian palace setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and Ea's emotional journey. Sensory details are sparse but purposeful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some tropes (reunion, rebels) feel underexplored. Nuanced emotion, though dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a lingering question about justice's cost.</comment>
