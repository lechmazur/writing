<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unlucky" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his cosmic curiosity, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the spar feels slightly contrived. The sextant's role ties the arc together neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground city is vividly rendered with sensory details ("bitter honey scent"), and the setting enhances the cosmic theme. Atmosphere and concept mesh perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sextant, star charts) and subtext about cosmic influence. The ending is satisfying, though the spar's resolution could feel deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "systematically chaotic"). Avoids clich√©s, but the lizard people trope leans slightly generic. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and creatively combined. The brevity works, leaving a lingering curiosity about cosmic botany. Style supports clarity without oversimplifying.</comment>
