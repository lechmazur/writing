<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "angrily peaceful" demeanor feels underdeveloped. The teapot as a conduit is intriguing, but her secretive nature lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the marathon training feels tangential. The ghost train and playlist method are inventive, though the pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, but the marathon training clashes tonally. Sensory details (e.g., cracked teapot, eerie music) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well (teapot, music), but the ending feels abrupt. The theme of preservation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but some tropes linger (haunted park, tragic ghost). The playlist method is fresh, though the "angrily peaceful" trait feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the marathon training detracts from cohesion. The story lingers but lacks full thematic resonance.</comment>
