<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's phobias and motivation are clear, but his stunt double background feels underutilized. His actions align with his fears, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the envelope and net, but the garage sales timeframe feels tacked on. Pacing is solid, though the pyramid's discovery is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library and pyramid create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The mundanely spiritual tone clashes slightly with the setting's grandeur.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (net as fears) is strong, and the ending is satisfying. However, the theme of conquering phobias is somewhat predictable. Literary devices are used well but not exceptionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (ancient library, phobia triumph). Some phrases feel repetitive ("echoes in the dark"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels deliberate in its brevity, though the garage sales and pyramid connection is weak.</comment>
