<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vex's jumpy nature and bizarre necromancy methods are distinct but could be more deeply explored to align with his motivation. His dread and determination are clear, but his reactions sometimes feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to confrontation. The fishhook and mural clues drive the narrative logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The retro video game world and neon-lit streets are vividly rendered, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The mural's contrast and spectral temple deepen the setting's uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (fishhook, mural) and evokes tension, but the emotional impact could be sharper. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, avoiding clich√©s. The fishhook and mural are fresh, though Vex's "jumpy" trait occasionally feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity limits thematic exploration. The style is purposeful, though some descriptions could be more vivid.</comment>
