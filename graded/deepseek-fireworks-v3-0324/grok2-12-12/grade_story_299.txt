<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "rationally rebellious" nature feels underdeveloped; the brooch symbolism is strong but her internal conflict lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the arc is clear but pacing feels sluggish for the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (brooch, bells) is effective, but thematic exploration of "imperfect love" remains surface-level; ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic phrasing ("tangled web of past and future"); emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by them; the length suits the introspective style, though depth is uneven.</comment>
