<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's obsession with stamps subtly shifts to magic, but his motivation remains clear and drives the narrative well. His "ravenously gentle" nature is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The bootleg recordings challenge feels organic, though the garnet's role is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The carnival's whimsical atmosphere is vivid, but the "faded orchard sign" timeframe feels underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., the garnet's glow) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (luggage tag, garnet) and a resonant theme about belief. The ending is satisfying, though the magician's role could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "bold vulnerability" tone wobbles. The stamp collector's pivot to magic feels fresh, though the carnival setting is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite many elements. The word limit feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
