<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt. His "openly private" nature is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the meteorite's role is underdeveloped. The ladle's magic is compelling, but the transition to the meteorite feels forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The giant's dining room and rush hour contrast well, creating a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details, like the ladle's texture, are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ladle, meteorite) and evocative prose, but the theme of transformation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into flowery phrasing. The meteorite's role feels contrived, breaking immersion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the meteorite disrupts momentum. The brevity works, though some ideas need more room to breathe.</comment>
