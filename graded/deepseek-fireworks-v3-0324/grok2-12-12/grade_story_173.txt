<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "trustworthy unique" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her mission, but her personality lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The phantom hand's guidance feels abrupt, but the trade route mapping drives the story effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the "kitchen table wisdom" moment feels forced. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (ancestral guidance, lost knowledge). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, but some elements feel contrived. The length suits the narrative, though the multiverse framing adds little.</comment>
