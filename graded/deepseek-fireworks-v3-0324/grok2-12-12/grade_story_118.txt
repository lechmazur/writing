<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's uniformly peculiar approach is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration of individual agent motivations. The agents' reactions to the candle wax are somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract symbolism. The connection between the scuffed plug and hindsight feels forced in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory details (candle wax, dim lighting). The setting enhances the eerie, anticipatory mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism is overused, but the theme of learning from the past is clear. The ending is purposeful, though the "merry bitterness" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (secret agents, hive-mind). The candle wax method is fresh, but the therapist's voice lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but overly abstract. The elements serve the narrative, though the brevity limits emotional depth.</comment>
