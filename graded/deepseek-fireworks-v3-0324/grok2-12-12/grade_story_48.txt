<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The desert wanderer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "authentically artificial" demeanor feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the connection between the orchard's apple and the space pirate ship feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its conceptual ambition; the length doesn't fully serve its depth.</comment>
