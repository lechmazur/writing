<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jack's transition from gambler to seeker is clear, but his "carefree" nature feels underdeveloped. Lena's introduction is smooth but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically, but the blueprint's connection to the island feels slightly forced. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of resolution and potential.</comment>
