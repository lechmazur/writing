<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's loyalty and motivation are clear, but her "fiercely loyal scout" trait feels underutilized. Her meditation quest is compelling but could be more deeply tied to her scout identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the radicalized comedian subplot feels abrupt. Pacing is solid, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering lights create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (shadows like moths) are effective, but the "sanctified dread" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (journal, moths) and subtext (balance vs. chaos). The ending is purposeful, but the comedian's dialogue leans slightly toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "inside storms"). Avoids clich√©s, though the radicalization angle feels somewhat predictable. Nuanced emotion but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the scout identity and "individually common" attribute feel tacked on. The story lingers thematically but lacks a striking final punch.</comment>
