<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mercenary's spinelessness and eroded courage are well-conveyed, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. Motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the dollhouse's reveal lacks buildup. Cause-and-effect is logical but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The map projection room and dollhouse key are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending leans toward clich√©. Theme of rediscovery is clear but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (prophecy, lost courage). Some phrases feel overly ornate. Emotional resonance is surface-level at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its length. Lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
