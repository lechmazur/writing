<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'poetically rational' attribute could be more deeply explored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the coded stanzas method feels slightly contrived; pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (shadowy manipulator). Some descriptors feel generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story’s brevity limits deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering question about Elysian’s morality.</comment>
