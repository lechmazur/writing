<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn's jovial nature and boldly reluctant attribute are well-integrated, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The telescope and time capsule drive the action logically, though the resolution leans slightly toward convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The witch's herb garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and tone ("elegant mayhem") complement each other beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (telescope, vow) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but the "withering vow" concept feels underdeveloped. Avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors are generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though the theme could linger more.</comment>
