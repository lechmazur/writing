<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "shaky mercenary" trait feels underdeveloped in action. The amber spider effectively symbolizes his entrapment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves resolution, but the transition from rumor chains to altar feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral's atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending decay and artistry. Sensory details (dust, dim light) enhance the mood, though "echoing hour" is slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber, spider) and subtext (self-acceptance) are potent. The ending resonates, but some prose leans toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (haunted past, relic as metaphor). Some phrases ("carefully reckless") feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the timeframe and tone distract slightly. The brevity serves the storyâ€™s introspective core.</comment>
