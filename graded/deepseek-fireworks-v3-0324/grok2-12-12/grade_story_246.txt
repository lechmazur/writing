<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation is clear but his "small-town conspiracy theorist" trait feels underutilized. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the magnetic field anomaly feels underdeveloped as a driver of events. Pacing is effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details, but the magnetic field anomaly's connection to the dresser and letters could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are present, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying, though the ritual's execution lacks deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”some fresh metaphors, but the "generational curses" trope isn't subverted. Prose avoids purple tendencies but leans generic in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its assigned parts. The length suits the premise, though the ending lingers superficially.</comment>
