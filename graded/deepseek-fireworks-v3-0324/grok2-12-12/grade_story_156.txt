<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amara's confusion and diplomatic mission are clear, but her transformation feels somewhat rushed. The spare computer key is a strong symbol, but her shift from confusion to purpose could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The bus ride framing works, but the connection between liberalization and bird patterns feels strained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is vivid and eerie, enhancing the story's mood. However, the subterranean village's unique culture could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key, birds) and thematic depth, but some metaphors ("boldly timid") feel forced. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("joyfully tragic"). Emotional resonance is present but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The theme of understanding vs. imposition is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>
