<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The florist's morbid yet neutrally passionate demeanor is intriguing, but her motivation to understand cosmic cycles feels slightly abstract. Her actions align well with her traits, though deeper introspection could strengthen her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the tight word limit. The connection between the beginning and end is strong, though the pacing could delve deeper into the florist's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and dying lantern create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, and the setting enhances the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle, trunk) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, the emotional resonance could be sharper, and the theme of cosmic cycles occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases verge on overly flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced but could benefit from more subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative well. The brevity works, though a lingering thought could be more pronounced.</comment>
