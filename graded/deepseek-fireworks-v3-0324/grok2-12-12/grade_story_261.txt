<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's borderline immortality and rigidly flexible nature are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels overly abstract. The connection between sketching, spilled ink, and particle accelerators is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and original, but the "particle acceleration garden" feels underutilized. Atmosphere is strong but inconsistent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to balance its many elements. The length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
