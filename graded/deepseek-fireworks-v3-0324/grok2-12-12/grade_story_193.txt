<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His iconic presence is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The snowstorm as a catalyst works, but the resolution leans toward predictability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the mood. Sensory details like the howling wind and dusty rooms immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well (mortar and pestle as a metaphor). The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (exiled prince, loneliness cure). Some phrases feel formulaic, though the premise has potential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, but the theme could be more nuanced.</comment>
