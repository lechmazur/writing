<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'insomniac poet' archetype feels slightly underdeveloped. The connection between his insomnia and poetic struggle could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent, but the transition from attic whispers to after-party confessions feels abrupt. The word limit constraints show in pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with the haunted attic and botanical samples creating a vivid, melancholic mood. Sensory details are strong but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices are effective, particularly the symbolism of decay and growth. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of non-violence could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is present but hampered by some predictable phrasing ("delicate waltz," "empty abundance"). Emotional nuance is strong but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, but some elements (like the subway stops) feel underutilized. The brevity works, but a few more words could deepen impact.</comment>
