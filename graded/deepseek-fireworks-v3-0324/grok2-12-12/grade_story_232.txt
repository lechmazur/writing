<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dr. Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "bleary-eyed" trait feels underutilized. Her actions align with her quest, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The cutlass discovery drives the narrative effectively, though the coffee grounds method feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The digital nomad camp and horizon’s edge setting work well, though the camp's connection to the temple quest is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism and imagery effectively, with a satisfying ending. The theme of unfinished tales is explored, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative well. The length feels deliberate, though some elements could be tighter.</comment>
