<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elio's nervousness and insincerity are well-established, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The star patterns as a method feel underdeveloped, but the journey's progression is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bacteria-powered city is intriguing but underutilized. Sensory details are sparse, though the candle flame and stars add atmospheric touches.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, and symbolism (photograph, stars) is effective. Some telling over showing persists.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original setting but leans on familiar tropes (journey of self-discovery). Language avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic flair. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, though the world-building could be richer. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
