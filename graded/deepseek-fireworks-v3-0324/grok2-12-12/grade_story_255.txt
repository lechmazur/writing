<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "nondescript" nature feels underdeveloped. Her analytical innovation shines, but her distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The USB drive and relic hunt drive the story logically, though the rain's role feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and rain create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., rain scent) enhance immersion, but the party's aftermath is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (relic as justice) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of delayed justice could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases verge on formulaic ("whispering secrets"). Emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the party's hush feels tangential. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
