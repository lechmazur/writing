<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "hopeful knight" archetype feels slightly generic. His cleverly naive attribute is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between the jigsaw edge and the machine’s neutralization is logical but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly rendered, enhancing the ethereal tone. Sensory details like the "haunting melody" immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (e.g., the jigsaw edge). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of redemption could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is strong in concept but falters in execution—some phrases verge on flowery, and the knight trope isn’t fully subverted. Emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the brevity slightly limits thematic depth.</comment>
