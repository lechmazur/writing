<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "factually imaginative" attribute feels underdeveloped. His reactions to the handkerchief and hopscotch board reveal depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The hopscotch board as a method feels slightly contrived, but the connection between beginning and end is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The archive setting and timeframe ("hush as a snowflake melts") work beautifully together, though the hopscotch board slightly disrupts the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (handkerchief, hopscotch) and evokes mournful elation. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but the "seeds of vigilance" concept feels forced. The prose is purposeful, though occasionally overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of purpose, though the hopscotch board detracts slightly.</comment>
