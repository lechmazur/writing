<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "sweetly fierce" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. Her defiance of genetic limitations is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The folding fan's discovery drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underground fairy city is evocative but lacks deeper immersion. Sensory details are sparse, and the "hush of cosmic possibility" feels more decorative than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (fire, fan) well, and the ending is satisfying. However, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by telling rather than showing Elara's triumph.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (failing park, magical artifact). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally drifts into overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but deeper thematic exploration would elevate it further.</comment>
