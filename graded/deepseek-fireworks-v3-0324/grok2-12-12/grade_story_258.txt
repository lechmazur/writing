<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear but his "physically metaphysical" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the connection between the yearbooks and the map feels contrived. The ending resolves neatly but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and enhances the story's mood, though the "storm of secrets" concept isn't fully integrated into the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of preservation is clear. However, the emotional impact is muted by the locksmith's jaded tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows originality, but some phrases ("physically metaphysical grace") feel overly ornate without deeper payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity limits its depth. It feels deliberate but slightly constrained by its own ambition.</comment>
