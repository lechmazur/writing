<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gambler's peaceful anger and obsession are clear, but his "amiable" nature feels underdeveloped. His motivation is consistent but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts ("unbecoming," "hydrolyze") without grounding them fully in action. Pacing is deliberate but risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and vintage ledger create a vivid atmosphere, though the connection between charity drives and the lost kingdom feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (petals, hydrolysis) is ambitious but occasionally overwrought. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of unbecoming could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into abstraction. Some phrases ("peaceful anger," "hydrolyze the barriers") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story struggles to balance esoteric ideas with emotional resonance. The length feels constrained by its ambitions.</comment>
