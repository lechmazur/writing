<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The heretic's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "enthusiastically cautious" nature feels underdeveloped. The teddy bear as a symbol works well, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The stock ticker method is unusual but fits logically. The resolution feels earned, though the battle of intellect could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library and temple setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The "hush" timeframe adds tension, though its connection to the puzzle piece is subtle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teddy bear, stock ticker) and subtext about broken promises. The ending is satisfying, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. The style is polished but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (heretic, omniscient mind). The stock ticker twist is fresh, but the prose occasionally feels algorithmic in its precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. The brevity works, though some themes could be explored further. Leaves a lingering sense of triumph.</comment>
