<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's uncertainty and motivation are clear, but her druidic nature feels underdeveloped. The lunch tin is a strong symbol, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract connections. The hologram repair shop and auditions feel disjointed, though the arc is complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blend of neon city and natural longing is evocative, but "lethargic excitement" clashes with the setting's potential energy. Sensory details are strong but uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (lunch tin, hologram) is effective, but the theme of "beauty from anarchy" is overstated. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable contrasts (tech vs. nature). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("ethereal glow," "weight of obligations"). Nuance is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The brevity feels limiting, not deliberate. The story hints at depth but doesnâ€™t fully deliver.</comment>
