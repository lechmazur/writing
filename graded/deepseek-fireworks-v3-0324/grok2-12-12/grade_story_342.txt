<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is intriguing but somewhat vague; his "careless" nature feels underdeveloped, though the borrowed memories add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surrealism, which risks confusing causality. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal premise, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés but occasionally strains for profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s dreaminess sometimes undermines clarity. Feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
