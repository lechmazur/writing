<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Whisper's motivation is clear but his "energetically lethargic" demeanor feels underdeveloped. His swindler trait is barely utilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the "meet-cute" feels abrupt. The blank price tag as a symbol works well, though the pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the "frozen computer" timeframe is jarringly disconnected from the orchard.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and thematic depth, but dialogue lacks distinct voice. Ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases feel AI-generic ("soothing balm to his weary soul"). Emotional nuance is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story struggles to balance all assigned components naturally. Length feels constrained.</comment>
