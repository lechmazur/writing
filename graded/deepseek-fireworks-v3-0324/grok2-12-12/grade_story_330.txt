<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his "silent vow" lacks depth. His actions align with his despair, but his voice feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The zero-gravity dance hall is intriguing but underutilized as a crucible for transformation. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined, with strong sensory details (lights, clock chimes). The atmosphere enhances the knight's turmoil, though the "sunken realm" connection feels thin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (trident prong, clock) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance. Literary devices are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©s ("reclaim what was lost," "inner turmoil"). Some phrases feel flowery without purpose. The tone is consistent but predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively combined, but the story feels constrained by its length. The zero-gravity concept is creative but not fully explored. Leaves a faint impression.</comment>
