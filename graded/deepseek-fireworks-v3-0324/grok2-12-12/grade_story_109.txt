<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's transformation from a cold-natured knight to an artist is compelling, though his "lawfully rebellious" nature could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the secret agent center and the folk remedies feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the "secret agent center" setting clashes tonally with the folk-art theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits deeper exploration of its themes.</comment>
