<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his "shifty" nature isn't deeply explored. His traditionally spontaneous attribute feels somewhat superficial in driving his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but the surreal circus caravans feel abruptly introduced. The parole denial pivot is effective, but the caravan pursuit lacks setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in setting is vividly rendered and enhances Eli's isolation, though the circus caravans' connection to it is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (microscope, mineralization) and emotional resonance, but the ending's surreal shift slightly undermines thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar redemption tropes. The microscope metaphor is fresh, but the circus caravans verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels slightly constrained by them. The length suits the arc, though the caravan pursuit needs more grounding.</comment>
