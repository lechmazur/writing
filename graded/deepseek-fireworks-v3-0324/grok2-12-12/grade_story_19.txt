<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ranger's motivation is clear but his "feral" nature feels underdeveloped. The balance scale and code words add depth, but his "precisely random" trait lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolism. The connection between the newborn's cry and the dandelions is poetic but slightly forced. Pacing is adequate for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dandelion field and hopeful melancholy tone create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The setting enhances the theme of balance and impermanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scale, dandelions) and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by abstract phrasing. The ending is purposeful but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution feels slightly formulaic. Some phrases ("hopeful melancholy," "chaotic harmony") verge on clich√©. Nuance in emotion is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the story feels constrained by its brevity. The lingering thought is present but not deeply resonant.</comment>
