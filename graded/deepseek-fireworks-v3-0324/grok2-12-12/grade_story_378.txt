<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harold's grumpy yet hopeful demeanor is consistent, and his motivation to change his town's fate is clear. However, his transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Harold's search to his resolution. The beetle's introduction and use are logical, though the ending could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The swamp orchard and monks create a unique atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse. The polluted setting contrasts well with the theme of renewal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. Harold's grumpiness adds nuance, though the monks' "reluctant awe" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The elements mesh well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers on themes of change, though the execution isn't flawless.</comment>
