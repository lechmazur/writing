<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but her "awkward champion" trait feels underdeveloped. The thunderstorm in a bottle and her ambition are compelling, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between baking and philosophy feels strained. Pacing is well-managed, though the fusion of chaos/order could be more logically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, but the "time dilation" aspect isn't fully exploited. Sensory details are strong but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme is thought-provoking. However, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the conflict lacks tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the length feels limiting. It leaves a lingering thought but could benefit from more depth.</comment>
