<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and inner turmoil are well-developed, but her "herbalist" aspect feels underutilized beyond the clothespin experiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on the storm as a contrivance to reveal the hidden chamber. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, though the "secret government bunker" feels marginally relevant to the core conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (clothespin as regeneration) is effective, but the theme of self-acceptance is somewhat overstated in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "inner doubt to growth" arc. Some phrases ("hushed turbulence") verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the bunker and storm feel like imposed scaffolding rather than organic choices.</comment>
