<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lord Elric's motivation is clear and his actions align with his empirically rebellious nature, but his "dazed" quality feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from wandering to purposeful rebellion, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (wind chimes, singing bowls) enhancing the atmosphere, though the "between lectures" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chalk as rebellion) and subtext, but the ending's impact is slightly diluted by abruptness. The theme of logic vs. madness is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on slightly flowery prose. The "cosmic dance" metaphor is fresh, though some phrasing ("benign ferocity") feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the revolution's fate.</comment>
