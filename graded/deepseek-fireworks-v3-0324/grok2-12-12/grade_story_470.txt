<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "practical bard" trait feels underdeveloped. Her "precisely imperfect" nature is well-integrated, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the discovery of the diary feels slightly contrived. The stripped screw as a symbol works, but the transition could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine library is vividly rendered, but the street fairs feel tacked on. Sensory details are strong, enhancing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance is occasionally stated rather than shown. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (hidden diaries, chosen guardians). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though some elements feel forced. The brevity works, but the story could benefit from deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
