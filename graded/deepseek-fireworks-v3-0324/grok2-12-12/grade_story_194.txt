<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "gracefully awkward" attribute feels underutilized in driving deeper character exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the letter's cryptic nature, which risks feeling contrived. Pacing is uneven, with abrupt shifts between themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, but the ossuary-restaurant fusion strains believability. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (healing herbs as metaphor) is effective, but the ending's thematic resolution feels rushed. Subtext is present but not fully mined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but execution leans on tropes (enigmatic mentor, prophetic letter). Some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels overstuffed. The length suits its ambition, though some themes beg deeper exploration.</comment>
