<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "accidentally heroic" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her trembling fingers and racing heart add nuance, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The puzzle box drives the action logically, though the prophecy's reversal feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details ("sharp gentleness of the ocean's whispers"). The seashell and beach enhance the mystical tone, though the hallway timeframe feels disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (puzzle box, sanctuary) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "reversed wishes" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (prophecy, hidden sanctuary). The "sharp gentleness" phrasing is fresh, but some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the hallway/seashell transition is abrupt.</comment>
