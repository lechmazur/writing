<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving her actions consistently. Her "clumsily dexterous" attribute adds nuance, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The pantomime method is inventive but slightly underdeveloped in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the mood effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The pantomime method and "practical illusion" tone stand out as inventive. Minor overuse of descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering impact, though the word limit slightly constrains depth.</comment>
