<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "torn visionary" aspect feels underdeveloped. Theo's introduction adds depth but their bond could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the cellphone's appearance feels abrupt. The resolution is thoughtful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly rendered, but the "careful wildness" tone isn't fully sustained. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of embracing incompleteness is compelling, but the symbolism (cellphone, book) leans slightly contrived. Dialogue is functional but lacks spark.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (anachronistic object, cryptic message). Emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ending lingers but lacks punch.</comment>
