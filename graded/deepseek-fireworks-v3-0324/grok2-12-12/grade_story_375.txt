<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "smiling saboteur" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her goal, but her distinct voice is muted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lira's actions, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though pacing could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details like the flickering flashlight and humming mannequins are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well (e.g., the flashlight as imperfection). The ending is satisfying, but some themes could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though a few phrases border on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression.</comment>
