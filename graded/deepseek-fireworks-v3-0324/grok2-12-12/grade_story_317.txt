<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>N-47's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "anxiously fearless" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. The nostalgia adds depth, but the paradox could be explored more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The sabotage and resolution are logical, though the cave infiltration feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, but the "breaking dawn" timeframe isn't fully utilized. The brass telescope and crystals are well-integrated, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (telescope, crystals) and has a satisfying resolution. The theme of trust vs. betrayal is clear, though subtext could be richer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The android's perspective is original, but some phrasing feels slightly formulaic. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the ending could be more resonant.</comment>
