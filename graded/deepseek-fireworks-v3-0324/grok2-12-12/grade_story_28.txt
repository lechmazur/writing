<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Raven's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "sly agent" trait feels underutilized, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond general determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition; the fork's significance feels abrupt, and the pacing rushes the folklore's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered, but the "oddly usual" fork disrupts immersion. Atmosphere otherwise supports the tone well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (fork, bumper cars) is effective, but the ending lacks punch. Theme of preservation is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "last puzzle piece" trope. Emotional beats are stated rather than shown, and prose occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel functional rather than inspired. Length suits the premise, but the story lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
