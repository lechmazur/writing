<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her traits, but her "meticulously impulsive" nature feels slightly contradictory and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the anesthesia device, which strains believability. The pacing is effective, though the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The drought prediction center is underutilized as a setting. The contrast with the painter's memories is noted but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (butterfly, droughts) is strong, but emotional impact is muted by the detached tone. The ending is purposeful but lacks resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans slightly formulaic. The anesthesia method feels contrived, though the butterfly motif is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some (setting, method) feel forced. The storyâ€™s brevity works, but depth is sacrificed for compactness.</comment>
