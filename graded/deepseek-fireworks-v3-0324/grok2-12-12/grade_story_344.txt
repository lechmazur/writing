<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia and motivation to study human behaviors are clear, but her underwater explorer background feels underutilized and slightly incongruous with the tea house setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, but the connection between Mara's underwater exploration and the tea house feels tenuous. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere effectively supports the story's mood. Sensory details, like the tea's taste, enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has moments of subtext, but the healing touch concept feels underexplored. The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, but some phrases verge on flowery without adding depth. The healing touch and jam recipes feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but some elements (like underwater exploration) don't fully integrate. The length feels deliberate, though.</comment>
