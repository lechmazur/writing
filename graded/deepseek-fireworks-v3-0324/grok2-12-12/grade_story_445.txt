<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear but his "sleepy" attribute feels underutilized. His realization about humility is well-executed but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the transition from masquerade to hiking trail feels abrupt. Pacing is decent, though the word limit strains the arc's fullness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eldoria's blending of tangible and ethereal is evocative, but the disguise room's connection to the broader world feels tenuous. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (broken barbells) is effective, but the theme of humility vs. arrogance is somewhat heavy-handed. Ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middling—the "downfall of arrogance" trope isn't subverted. Prose avoids clichés but lacks stylistic distinctiveness. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the disguise room and hiking trail clash tonally. The story feels constrained by its length, not enhanced by it.</comment>
