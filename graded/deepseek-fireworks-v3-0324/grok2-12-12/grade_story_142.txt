<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Julian's motivation is clear but his aristocratic background feels underutilized; his connection to the illustrations is compelling but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels slightly rushed; the roller coaster's "coming alive" is atmospheric but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered, but "blurry vividness" as a tone is inconsistently applied; sensory details are strong but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and atmosphere, but the emotional payoff is somewhat muted; the theme of legacy is clear but lacks deeper layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes; some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity. The botanical illustrations are a fresh touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the ending lacks lingering impact; the elements serve the narrative well but don't transcend it.</comment>
