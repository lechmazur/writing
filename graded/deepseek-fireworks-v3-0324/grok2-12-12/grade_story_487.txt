<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theo's docile bruiser persona and disturbingly calm demeanor are intriguing but lack deeper exploration. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the shredded map feels underutilized. The baton's resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth and drum solos create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the man-eating plants could be more menacing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (baton as myth-maker) but lacks deeper subtext. The ending is purposeful but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”the baton and labyrinth are fresh, but Theo's arc feels familiar. Some phrasing leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story doesn't fully transcend its constraints. A lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
