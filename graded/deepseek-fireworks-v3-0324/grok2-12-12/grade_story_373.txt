<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dr. Flux's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his cybernetic nature and veterinary background feel underutilized in shaping his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over tangible progression; the ending lacks resolution despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, but "kaleidoscopic coral" feels decorative rather than integral to the story's logic or tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and subtext, but the central conflict (life vs. death) is stated more than explored through action or consequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing (e.g., "unholy experiments"). The tone avoids clich√© but wavers in consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some (like the coral) feel imposed. The brevity works, though the story leans more on mood than narrative depth.</comment>
