<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ionizing action drives the story forward logically, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and uses literary devices well (e.g., the sentient plants as symbolism). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of loyalty vs. discovery could be deeper.</comment>
