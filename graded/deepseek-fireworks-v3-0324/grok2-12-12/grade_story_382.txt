<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "unruffled" trait feels underdeveloped. The rose petals add depth, but his "oddly certain" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The dream dictionary as a method feels contrived, though the arc is complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with the library and café conversations enhancing the mood. Sensory details (coffee, petals) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (red streak, petals) and subtext, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with "gleeful sorrow."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but some phrases ("gleam in the ruins") verge on cliché. Emotional nuance is present but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the dream dictionary feels forced. The length suits the introspective style, leaving a lingering impression.</comment>
