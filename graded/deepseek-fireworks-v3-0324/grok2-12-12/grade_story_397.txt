<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bartender's motivation is clear but his transformation feels abrupt. His jaded nature is established but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the resolution is rushed. The doodles-as-map device is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's strange atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the fireworks timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scalpel, crystals), but the emotional payoff lacks nuance. The ending is hopeful but generic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise, but some tropes linger (regretful protagonist). The "optimistic desperation" tone wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lab setting elevates an otherwise familiar arc.</comment>
