<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jack's motivation is clear but his skepticism as a gambler feels underutilized. The grief element is poignant but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the cryptic scrawls feel contrived. Pacing is tight, though the resolution with authorities is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underground mushroom farm is vividly rendered, but the "frantic peace" tone clashes slightly with the setting's inherent tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (petals, scrawls) is effective, but the emotional payoff lacks subtlety. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”some tropes (grieving guide, hidden messages) feel familiar. Language avoids purple prose but lacks daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the gambler trait and "truthfully lying" feel tacked on. The length suits the story's scope.</comment>
