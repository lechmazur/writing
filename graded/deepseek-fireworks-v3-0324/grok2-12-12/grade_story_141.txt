<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's superstitious nature and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "strange" attribute is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the scavenger hunt feels contrived. The cave exploration and spiritual awakening are compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater cave setting is vividly atmospheric, with thunder and lightning enhancing the dread. Sensory details are strong but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and theme are well-executed, but the dialogue lacks nuance. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases feel formulaic. The "women's wisdom" theme risks clich√© without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the scavenger hunt weakens momentum. The length feels deliberate, though some elements are underdeveloped.</comment>
