<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marco's apologetic nature and motivation are clear, but his "rationally subjective" approach feels underdeveloped. His growth is shown, but the thug-to-redemption arc lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on predictable beats (e.g., staged meetings, therapist intervention). Pacing is efficient, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative and symbolic, but its connection to Marco's transformation could be sharper. Atmosphere supports mood well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (garden, silhouette) is effective, but themes of resilience and redemption are stated rather than deeply explored. Ending is satisfying but conventional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (redemptive thug, wise therapist). Some fresh details (static garden), but emotional beats lack subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constructed to fit prompts rather than organically layered. Length is managed, but depth is sacrificed.</comment>
