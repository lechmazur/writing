<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scarecrow's fervent apathy is intriguing but could be more deeply explored. Its motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the virtual reality shift feels abrupt. The climax resolves cleanly, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The fossilized giant and parallel worlds mesh beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and thematic depth, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the scarecrow's voice could feel more distinct. Fresh metaphors elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the virtual reality element slightly disrupts the flow. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
