<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eron's indifference is subtly portrayed but his motivation to seek peace through a covenant is compelling. The ribbon ties his past to his present, revealing depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the covenant's resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacombs' atmosphere is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mystic tone. Sensory details (glowing stones, echoing haw) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ribbon, rubble) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the covenant's mechanics could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of mysticism and craftsmanship, but some phrases ("rise from the rubble") edge toward clich√©. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of renewal, though the covenant's nature could be sharper.</comment>
