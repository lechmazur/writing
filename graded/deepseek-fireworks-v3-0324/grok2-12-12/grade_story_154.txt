<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eamon's frazzled state and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "voice" is distinct but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans on convenience (e.g., elder’s immediate understanding). Pacing is tight, though the resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Celtic village and ink pot are evocatively linked, but "between games" timeframe feels underutilized. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink pot) works well, but emotional impact is muted. Theme of resilience is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ink pot’s paradox, but "jubilant despair" tone clashes at times. Avoids clichés, though some phrasing is overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
