<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's apathy and lazy enthusiasm are distinct but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped. The coffee grinder interaction reveals depth, but her arc lacks full nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The river's wisdom and frames could be more tightly integrated, but the ritual's climax is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dreamlike setting and sensory details (grinding beans, glowing frames) are evocative. The coffee grinder's incongruity works, but the studio's purpose is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (grinder as conduit) and a resonant ending. The theme of apathy vs. purpose is clear, though some metaphors feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "enthusiastically lazy" tone is unique, though the river's wisdom could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of renewal.</comment>
