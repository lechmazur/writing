<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness and odd behavior are well-established, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The motivation to "pierce illusions" is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the pacing is brisk. The logbook's discovery and reconstruction drive the narrative effectively, but the sailor's introduction feels convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port city and labyrinth of containers are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmosphere. The "wounded season" adds a poetic layer, though its connection to the plot is subtle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance and thematic depth are strong, with effective use of symbolism (logbook as empowerment). The ending is satisfying, though some literary devices verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality is evident in the diver's logbook concept, but some phrasing feels formulaic ("predictably odd"). The tone avoids purple prose but occasionally leans into predictable nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. It leaves a lingering impression, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
