<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's sincerity and conjurer role are well-integrated, but her "dysfunctionally functional" grace feels slightly forced. Motivation is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the shared dream device leans on convenience. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but "between waves" as a timeframe is underutilized. Sensory details elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (calendar, yarn) and emotional resonance, but the theme of cynicism could be more nuanced. Ending is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dream bridge concept, but "dysfunctionally functional" and "determined wandering" verge on clich√©. Style is fresh but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the sanctuary feels slightly contrived. Leaves a lingering hope, but depth is surface-level.</comment>
