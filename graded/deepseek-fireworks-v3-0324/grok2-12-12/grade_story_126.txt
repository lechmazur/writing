<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The merchant's motivation is clear but his "honestly strange" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the butter churn's role feels contrived. Pacing is tight, though the passage reveal is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The space station and post-apocalyptic tone are evocative, but the butter churn's placement strains believability. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (illusion, churn) is strong, but emotional resonance is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the absurdity of the churn, but "rebellious sparks" and "aloof passion" verge on clich√©. Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The churn's role lingers oddly.</comment>
