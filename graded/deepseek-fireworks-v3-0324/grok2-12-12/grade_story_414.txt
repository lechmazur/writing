<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but Finn's "pleasantly troublesome" nature feels underdeveloped. Their connection is hinted at but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed. The intruders' arrival feels abrupt, and the resolution is too tidy for the stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length, sacrificing nuance for brevity.</comment>
