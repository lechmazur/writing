<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between mapping caves and necromancy is tenuous, leaving the story's arc feeling slightly disjointed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the necromancer element detracts from its emotional core rather than enhancing it.</comment>
