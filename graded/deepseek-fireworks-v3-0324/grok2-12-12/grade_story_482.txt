<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The insomniac painter's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. The bullet hole in his hat adds depth but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the beginning and end feels slightly forced within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop and giant mushrooms create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the timeframe ("hush of an empty classroom") feels slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by the abrupt ending. The theme of "painted smiles" is compelling but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("frolicsome regret") verge on overly flowery. The story avoids clichés but occasionally feels self-consciously poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic depth. The story lingers but doesn’t fully resonate.</comment>
