<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "forthright peddler" trait feels underutilized. Her meek assertiveness is well-integrated, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the gossip columns feel tangential. The oath-breaking resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned medical bay is evocative but underdeveloped. The "universe's secret song" is poetic but lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolism, though some devices (e.g., the song) verge on clich√©. The ending is impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (blood oaths, redemption arcs). The flowers are a fresh touch, but the loneliness tone feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite cramming many elements. The length feels deliberate, but some elements (gossip columns) detract.</comment>
