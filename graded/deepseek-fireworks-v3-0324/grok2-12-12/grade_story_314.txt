<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "overworked" trait feels underutilized. Her transformation is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The bread box discovery feels abrupt, though the ghostly confrontation resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting is vivid and immersive, but the "observation post" detail feels tacked on. Atmosphere enhances the supernatural encounter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact and thematic depth, but the "laughing tears" tone wobbles. Literary devices are used effectively, though the ending leans didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the supernatural twist, but some phrases ("genuinely fake") feel forced. Avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering thought but could be sharper.</comment>
