<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "ethically questionable" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her cosmic pursuit, but the depth of her philosophical nature is superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts without grounding them in tangible stakes. The knitting-to-cosmic-revelation arc is unique but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The jazz age setting and gaslit atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. However, the "time capsule" aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, mug) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract focus. The ending resolves neatly but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but some phrasing leans generic ("cosmic wonder," "numb fascination"). The gardening gloves and mug codes are fresh touches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its abstract focus. The jazz age backdrop is underused as a narrative driver.</comment>
