<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's sorrow and motivation are clear, but her emotional depth could be more nuanced. The plastic spoon as a heirloom adds a unique touch, but her "painful joy" feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the dream catcher decoding feels abrupt. The ending resolves neatly, though the pacing near the climax is rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The exiled fortress and library setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spoon, dream catchers) and emotional resonance, but the theme of legacy could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (exiled hero, oracle). The plastic spoon is a fresh twist, but some phrasing feels slightly formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the word limit strains the plot's complexity. Leaves a lingering question about Elara's sacrifice.</comment>
