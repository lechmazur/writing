<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The calm doomsayer's motivation is clear and consistent, with his placid ferocity effectively contrasting the chaos around him. His use of the skateboard as a relic of childhood adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The train whistle as a trigger for reflection works well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and sunrise setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (gears, steam, train whistle) enhancing the atmosphere and supporting the character's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skateboard stickers, gods of stagnation) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of steampunk and nostalgia, but some phrases verge on formulaic ("placid ferocity"). Avoids clich√©s but could push further in subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about reclaiming innocence, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
