<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's ambition and motivation are clear, but his dual focus on brewing and dialects feels slightly underdeveloped. Bolt's loyalty is well-established but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The discovery of the chamber feels earned, though the transition from brewing to dialects could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and emotion, with strong symbolism (the straw as a pen). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "lost paths" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, but some phrases lean slightly toward formulaic. The handling of emotion is nuanced but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some themes could be expanded.</comment>
