<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's guarded nature and motivation to learn extinct crafts are well-developed and drive her actions consistently. Her skepticism adds depth, though her "angry peace" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the bookmark's discovery, but the grassroots movement integration feels slightly rushed. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood, though its connection to the bookmark could be stronger. Atmosphere supports Elara's journey well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, vows) and emotional resonance. Ending is purposeful, but some themes could be deeper. "Angry peace" tone is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the "nano-forest" risks feeling gimmicky. Avoids clich√©s but could push originality further in character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and serve the story well. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
