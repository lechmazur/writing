<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear, but his transformation feels abrupt. The "sullen farmer" archetype is underdeveloped, lacking deeper nuance or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but leans on predictable beats. The connection between stamps and quilt as catalysts for change is logical but overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The underwater setting is evocative but underutilized. Sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (stamps, quilt) is heavy-handed. The ending is satisfying but lacks subtext. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©d tropes (abandoned city, quilt as metaphor). Prose is functional but lacks stylistic distinction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements feel assembled rather than organically fused. The story is cohesive but lacks lingering depth or surprise.</comment>
