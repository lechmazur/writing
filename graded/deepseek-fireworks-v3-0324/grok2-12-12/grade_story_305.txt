<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's reticence and technically mischievous nature are well-integrated, but his motivation to "dethrone complacency" feels slightly abstract and could be more concretely tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the scholar's discovery, though the cake-baking subplot feels tangential. The echoes' introduction and resolution are effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the eerie tone. Sensory details are used effectively to heighten the surreal mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and thought, with strong use of symbolism (tablet as conduit). The ending is satisfying, though some emotional depth could be further developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into predictable "scholar uncovers ancient secret" tropes. The tone avoids purple prose, but some phrases feel overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite the many elements. The brief length works, though the cake-baking detracts slightly from the central mystery.</comment>
