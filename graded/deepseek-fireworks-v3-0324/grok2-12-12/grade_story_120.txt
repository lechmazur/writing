<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sam's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "privately public" attribute feels underdeveloped. The fishing lure effectively symbolizes his trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the quantum tunnel's mechanics could be more logically integrated. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel and "excited boredom" tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (raindrop, nest) enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lure, nest) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of acceptance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("excited boredom") feel contrived. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the quantum tunnel feels slightly forced. The story lingers, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
