<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "typically atypical" nature feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his desire for escape and self-determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the magician’s deck, but the transition to the island feels abrupt. Pacing is effective within the word limit, though some cause-and-effect relationships could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war setting are evocative, and the atmosphere enhances Eli's journey. Sensory details like the "song of boundaries" are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the deck, the song) and delivers a satisfying ending. However, the theme of "raw solace" could be deeper, and some emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and a unique premise. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the narrative avoids clichés and maintains a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity works, but the ending could linger more.</comment>
