<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unhinged zealot" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on ritualistic action without escalating tension or stakes. The whispered confession resolves too neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The jungle and parlor clash evocatively, but sensory details (e.g., the bottle cap's glow) feel contrived rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (bottle cap, confession) is overt, and the ending lacks ambiguity. The prose is polished but risks pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (mad scholar, jungle mysticism). The "earnest absurdity" tone wavers into self-seriousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but the story feels like a vignetteâ€”compelling yet incomplete, lacking lasting resonance.</comment>
