<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The juggler's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "frenzied" nature feels underdeveloped. The love letter adds depth, but his "peculiarly functional" attribute lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, though the tea leaves method feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, but the void's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The yawning void and abandoned summer create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (love letter, tea leaves) and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (void, lost libraries). The juggler's "frenzy" feels more stated than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits thematic resonance. The style is deliberate, though some phrases border on purple prose.</comment>
