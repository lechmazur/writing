<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear but his "ordinarily extraordinary" trait feels underdeveloped. His reaction to the dentures reveals curiosity but lacks deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the dentures' significance feels abrupt. Pacing is solid, though the climax lacks tension. Cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bookstore's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the mountain setting is underutilized. Sensory details (old paper scent) enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (dentures as legacy) works, but emotional impact is muted. Ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance. Theme of warmth is clear but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "bard inspires audience" trope. Some fresh metaphors (e.g., "fractured idyll"), but prose occasionally veers into generic warmth/clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel serviceable rather than inspired. Length suits the vignette, though the mountain setting begs deeper exploration.</comment>
