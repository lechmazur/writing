<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her transformation feels abrupt; her "underachieving" trait is underdeveloped before her sudden empowerment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the doll head's role as a key artifact lacks sufficient setup or explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements feel crammed; the farmland timeframe is tangential, and the space station's purpose is unclear.</comment>
