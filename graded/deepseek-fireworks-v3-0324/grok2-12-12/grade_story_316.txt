<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seamstress's timid yet determined nature is well-developed, and her motivation is clear and consistent. Her actions align with her childhood promise, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the scoreboard and weaving feels slightly forced. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, blending ancient and modern elements effectively. Sensory details enhance the atmosphere, though the arcade feels slightly out of place.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery, with a satisfying ending. The theme of collective healing is explored thoughtfully, though some emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its approach but leans slightly on tropes (e.g., the "mending fabric" metaphor). Language is purposeful, though some phrases feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though some thematic depth is implied rather than fully explored.</comment>
