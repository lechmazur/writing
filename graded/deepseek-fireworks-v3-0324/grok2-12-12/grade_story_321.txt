<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his internal conflict, but his "almost radical" attribute feels underdeveloped and somewhat forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the dreamlike hourglass resolution feels slightly abrupt given the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, but the "abrasive calm" tone occasionally clashes with the setting's intensity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into abstract phrasing at times, risking emotional detachment. Some tropes (redemption arc) are handled predictably.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its own ambition. The brevity works, yet deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
