<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivations and personality are vividly drawn, with his lonesome, stubborn nature and cloud-reading tradition clearly shaping his actions and dialogue. His distinct voice and reactions to the Bellwethers add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the bickering and cloud-reading driving the narrative. The ending feels purposeful, though the tight word limit slightly truncates the rivalry's resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic metropolis and rooftop stables create a striking, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "voice like worn velvet," "automated traffic") enrich the world and tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the stamp, clouds) and subtext (tradition vs. data). The ending lingers, though the conflict's resolution could be sharper. Dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of futuristic and archaic elements feels fresh, and the prose is evocative without being purple. Emotion is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. Creative and layered, with a clear theme.</comment>
