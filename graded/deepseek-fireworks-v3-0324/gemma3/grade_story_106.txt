<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's sullenness and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his transformation feeling organic yet desperate. His "borrowed valor" adds depth, though his sudden shift to action could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's inspiration, but the underwater city's introduction feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (dust, quilt, stamps) enhancing the mood. The underwater city's mystique is compelling but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (stamps as blueprints, quilt as map) is striking, and the ending resonates. However, the theme of "erasing boundaries" could be more explicitly woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the quilt-stamp fusion, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases ("borrowed valor") verge on overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the short length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, though the underwater city's logic could be tighter.</comment>
