<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot pivots sharply from culinary intrigue to digital apocalypse, which is bold but slightly disjointed. Pacing is tight, though the transition could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly rendered, with neon and grime enhancing the dystopian mood. Sensory details (spice, reflections) deepen immersion.</comment>
