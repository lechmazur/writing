<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaito's "lovingly detached" nature is subtly but effectively woven into his actions and motivations, creating a compelling paradox. His vow and meddling habit reveal depth, though his swordsman aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The collage assembly drives the narrative forward elegantly, and the ending feels purposeful, though the "secret weavers" concept could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center is vividly rendered with sensory details (metallic scent, bioluminescent algae). The sea pottery’s juxtaposition with high-tech debris enhances atmosphere and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (memory, loss) and literary craftsmanship (symbolism, fractured harmony) elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the weavers’ role could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "fractured harmony"). Avoids clichés, though the swordsman trope leans slightly generic. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the brevity feels deliberate. The sea pottery and vow lend depth, leaving a haunting impression. Minor quibble: the weavers’ mystique could be sharper.</comment>
