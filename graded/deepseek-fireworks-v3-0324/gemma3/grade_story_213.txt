<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's character is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His actions align with his established traits, though his sudden resolve could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's symbolic act, but the transition from quiet observer to decisive actor feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is underutilized; the restaurant's atmosphere is evoked well but lacks deeper connection to the core conflict. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be deepened with more showing vs. telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The hair clip metaphor is fresh, though Thorne's dialogue leans toward stereotype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the lab setting feels tacked on. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about hope vs. pragmatism.</comment>
