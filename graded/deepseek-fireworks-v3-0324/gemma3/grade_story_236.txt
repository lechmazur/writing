<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's meekness and role as a blacksmith in a city that doesn't need metal create a poignant contrast. His motivation to harness heartbreak is clear and consistent, though his emotional detachment could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the verification process driving the narrative forward logically. The ending feels purposeful, though the "something" the city moves toward remains slightly vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent coral and crystalline structures enhancing the melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (damp dictionary, dissolving tear) are masterfully used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and subtext, using sorrow as energy with striking originality. Literary devices (e.g., "hush of time’s final ripple") elevate the prose, though the theme of regret borders on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The premise of heartbreak as fuel is fresh, and the writing style is distinct. Some phrases ("luminous regret") verge on repetitive but remain evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache. Only minor refinement needed to reach perfection.</comment>
