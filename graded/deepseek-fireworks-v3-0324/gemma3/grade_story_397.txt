<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's jaded yet hopeful demeanor is well-developed, and his motivation to understand Vance's work feels organic. His actions align with his curiosity and desperation, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's investigation, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect is clear, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's humming atmosphere and fireworks' contrast are vividly rendered. Sensory details (scalpel's cold weight, crystal glow) deepen immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scalpel as key, doodles as fate's language) and subtext. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (fate as palimpsest). Avoids clich√©s, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate. Nuanced handling of desperation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about fate's malleability, suggesting depth.</comment>
