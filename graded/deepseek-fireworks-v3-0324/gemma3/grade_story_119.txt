<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his unique ability and moral compass. His actions align well with his established traits, though his "sometimes always" awareness could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the roller coaster setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival creates a vivid atmosphere, but the connection to the astral projection concept is tenuous. Sensory details are strong but could be more integrated with the core theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the key, shadows) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of compassion vs. weaponization could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The astral projection twist is inventive, but the "practiced spontaneity" tone feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful, with creative use of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
