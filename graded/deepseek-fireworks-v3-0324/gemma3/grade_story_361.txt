<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with his unconventional methods and quiet defiance aligning well with his role as a guardian of fading knowledge. His distinct voice and mechanical intuition add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's ritualistic actions, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are clear, but the pacing could benefit from more breathing room.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and looming city create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the metallic coffee and flickering neon enhance the mood of fragility and change.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (equations as defiance) and subtext, though the ending feels slightly abrupt. The writing style is purposeful, and the conflict between progress and preservation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (dice as a "focusing lens") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic writing, though the "hearth" concept feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering thought about cultural preservation, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
