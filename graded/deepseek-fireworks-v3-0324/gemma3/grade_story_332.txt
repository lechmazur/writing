<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's solitude and artistic sensitivity are vividly portrayed, with his motivation (seeking meaning in vulnerability) clear and consistent. His actions align with his introspective nature, and his 'voice' is distinct through his observations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Tiber's resuscitation attempt driving the narrative logically. The connection between beginning (isolation) and end (connection) is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden and bioluminescent flora create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (whispering metal blooms, luminous moss) enhance the mood and reflect Tiber's inner world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (notepad as a canvas, garden as a mirror to emotion) and subtext (isolation vs. shared humanity). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with a clear emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of vulnerability and human connection feels fresh, and the prose is purposeful without being ornate. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity enhances its impact, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
