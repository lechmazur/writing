<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's reticence and scholarly demeanor are well-established, but his technical mischievousness feels slightly underdeveloped. His motivation to dethrone complacency is clear but could benefit from deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to revelation. The unconventional method (knocking) and its payoff are coherent and satisfying, though the cake-baking framing feels slightly tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered, with sensory details (vanilla scent, flickering lanterns) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's themes and Alistair's actions perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (the cake as an offering) and subtext (academic rebellion). The ending is resonant, though the "pensive mirth" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "the opera house breathed"). Minor AI-like phrasing ("technically mischievous") stands out, but the overall voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Only the cake's role slightly weakens cohesion.</comment>
