<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions and reactions revealing a nuanced character. His alchemist background and suburban life create an interesting contrast, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The word limit is well-managed, achieving a complete arc without feeling rushed. The chain-reactive coincidences method is inventive but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the tar pit and watchtowers creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The timeframe (butterfly emergence) adds poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact and thematic depth, with strong symbolism (coin, butterfly) and a satisfying ending. The theme of kinship is woven seamlessly into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful. The story feels fresh, with no AI-generated artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with all elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers in the mind. Creative and deeply thoughtful.</comment>
