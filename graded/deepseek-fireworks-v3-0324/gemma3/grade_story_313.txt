<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his interrogation of ghosts revealing his defiant resilience. His "unusually normal" attribute and con artist background shape his actions well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced effectively, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between Tiber's scheme and his ghostly interrogations is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., "sunlight was a forgotten myth") enhancing the atmosphere. The ghosts and setting are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and emotion, with strong symbolism (the tape dispenser) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of remorse could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the writing style is distinct. Only minor stiffness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about resilience and failure.</comment>
