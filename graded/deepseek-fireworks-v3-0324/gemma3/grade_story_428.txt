<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his shift to studying constellations feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his "rarely authentic" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the handshake and the celestial study could be smoother. The ending resolves his arc effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple setting and "daring caution" tone are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., chipped sandstone, tarnished blotter) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter, broken stars) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue with Kaelen could feel less expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The ink blotter metaphor is fresh, and Elias's emotional nuance elevates it beyond formulaic AI writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
