<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's gentle swordsman persona and xenophile curiosity are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "faithfully unfaithful" nature adds depth, though his dialogue is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sundial's coded angles driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The museum at night is atmospheric and evocative, with sensory details (hollow bones, humming) enhancing the mood. The setting perfectly complements Tiber's cosmic yearning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (matchbox as stardust) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, and the theme of late-blooming wonder resonates deeply. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "cradle the universe") are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown, not told. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic tenderness.</comment>
