<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and compelling, blending his professional role with personal stakes. His "peculiar faith" in dreams as blueprints for reality is original and drives his actions convincingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The tension between Tiber's goals and the shadowy figures' agenda is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly rendered, with sensory details (metallic tang, phantom rye bread) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's themes of memory and time.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (vapor streams, Thorne-mask) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the conflict's resolution could be more nuanced. The theme of rewriting reality is explored with depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The premise and execution feel fresh, with nuanced emotion (e.g., Tiber's grandmother's rye bread as emotional anchor). Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. The combination of dream interpretation and temporal manipulation is striking.</comment>
