<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions and reactions revealing layers of grief and obsession. Elara's telepathy adds a unique dynamic, though her role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the button hook serving as a pivotal revelation. Pacing is strong, though the glacial focus slightly overshadows the dock's relevance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dock and icy setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details (e.g., tarnished silver, lukewarm coffee) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ice patterns, cloaks) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending resonates emotionally, though Elara's telepathy feels underutilized for thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clich√©s. Tiber's "efficiently inefficient" method and Lyra's cloaks are fresh, though the telepathy element leans slightly gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the theme of connection. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on love and impermanence.</comment>
