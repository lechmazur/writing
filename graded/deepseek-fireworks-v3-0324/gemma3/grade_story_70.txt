<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's transformation from rigidity to emotional openness is compelling, though his initial "certainly uncertain" trait feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the adhesive analysis method driving both mystery and emotional revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse-gravestone setting is hauntingly vivid, and sensory details (ozone, damp stone) deepen the atmosphere of latent grief.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (light bulb as grief vessel) and subtext. The ending’s quiet catharsis lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "solidified echo of emotion"). Minor stiffness in Tiber’s early introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant thematic weight.</comment>
