<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "logically emotional" need to understand endings driving his actions. The child’s skeleton key necklace adds depth to his backstory without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Tiber's overreach leading to a meaningful discovery. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending resolves the arc while leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Whispering Gallery and final countdown create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the garden's phantom scent) are evocative and deepen the world's melancholy tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the necklace, the chamber) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, and the theme of memory as survival is delivered with subtlety and impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "grandiose modesty" tone is distinctive, and the emotional resonance feels earned, not stated. No AI-generated flatness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, and the narrative lingers with thematic weight. A standout piece with minimal flaws.</comment>
