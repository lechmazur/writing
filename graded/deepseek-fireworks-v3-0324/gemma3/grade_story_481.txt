<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's perceptiveness and cartographer background are well-integrated into his motivation and actions. Elara's role as a "navigator" ties neatly into his expertise, though Dr. Aris's detachment could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's need to convince Aris, but the forge's rhythmic clang as a method feels slightly forced. The ending achieves a sense of progression but leaves some threads unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital ward and the dragonfly’s symbolism create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the forge’s clang and the sterile white lines enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dragonfly, forge) and subtext (corruption vs. change). The dialogue is purposeful, though Aris’s shift feels abrupt. The theme of cosmic wreckage lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and nuanced, avoiding clichés. The dragonfly and forge are fresh metaphors. Emotion is shown through subtext, not stated. The tone is consistent and distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. Creative combination of sci-fi and literary introspection.</comment>
