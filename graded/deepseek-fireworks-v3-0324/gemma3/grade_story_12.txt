<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's aloofness and cartographer background are well-integrated into his personality and actions, but his motivation to "learn the language of the soul" feels slightly abstract. His interaction with the cracked tile reveals depth, though his shift from resignation to hope could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the futuristic mall setting feels underutilized. The kayaking connection is organic, though the pacing slightly rushes the emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The futuristic mall contrasts intriguingly with Tiber's nostalgia, but the setting lacks immersive sensory details. The cracked tile's symbolism is strong, but the atmosphere could better support the theme of memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the tile) and subtext (memory vs. futurism). The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural, though the theme could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of futurism and nostalgia, but some phrases verge on overly poetic ("eager resignation"). The emotional nuance is strong, though the kayaking element feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves its elements, and the brevity feels deliberate. The cracked tile and Tiber's growth linger, though the mall setting could be more integral.</comment>
