<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Beatrice's sass and academic mischief are vividly portrayed, but her transition from cook to reality saboteur feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the polaroid's function and Beatrice's actions driving a clear, escalating tension. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile office and twilight setting amplify the story's eerie, destabilizing mood. Sensory details (e.g., the camera's ghostly lens) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext about chaos vs. order, with potent symbolism (the polaroid as a "seed"). The ending lingers, though the theme could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and premise. The polaroid's twist and Beatrice's arrogance avoid clich√©, though her cook role feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
