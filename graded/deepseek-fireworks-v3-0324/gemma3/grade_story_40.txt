<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character development is strong, with Tiber's reincarnated past and guilt clearly shaping his actions. Clara's motivation is also well-defined, though Tiber's "tentatively fierce" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the storm and Clara's arrival driving the narrative. The resolution feels earned, though the "doctor’s chart" reference is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (vanilla, decay, aged paper) enhancing the setting. The library and storm work symbiotically to reinforce mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling is impactful, with layered themes of redemption and connection. Symbolism (toy soldier, plum pudding) is deftly handled, though the ending's optimism slightly undercuts the earlier cynicism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The reincarnation premise avoids cliché, though the "playful cynicism" tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity enhances its emotional resonance.</comment>
