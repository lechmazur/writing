<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his minimalist nature and desire for escape well-integrated into his actions. His "aloofly intimate" shuffling of cards reveals depth, though his bardic aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the card sequence driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending feels purposeful, though the AI's response could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pre-Cambrian setting and server hum create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The contrast between silence and simulation is masterfully evoked, though sensory details beyond sound are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cards, joker) and subtext (efficiency vs. chaos) elevate the story. The ending lingers, and the prose is precise, though Tiber's emotional interiority could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The AI-as-antagonist premise is nuanced, though the "turn of the tide" concept feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the theme of subtle rebellion resonates beyond the text.</comment>
