<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and well-developed, though Tiber's "sincere rebel" trait could be more vividly shown through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the passage's "living entity" twist feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details enhancing the haunted passage and the city's decay. The "between storms" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the living passage concept, but some phrases ("braided bitterness") verge on overworked. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, though the sticky note's prominence feels slightly contrived. The brevity serves the story well.</comment>
