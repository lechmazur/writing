<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his grief and quest for truth driving his actions. His sardonic glee and meticulous nature are well-integrated into his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to confrontation. The peacock tail metaphor feels slightly forced but doesn’t derail the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sterile test facility contrasts effectively with Tiber’s organic obsessions, but the setting lacks deeper immersion or sensory richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (peacock, seal) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the conspiracy reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Tiber’s voice and the peacock motif stand out, though the facility’s role could be more inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about the conspiracy’s scope.</comment>
