<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his irate nature contrasting poignantly with his vulnerability. His use of the pendant reveals a hidden tenderness, but his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition into the bedroom could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen 1988 bedroom is vividly rendered, with sensory details (lemon polish, dust motes) amplifying the atmosphere. The static setting mirrors Tiber's emotional stasis brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pendant as compassion) and subtext (generational trauma). The ending is resonant, though the "sardonic glee" motif slightly overpowers the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors ("desperation was a potent catalyst"). Minor quibble: "sardonic glee" recurs too predictably, hinting at algorithmic rhythm.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about forgiveness.</comment>
