<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's mild panic and sarcasm are well-integrated into his actions and dialogue, revealing a nuanced, weary soothsayer. His motivation to influence fate is clear, though his skepticism could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the puzzle box's mechanics could be clearer. The ending hints at change but feels tentative, not fully resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert and billboard maze are vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's surreal tension. Sensory details (wood grain, heat) ground the mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (water rings, locks) and subtext (cycles of failure). The prose is polished, though the sarcasm occasionally overpowers deeper emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (time as "viscous honey"). Avoids clich√©s, but the environmental stewardship critique leans slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question about futile intervention, though the climax lacks punch.</comment>
