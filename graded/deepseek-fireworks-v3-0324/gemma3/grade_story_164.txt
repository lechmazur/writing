<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's wistful nature and blacksmith background are well-integrated, but his "drifting arrogance" feels slightly underdeveloped. His motivation is clear, though his reaction to the seed pod could reveal more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between dust-mapping and reclaiming the wild could be sharper. The ending resolves neatly but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is vivid and enhances the contrast between Tiber’s dreams and reality. Sensory details (neon lights, dust motes) are used effectively to build atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seed pod, sky-bloom) and subtext, but the emotional resonance is slightly muted. The theme of hope is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, though the "drifting arrogance" tone wobbles. The dust-mapping method is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering impression, though the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
