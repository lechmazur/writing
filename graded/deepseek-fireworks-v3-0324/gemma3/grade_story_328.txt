<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's assertively meek nature is subtly but effectively portrayed, and his motivation to disconnect from technology is clear and consistent. The traveler's desperation and resolve are also well-conveyed, though her backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from introduction to resolution. The action of weaving the tapestry to disrupt digital signals drives the story logically and maintains pacing. The word limit is used efficiently without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Mirage Oasis is vividly rendered, with sensory details (fireworks, ceramic, dust) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting complements the theme of digital intrusion, and the contrast between analog and digital is immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (gold threads, fading signal) and subtext (resistance to technology) effectively. The ending is purposeful, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme of analog vs. digital is explored with depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "labyrinth of algorithms"). The emotional resonance is nuanced, and the writing style is distinctive without being overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively integrates its elements. The brief length feels deliberate, and the narrative leaves a lingering thought about resistance to technology. The elements serve the story rather than vice versa.</comment>
