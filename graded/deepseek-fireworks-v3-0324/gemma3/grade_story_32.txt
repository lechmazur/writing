<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grim sentinel's motivation is clear and compelling, though his "literally unique" attribute could be more deeply explored to enhance his distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coin-toss method driving the narrative forward logically and cohesively, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town setting and dawn timeframe are vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, sound) amplifying the atmosphere and character's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coin, pamphlet) and subtext (simulation, memory). The ending lingers with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept. The coin-toss method and simulated reality premise avoid clich√©s, though some phrasing edges toward over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that leverages its brevity for maximal impact. The elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
