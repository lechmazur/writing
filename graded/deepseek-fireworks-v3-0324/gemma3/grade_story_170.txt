<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's free-spirited yet introspective nature is well-developed, and her motivation to heal through coral restoration is clear and poignant. However, her "academically artistic" attribute feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with memorizing letters driving introspection and mirroring coral restoration. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coral station and turquoise sea create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details (salt, seaweed, rough stone) immerse the reader and amplify Elara's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sewing kit = mending, coral = healing) and subtext. The ending is resonant, blending hope and vulnerability without clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding tropes. Nuanced handling of shame and longing. Language is evocative but never purple. Only minor quibble: "breathless longing" slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply felt story where elements serve theme and character. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
