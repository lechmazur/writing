<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with a distinct voice and nuanced reaction to the moon's influence. However, deeper exploration of Tiber's past could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the time machine's mechanics could be more grounded. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (yeast, ozone) enhancing the mystical reality. The bakery/time machine contrast is brilliant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flowers, moonlight) and subtext. The ending lingers with thematic weight, though dialogue (if added) could deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "seeds of contagion" concept is fresh, and emotional resonance is shown, not told. Minor risk of over-poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reader reflection.</comment>
