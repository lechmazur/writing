<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the "rewind" concept driving the narrative logically. The ending feels purposeful, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The automated postal facility is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, mechanical hum) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting perfectly mirrors Tiber's internal struggle.</comment>
