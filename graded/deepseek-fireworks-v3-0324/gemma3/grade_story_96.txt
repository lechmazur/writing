<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "disinterested passion" and quiet defiance shining through. His reaction to the map reveals depth, though his poet background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the map's discovery driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels purposeful, though the "volunteer stints" method could be more integrated.</comment>
