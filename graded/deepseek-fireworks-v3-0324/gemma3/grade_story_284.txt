<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's stoicism and ironic earnestness are deeply woven into his actions and reactions, revealing a nuanced internal conflict. His shift from cynicism to vulnerability is compelling and well-paced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the wallet return and paper plane serving as catalysts for Tiber's emotional arc. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The beekeeper's sanctuary contrasts brilliantly with Tiber's isolation, and sensory details (bees' drone, mead) immerse the reader. Atmosphere amplifies the theme of sincerity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (paper plane, static vs. bees) and subtext. The ending lingers, and the prose balances lyricism with precision. Dialogue is sparse but potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "navigating uncharted waters of his heart") and avoided clich√©s. Emotion is shown through subtle gestures (the gasp, clutching the plane).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on sincerity and loneliness.</comment>
