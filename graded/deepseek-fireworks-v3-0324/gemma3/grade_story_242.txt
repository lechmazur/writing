<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and nuanced, with his shift from guarding echoes to seeking connections well-executed. His actions align with his evolving loyalties, though his disguise as a maintenance bot feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc from stagnation to quiet revolution. The connection between the Great Forgetting and Tiber's actions is logical, though the tailing method could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Vault's atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (herbs, star anise) and complements the theme of controlled nostalgia. The setting enhances the story's tension and Tiber's role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herbs as signals) and subtext (truth vs. control). The ending is purposeful, though the "mirthful solemnity" tone could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The herb-based communication system is inventive, and the emotional resonance is shown, not told. Minor stiffness in Tiber's internal logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering question about truth and memory, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the revolution's setup.</comment>
