<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending personal tragedy with a cosmic goal. His voice and actions are distinct, though his "high-altitude" trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the sticky-note method's connection to the lullaby feels slightly contrived. The ending hints at progression but lacks full resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Yggdrasil-like tree and dreamscape are vividly rendered, with sensory details (burnt sugar, static cling) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting elevates the concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fabric scrap, lullaby) and subtext (universal anxiety). The ending is purposeful but could resonate more deeply emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The mundanely terrifying nightmares and cosmic lullaby twist feel fresh. Minor stiffness in dialogue ("unsettlingly familiar").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the lullaby and dreamscape weaving together. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
