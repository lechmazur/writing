<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from remorse to tentative reconciliation. The interconnected wishes method is inventive and logically integrated, though the pacing slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city and its bio-electric field are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (ozone, petrified lung-chamber) deepen immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism (mask as a conduit for forgiveness) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying yet open, leaving room for reflection. Literary devices are used deftly.</comment>
