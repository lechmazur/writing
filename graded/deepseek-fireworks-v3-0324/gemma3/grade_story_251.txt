<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's ambivalent prophet role is compelling, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His actions align with his cosmic meddling, though his "happily sad" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's defragmentation, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships slightly underdeveloped. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective, grounding the cosmic scale in tactile elements like marbles and puzzle edges.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and literary devices, the story evokes melancholy and wonder. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of cosmic debt could be more sharply resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is fresh, with nuanced emotion and a consistent tone. Only minor over-reliance on cosmic metaphors holds it back.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of cosmic whimsy.</comment>
