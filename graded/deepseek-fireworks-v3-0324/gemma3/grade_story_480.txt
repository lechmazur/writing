<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The receipt's role is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The abandoned mess hall enhances the story's eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by Leo's detachment. Ending is purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
