<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation, and his "virtually peculiar" nature shines through his actions and reactions. His use of the dice and engagement with the shifting walls reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the misalignment concept driving the narrative logically. The resolution feels earned, and pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory setting is immersive and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (dust motes, brass light) deepen the atmosphere, aligning perfectly with Silas's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dice, walls) and layered themes (chaos vs. order) elevate the storytelling. The ending resonates, and the prose is both lyrical and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The cowboy poet in a steampunk world feels fresh, and emotions are shown through action and subtext rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering thematic impact. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
