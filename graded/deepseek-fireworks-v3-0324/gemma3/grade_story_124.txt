<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's skittish nature and silent observation align well with his motivation to map the subconscious. Elara's transformation is subtle but effective, revealing depth in both characters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the connection between the loom and neural pathways could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar setting contrasts beautifully with the delicate ballet shoes, creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like the loom's "click and whirr" enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes quiet emotion and uses symbolism effectively (loom as mind, shoes as grace). The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The weaving metaphor is fresh, and the emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about memory and identity.</comment>
