<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his archaic demeanor and philosophical quest adding depth. His reactions to reflections reveal his existential curiosity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in transitions. The fragment and reflections drive the narrative, though the playground interlude feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse and sanctified dread create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (lotus dissolving, coffin fragment's pulse) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lotus, reflections) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "becoming" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The mage's voice and the surreal reflections feel fresh, though some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the fragment and reflections anchoring the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering mystique.</comment>
