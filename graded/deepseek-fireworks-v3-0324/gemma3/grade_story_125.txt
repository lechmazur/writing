<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's underachieving mage persona is well-established, but his shift from boredom to resolve feels slightly abrupt. His motivation to reclaim heritage is clear, though his initial passivity could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the doll head as a clever catalyst. The connection between the station and Tiber’s farmland is intriguing, though the "trap" concept could be more explicitly woven in earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland boundary create a vivid, desolate atmosphere. The doll head’s eerie presence enhances the mood, though sensory details beyond sight could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll head as key) and subtext (suppressed heritage). The ending is satisfying, but the emotional resonance of Kaelen’s awakening could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dormant mage"). Avoids clichés, though the "bored excitement" tone occasionally wavers. The writing style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story’s theme of hidden potential. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on legacy and self-discovery.</comment>
