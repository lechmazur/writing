<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation is clear and compelling, blending rage with a poetic defiance of perfection. His actions align well with his traits, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond its length.</comment>
