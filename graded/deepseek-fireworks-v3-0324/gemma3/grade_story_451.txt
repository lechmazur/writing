<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is compelling and clear, but his "typically unique" attribute feels underdeveloped. The actors' roles are intriguing but could benefit from deeper individualization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by high stakes, but the transition from the farmers market to Blacktooth Peak feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>
