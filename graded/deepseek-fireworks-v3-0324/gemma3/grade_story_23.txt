<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and distinct, with Tiber's whimsical yet desperate mission contrasting well with Silas's pragmatic skepticism. Their voices are unique and their actions align with their traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between Tiber's song and the shimmer-nets' reaction is subtly effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (dust, rain, blossoms in autumn) that enhance the atmosphere. The solar wind collection point and orchard create a unique, immersive backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of leaves, wind as memory) are used deftly, and the ending is satisfying. The theme of renewal is layered but could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The phantasmal humor and Tiber's eccentricity feel fresh, though the "celestial gears" metaphor edges toward familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope and cosmic harmony.</comment>
