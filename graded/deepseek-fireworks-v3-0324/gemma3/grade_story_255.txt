<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, but his "nondescript seer" label feels underdeveloped. His analytical innovation is compelling, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the USB drive and the scent method feels slightly forced. The resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., scent of rain) are immersive and enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., scent as metaphor) and subtext (justice vs. power). The ending is purposeful, though the theme could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "peeling back layers of an onion"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "innocent cynicism" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit slightly hinders thematic depth. Leaves a lingering thought but feels constrained.</comment>
