<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's spiritual materialism and motivation to understand intangible limits are well-developed and consistent, though his 'sleepy nomad' trait could be more actively integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the barbells and masquerade driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the disguise room's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The disguise room and hush timeframe create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (rust, holograms, wind chimes) deepen immersion and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (barbells → wind chimes) and subtext. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, with a clear, layered message about strength.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids clichés, though "spectacular fall" borders on generic. Nuanced handling of pride and vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on fragility and release.</comment>
