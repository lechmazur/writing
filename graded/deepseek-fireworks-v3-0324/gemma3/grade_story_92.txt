<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with his silent agreements and childhood habits shaping his actions. His "carefully careless" facade adds depth, though his curiosity could be more explicitly tied to his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blood drive revelation serving as a compelling climax. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect logic is clear, though the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mansion's gothic atmosphere is masterfully evoked, with stained-glass windows and wilting orchids enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details (metallic taste, cold air) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the garden's hunger, silence as currency) and subtext elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the central conflict (Elias's complicity) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The vampire-plant twist is fresh, though some phrases ("loud silence") verge on overused. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story leaves a haunting impression, though Elias's ultimate choice could be more impactful.</comment>
