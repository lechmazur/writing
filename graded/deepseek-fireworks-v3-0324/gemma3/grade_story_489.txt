<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but their "unseen observer" role feels slightly underdeveloped. Their actions align with their mission, but their distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the whale's call as a trigger is inventive. Pacing is excellent, though the dancer's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and oceanic atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting and object (whistle) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as conduit, dance as key) and a resonant ending elevate the story. The theme of cultural preservation is layered and impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, though "brazen calm" feels slightly forced. The whale's call and plastic whistle are fresh, unexpected choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering sense of rediscovery, though the dancer’s connection could be stronger.</comment>
