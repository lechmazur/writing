<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his defiance of finality shaping his actions and personality. His distinct voice and analytical freedom add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to resonance. The briefcase's role feels slightly abrupt but serves the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay and post-performance timeframe create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked lenses, metallic thrum) immerse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of goggles, briefcase as memory) and a resonant ending. Subtext about memory and defiance enriches the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced handling of emotion (e.g., "prickly wonder") and fresh metaphors (e.g., "braille-like bumps").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about the persistence of memory and defiance.</comment>
