<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and consistent with his quiet, deliberate nature. His actions reveal a nuanced defiance, and his "voice" is distinct despite minimal dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The catapult's repurposing is inventive, and the pacing balances urgency with contemplation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and grey sea create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the tablecloth's silver thread) enrich the world and amplify Tiber's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and subtext. The ending is poignant, and the theme of preserving joy against oblivion is powerfully conveyed through symbolism and restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The tablecloth-as-map and temporal defiance feel fresh. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, and the prose is purposeful, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative fusion of elements elevates the narrative beyond constraints.</comment>
