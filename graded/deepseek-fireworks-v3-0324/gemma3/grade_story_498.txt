<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and nuanced, with Tiber's internal conflict and subtle defiance well-portrayed. His actions align with his established traits, though his "nervous" aspect could be more consistently shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the detour serves as a clever pivot. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the council's reaction feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the setting and timeframe enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details (e.g., the seed pods, the garden's glow) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is masterful, with potent symbolism (seed pods as hope) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful and thematically rich, though the guards' shift in loyalty could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and subversion of tropes (e.g., xenophobia vs. communal gardens). Some phrases verge on overly poetic, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the "unlikely probable" motif could be more organic.</comment>
