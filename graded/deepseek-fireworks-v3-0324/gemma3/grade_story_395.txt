<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's dutiful nature and rebellious streak are well-balanced, revealing depth through her actions and the fortune cookie slip. Tiber's backstory adds intrigue, though his transition from caretaker to codebreaker could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the fortune cookie and festival serving as clever catalysts. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the manuscript reveal feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating island spa is vividly rendered, but its "hollow" atmosphere clashes mildly with the later investigative energy. Sensory details (lumiflora, soundscapes) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich subtext (rebellion vs. duty, hidden histories) elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "crescendo" metaphor is slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists (musical cipher, artist network). Minor AI tells: "forgotten dance" feels repetitive, and Tiber's exposition is overly neat.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the word limit feels intentional. Lingers on themes of secrecy and unlikely collaboration.</comment>
