<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and nuanced, with his past and present actions aligning well. His "voice" is distinct, though his dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the museum meetings feel slightly contrived. The arc is satisfying, though the resolution is subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, but its connection to the museum scenes is underdeveloped. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (crate slat) and subtext, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "accidental meetings" trope is borderline. The prose is purposeful, and the handling of guilt feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the garden's role could be deeper.</comment>
