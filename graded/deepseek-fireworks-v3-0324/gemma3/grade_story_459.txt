<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending his ghostly observations with personal catharsis. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute subtly informs his actions, though deeper exploration of his past regrets could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Arthur's dissection of the crown driving a resonant arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost tours could be more integral to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's hushed atmosphere is masterfully evoked, amplifying the ghosts' presence. Sensory details (lavender scent, rusted wire) deepen the mood, though the shoreline's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the flower crown's symbolism, the theme of letting go, and the ending's quiet resolution linger. Subtext about grief and acceptance elevates the narrative beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Arthur's emotional nuance and the lab's unique setting stand out, though "elegantly clumsy" risks leaning slightly toward quirkiness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply felt story where elements serve the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on loss and silence.</comment>
