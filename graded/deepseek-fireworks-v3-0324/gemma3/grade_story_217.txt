<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's underestimated rebel nature is well-integrated, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "sadly joyful" facade adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. The word limit is used efficiently, though the ending's hopeful ambiguity slightly disrupts closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Joyland's haunted house is vividly rendered, with sensory details (mildew, cotton candy) enhancing atmosphere. The setting amplifies tension and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (adaptation as rebellion) and layered symbolism (resonators, knife). The ending lingers, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists (Szechuan cuisine as rebellion). Minor AI-like phrasing in descriptions, but emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the haunted house and adaptation theme elevate each other. A standout in brevity and depth.</comment>
