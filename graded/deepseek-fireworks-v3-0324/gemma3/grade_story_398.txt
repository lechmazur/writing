<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and nuanced, with Tiber's cynicism and Lyra's quest for answers driving the narrative effectively. Their distinct voices and reactions to shared dreams reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The shared dream device and calendar as a key are seamlessly integrated, and pacing balances urgency with reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (crumbling lighthouse, shuddering spinning wheels). The sanctuary's liminality and the sea's rhythm enhance thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (ashes, tides) and subtext. The ending is satisfying yet open, and the theme of re-spinning hope lingers. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "dysfunctionally functional") feel fresh. Emotional depth is shown, not told, and the narrative voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically. The brevity serves the story’s meditative quality, and the interplay of dreams, history, and craftsmanship leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
