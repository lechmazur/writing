<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "physically metaphysical" attribute feels underdeveloped, slightly weakening his distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the driftwood orchard's mechanics could be more grounded to avoid slight incoherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with sensory details (e.g., driftwood groaning, wooden birds pulsing) elevating the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (dances as keys, currents as steps) and emotional resonance shine, though the "storm of secrets" theme could be more explicitly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Only a hint of over-formality ("physically metaphysical") holds it back from flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, hauntingly memorable story where elements serve the narrative elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
