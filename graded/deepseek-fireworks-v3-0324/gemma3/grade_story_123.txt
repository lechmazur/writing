<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and deeply integrated with the setting and theme. Tiber's "gleefully morose" disposition and brewing as a form of preservation are compelling, though his dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, but the transition from solitude to the scout's arrival feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the setting enhancing the story's melancholy and hope. Sensory details (dust, brewing herbs) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (boots, brewing) and subtext (empire as memory). Ending is poignant, though the dialogue could delve deeper into thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The blend of nostalgia and political transition feels fresh, though some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection. A few tighter transitions would elevate it further.</comment>
