<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's spinelessness and curiosity are well-integrated, but his lack of malice slightly undermines the cult leader archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with Lyra's grafting refusal and subsequent manipulation forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse city and toxic rain create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (rain, plants, ceramic owl) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flowers, tears, owl) and subtext about control and memory. Ending lingers with melancholic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though Tiber's "scientist of the soul" motif edges toward over-formality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
