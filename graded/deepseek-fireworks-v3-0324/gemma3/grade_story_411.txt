<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into his character, with his actions and reactions revealing a nuanced, melancholic yet purposeful personality. His "voice" is distinct, though slightly more dialogue could solidify it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc despite the brevity. The connection between Tiber's study and the fragments is logical, though the ending's philosophical reflection slightly overshadows the plot's momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and star-river are vividly rendered, with sensory details (bioluminescence, murmuring water) enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements Tiber's work and the story's tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (opera glasses, mosaic of regret) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the theme of "exultant grief" could be more sharply contrasted earlier for greater impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "mechanic of souls") and minimal clich√©s. The emotional nuance avoids sentimentality, though the "repulsively attractive" descriptor feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy. Minor tightening of Tiber's paradoxes (rust/chrome) could heighten cohesion.</comment>
