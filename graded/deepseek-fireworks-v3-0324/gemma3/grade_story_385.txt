<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with clear, consistent motivation. Tiber's manipulative nature and Thorne's fractured psyche are well-explored, though Thorne's backstory could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by Tiber's manipulations, but the connection between the skates and the symbols feels slightly underdeveloped. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with the obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward creating a stark contrast. Sensory details (fading footprints, rusted skates) enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skates, footprints) and subtext. Ending is purposeful, but the central conflict (Tiber vs. Thorne's unraveling) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of "scattered seeds" is fresh, though the skyscraper feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about Thorne's fate and Tiber's true intentions.</comment>
