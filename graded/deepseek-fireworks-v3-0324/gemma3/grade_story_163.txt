<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, blending her lost identity with a drive to unify realities. Her "bitterly optimistic" nature is distinct and influences her actions well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the parking stub and detour logically leading to the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-effect relationships are clear.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the cloud migration and research station enhancing the story's eerie, fractured atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "faded ink," "shuddered station") immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (parking stub as a key) and subtext (rebuilding vs. unifying). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, with strong emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fragmented reality concept is fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while maintaining stylistic flair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
