<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lord Ashworth's submissive nature and empathy are well-integrated, driving his actions believably. His quiet defiance feels authentic, though his aristocratic background could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with echoes and the solvent swap logically advancing the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Lumiflora's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop's eerie atmosphere and acoustic anomaly are vividly rendered, enhancing tension. Sensory details (thorns, echoes) are effective, but the bioluminescent creature's presence lacks tactile depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong subtext about overlooked voices and quiet resistance. The ending is satisfying, and the letter opener's symbolism is deftly handled. Minor dialogue (agent's curse) feels natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (echoes as recordings). Avoids clich√©s, though "earnest flippancy" isn't fully realized. Nuanced emotion, but Ashworth's backstory is thinly sketched.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the letter opener and echoes serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance about hidden strength.</comment>
