<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and unique, blending memory curation with real estate. His actions align well with his "weirdly static" presence and method of persuasion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution with Mrs. Gable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea platform and recycling nebula create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's ethereal tone and Tiber's role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bottles as keys to memories) and subtext (letting go vs. holding on). The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors (e.g., "memory curator"). Avoids clichés, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thought about memory’s impermanence.</comment>
