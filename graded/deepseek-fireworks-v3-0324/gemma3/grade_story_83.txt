<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent, blending cryptid research with personal legacy. His "suspiciously trusting" nature adds depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the candle wick method and Glimmer Man reveal driving coherence. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the leaf-raking hook feels slightly tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The broken-mirror lab and ozone-scented air create a vivid, unsettling atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "wax pooled like a dark secret") elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirrors, candle) and subtext (legacy vs. discovery). The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fractured reality"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "ghost of lineage" twist leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the tray and wick method feeling organic. Leaves a thematic question about inherited secrets.</comment>
