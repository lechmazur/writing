<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and consistent, with his frenzied juggling and tea-leaf interpretation revealing a desperate, poetic attempt to preserve lost knowledge. His distinct voice and actions align well with his peculiar function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the love letter serving as a pivot from preservation to purpose. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect logic (tea leaves → letter → hidden chamber) feels organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The yawning void and abandoned summer create a haunting, liminal atmosphere. Sensory details (chipped porcelain, tarnished silverware) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies Tiber's isolation and mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (juggling as prayer, tea leaves as maps) and a resonant theme—resurrecting purpose, not just relics—elevate this beyond surface narrative. The ending is both satisfying and thematically potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with no clichés. The fusion of juggling, tea-leaf divination, and sunken libraries feels fresh. Nuanced emotions (muted euphoria) and vivid, specific metaphors avoid AI-generic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. Elements serve the story seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about cultural memory and the weight of preservation.</comment>
