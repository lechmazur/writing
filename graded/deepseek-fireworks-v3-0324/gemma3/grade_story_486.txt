<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly portrayed with a clear, compelling motivation. His "clumsily dexterous" nature and silent retribution against the Crowd are well-integrated, though his reality manipulation could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's pantomime critiques, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The Crowd's threat is established, but its stakes could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch’s cauldron room and ozone-scented atmosphere are richly evocative, amplifying the story’s eerie tone. The stained glass fragment ties elegantly to Elias’s power.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amethyst, Crowd) and subtext (silence as resistance). The ending lingers, though the pantomime method’s impact could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "practical illusion"). Minimal clichés, though the tech baron target leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
