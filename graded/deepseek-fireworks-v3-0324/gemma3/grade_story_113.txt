<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's hesitant yet impactful presence is well-developed, and his motivation to preserve joy through fragile memories is clear and poignant. His use of Barnaby as a symbol of enduring love adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Tiber's task to Hemlock's emotional shift. The dream-hopping method is inventive but slightly rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and desolate beach dreamscape are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone. Sensory details like the "sickly blue glow" immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (Barnaby, sandcastles) and layered themes (memory, joy vs. sorrow) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, leaving room for reflection on resilience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clich√©s. Tiber's "shyly loud" voice and the Chronarium concept feel fresh, though the dream-hopping device edges close to familiar tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of mending memory lingers powerfully.</comment>
