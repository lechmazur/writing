<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's aimless nature and deep connection to preservation are compelling, but his "factually imaginative" trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with decoding and grilling creating a satisfying arc, though the hopscotch method risks slight contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Archive's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (cinnamon, dust) enhancing the mournful elation. Only the snowflake intro feels slightly disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (handkerchief, cyclical patterns), resonant theme, and a poignant ending. Minor quibble: "seeds of vigilance" could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The hopscotch-as-recipe conceit is fresh, though the "mournful elation" tone occasionally tips into overt melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, elegant vignette. The brevity serves the story, leaving a lingering ache of cultural loss.</comment>
