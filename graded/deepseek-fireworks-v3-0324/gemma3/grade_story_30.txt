<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and compelling, blending gambling with a noble cause. His telekinetic ability and family tradition add depth, though his "sacred disorder" could be more explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by high-stakes gambling, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the tapestry and irrigation systems is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The space pirate setting and nebula imagery create a vivid atmosphere. The tapestry and lost languages enrich the world, though the navigation room could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dragons, trees) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors (e.g., "flame of his power") verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with nuanced emotion, though some phrases ("sacred disorder") feel forced. Avoids AI tropes but could push originality further in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope for Aerthos' future.</comment>
