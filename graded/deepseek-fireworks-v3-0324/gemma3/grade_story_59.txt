<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with clear motivation, though the 'mournful troubadour' archetype feels slightly familiar. The embroidered collar and star trails deepen his grief and quest effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The star trail deviation is a brilliant pivot, though the echo chamber's role could be more explicitly tied to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with concrete domes and silence amplifying Tiber's isolation. Sensory details (dust, brass astrolabe) enrich the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with layered symbolism (spirals as grief, silence as listener). The ending’s quiet acceptance is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the 'troubadour seeking cosmic answers' trope risks cliché. Nuanced handling of grief elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story’s emotional core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
