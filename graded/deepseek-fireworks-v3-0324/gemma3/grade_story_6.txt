<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and distinct, with Tiber's skepticism and Finch's trickery driving the plot. Their interactions reveal depth, though Finch's immortality could be explored more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. The twist is well-executed, though the ink factory's role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details (cinnamon, steam hiss), but the factory's emptiness could be more evocative to match the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of irony and subtext ("reckless generosity"). Ending is satisfying, though the ballad's forgettable nature feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The dragon-scale twist and Finch's fading are inventive, though the minstrel archetype leans slightly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering satisfaction, though the factory's thematic weight could be deeper.</comment>
