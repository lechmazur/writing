<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from pickpocket to conduit is compelling, though his initial motivation ("to challenge the status quo") feels slightly underdeveloped. His reactions to Barnaby reveal depth, but his "baffled" nature could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Barnaby's revelation and Silas's poetic response driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the "between appointments" timeframe adds little.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered, with sensory details (brine, shadows) amplifying the eerie atmosphere. Barnaby and the setting are perfectly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (poetry as fuel) and subtext (rebirth through art). The ending is hauntingly hopeful, and the prose elevates the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The ventriloquist dummy trope is subverted, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Some phrases ("scorching poise") verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Silas's fate.</comment>
