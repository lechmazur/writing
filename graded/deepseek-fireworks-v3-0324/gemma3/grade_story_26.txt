<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered with clear, compelling motivation tied to his family's shame. His obsession with the bell and the universal code feels authentic and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bell's animation serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk orchard and fading radio broadcast create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon, static, brass warmth) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bell as collective memory) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of cyberpunk and mystical elements. Avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("fractured neon") and nuanced emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Every element serves the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
