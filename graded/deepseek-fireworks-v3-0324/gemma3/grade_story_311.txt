<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, with his tense demeanor and subtle method of rebellion aligning well with his backstory. Vance's serene anger adds depth, though his influence could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the overheard fragments and vote ratification driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse and crater’s edge setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension and themes. Sensory details (cracked glass, biodome) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (photograph, greenhouse) and subtext (rebirth vs. control). The ending is satisfying, though Vance's empathy could be shown more dynamically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("serene anger"). Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though some phrasing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate in its brevity. Leaves a lingering hope, though Lyra's fate could be more explored.</comment>
