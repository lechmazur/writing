<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the postcards and forge serving as cohesive drivers. Pacing is excellent, and the ending feels both resolved and open-ended.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (forge as conduit, blossoms as rebellion) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The premise avoids clich√©s, and the prose is precise yet evocative, with fresh metaphors ("nurtured hope like iron").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, and the story lingers with thematic depth and emotional weight.</comment>
