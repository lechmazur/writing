<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions revealing a complex mix of resentment and longing. His "patient" nature contrasts sharply with his quiet defiance, creating a compelling character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mixtape ritual serving as a poignant resolution. Pacing is deliberate but never sluggish, and the cause-and-effect chain (hatred → defiance → release) is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is evocative but slightly underutilized. The "hush of memory" atmosphere, however, amplifies Tiber's introspection beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: the mixtapes as symbols of unrequited love and defiance, the bittersweet ending, and the layered subtext elevate this beyond mere plot. Literary devices are wielded with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with no clichés. The "hollow victory" theme is nuanced, and Tiber's emotions are shown, not told. The prose avoids excess while remaining vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering melancholy. Creative and deeply human.</comment>
