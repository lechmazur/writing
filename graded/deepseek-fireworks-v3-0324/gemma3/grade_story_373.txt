<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris Thorne's motivation is clear and compelling, blending cybernetics with veterinary care in a unique way. His "uniquely effective" methods and taboo-breaking drive are consistent and reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from problem to resolution. The connection between the bucket and Flicker’s healing is logical, though the motel rummaging feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent coral setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story’s mood. Sensory details (ash, iron, pulsing polyps) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s subtext—challenging perceptions of synthetic suffering—is strong. Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are used effectively, though the ending’s thematic punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés and AI-generic phrasing. The cybernetic veterinarian premise is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers due to its thematic depth.</comment>
