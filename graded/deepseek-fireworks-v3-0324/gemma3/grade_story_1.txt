<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's agoraphobia is deeply integrated into his character and motivation, revealing sensitivity rather than weakness. His "mundanely spiritual" pursuit feels organic, though his stunt double background is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The garage sales, envelope, and pyramid library form a cohesive arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pyramid library and nets are vividly rendered, with sensory details (humming strands, salt scent) enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of echoes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (nets as memory filters) and subtext (fear as sensitivity). The ending is resonant, and the prose avoids clich√© while maintaining emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "gray static of his fear"). No AI tropes detected; the voice is distinct and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
