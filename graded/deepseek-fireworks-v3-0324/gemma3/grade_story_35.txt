His motivation is clear, and his actions align with his longing for connection and completion of Elara's work.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Tiber's arrival at the Center to his emotional revelation. The pacing is effective, and the cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., the retreat triggering memories) are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile, artificial setting of the Center contrasts powerfully with Tiber's earthy background and the organic nature of his memories. Sensory details (lavender, bird calls) enhance immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional impact, using symbolism (the purse, the bird calls) and subtext (Elara's integration into the system) to create depth. The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and offers a fresh, original take on memory and emotion. The handling of Tiber's longing and Elara's fate is nuanced, and the prose is purposeful without being overly ornate.</comment>
