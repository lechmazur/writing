<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and distinct, with Tiber's meticulous control contrasting sharply with Leo's instinct-driven actions. However, Tiber's "careful poisoner" aspect feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical progression. The scavenger hunt drives the narrative effectively, though the "poisoner" element feels tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details like "dusty starlight" and the museum's relics enhancing the mood. The setting feels integral to the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is masterful, with strong symbolism (the feather, the rapier) and subtext about intuition vs. control. The ending is satisfying and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "code of instinct" theme is handled with nuance, though the "poisoner" descriptor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. Leaves a lingering question about the nature of intuition and control.</comment>
