<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tiber's wry caretaker persona and his millennia-spanning motivation to silence the "what if" siren song are deeply intertwined, creating a compelling and distinct character. His actions and voice align perfectly with his aloof yet warm demeanor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Tiber's vanishing act serving as a logical culmination of his arc. The connection between the beginning (dusting chronometers) and end (dissolving into time) is elegant and complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold's atmosphere—ozone, regret, chalk dust—enhances the story's melancholic tone. Sensory details (the dial tone, cloud patterns) are evocative and deepen the thematic weight of time's passage.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (chalk, chronometers) and subtext (time as an ocean). The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the prose style elevates the story's emotional and philosophical impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The handling of time and Tiber's existential weariness feels fresh, with nuanced metaphors (e.g., "phantom currents pulling at the soul"). No AI-generated artifice detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on silence and consequence.</comment>
