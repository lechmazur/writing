<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His "gracefully awkward" attribute adds depth, though his lumberjack background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The temporal war concept elevates the narrative, though the ossuary's revamp as a ward could be more explicitly foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ossuary setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant. Sensory details (ozone, bone décor) enhance atmosphere, though the gourmet restaurant angle feels marginally underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bones as memory channels) and subtext (healing timelines). The ending is purposeful, though Elara's role as guardian could be more subtly introduced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (chrome and fire nightmares). Avoids clichés, though the "hidden agendas" trope leans slightly generic. Nuanced emotional handling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the word limit feels deliberate. Lingers on themes of redemption and fractured time, leaving a resonant impact.</comment>
