<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bard's "fiercely nonchalant" attitude and paradoxical inability to sing yet capability to tame chaos through fire create a compelling, layered character. His motivation to chase rumors and embrace the horizon of madness is clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the bard's burning of the manuscript acting as a logical climax. The storm's resolution feels earned, and the pacing balances urgency with atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The steampunk airship dining room is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (hissing valves, clinking crystal) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the bard's outsider status and the contrast between poetry and chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Memorable prose ("ink like trapped wasps," "sky split open like a theater curtain") and rich symbolism (fire as raw order) elevate the story. The ending lingers, blending victory and ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—subverts tropes (the bard who can't sing) and avoids clichés. The handling of chaos as something "persuaded to dance" is fresh, and the voice is distinctively poetic without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for mythic resonance. Sparks genuine reflection on creativity and control.</comment>
