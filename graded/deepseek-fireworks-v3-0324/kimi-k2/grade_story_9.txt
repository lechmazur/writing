<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The soothsayer's transformation from fortune-teller to reluctant savior is compelling, though her panic feels underdeveloped compared to her resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The puzzle-box structure mirrors the thematic unraveling perfectly, with each lock serving as a micro-revelation. Pacing is taut but organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion—neon decay and water-memory create a haunting dichotomy. The desert's sarcasm elevates the setting to a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (water rings as chains, the box as regret) and a devastatingly subtle climax. The coda’s blooming cactus is masterful subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal tropes, though "molten sarcasm" occasionally veers into stylistic excess. The eco-apocalypse premise feels freshly anguished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A rare micro-story where every element serves the whole. The word limit feels expansive, not restrictive.</comment>
