<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's vexed nature and dual motives (saving vs. stealing rage) are compelling, but her backstory (mother's past) feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with precision, balancing action and reflection. The fog's transformative effect ties the riot's chaos to resolution elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with obsidian trays and fog weaving sensory magic. The falling star motif enhances the story's ethereal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("threads of fate," "ripples in mercury") and layered subtext (control vs. chaos). The ending lingers with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The spy pen and projector crystal feel fresh, though "coy malevolence" treads close to archetype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity serves the story’s mythic quality, leaving room for interpretation.</comment>
