<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and well-integrated with her traits as a "distracted inventor." Her reluctance to weaponize yet another tool adds depth, and her "weirdness" feels authentic, not forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from infiltration to forging the blade. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and cause-and-effect logic holds firm.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk alley is vividly rendered with sensory details (rust, condensation) that amplify the tone. The broken escalator and forge are brilliantly symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors ("shattered kaleidoscope"), emotional resonance, and thematic depth. The ending lingers with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh—avoids clichés, with inventive worldbuilding (memory-steel, dream-harvesting). Nuanced handling of emotion and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Leaves a haunting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
