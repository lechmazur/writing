<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's duty and emotional conflict are vividly portrayed, but her backstory with the bride could be deeper to fully anchor her motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the destruction of the clip serving as a powerful climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the restaurant setting slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab and greenhouse settings are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (chlorophyll singing, auroral greens) elevating the mood. Only the restaurant feels less integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (clip as a "blueprint for a new sun") and layered themes. The ending lingers with poetic resonance, though the bride's dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance. Only minor stiffness in phrases like "primal sophistication" keeps it from perfection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the ending sparks reflection.</comment>
