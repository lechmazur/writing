<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaede's motivations are subtle yet clear, her actions align with her role as a quiet guide. Her "dramatically subtle" attribute is reflected well, though deeper personal stakes would elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly from setup to mystical resolution. The corridor's emergence and vanishing are logical within the story's dreamlike logic. Pacing is impeccable for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (cedar, violets, meteor ash) immerse the reader. The castle's sentience and the "distant intimacy" tone are masterfully intertwined with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (petals as memory, the book as a vessel) and layered subtext. The ending lingers, though the theme of vanishing could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("heart beating like a moth against paper") and a hauntingly original premise. Avoids clich√©, though some phrases edge toward over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for mystery. A standout piece with minor room for thematic tightening.</comment>
