<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's dual motivations (death wish vs. vow to map energy) are compelling and nuanced, driving her actions convincingly. Her distinct voice emerges through introspection and sensory engagement with the bookmark.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the ice sculpture's collapse and waterfall inversion, with clear cause/effect and pacing. The resolution feels earned, though the radio-psychic method slightly strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and geomantic ritual create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "droplets hanging like stars") elevate the setting's tension and wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bookmark as map, nightshade as relinquished death) and layered themes (rebirth through witness). The ending's transformation resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clichés. The poison-taster’s role and energy-mapping premise feel fresh. Minor quibble: radio-psychics slightly disrupt the archaic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative. The brevity serves the story’s urgency, leaving a lasting impression of transcendence.</comment>
