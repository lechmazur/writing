<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin's transformation from shallow ambition to glimpsing deeper compassion is compelling, though his initial "philosophically shallow" trait could be more vividly contrasted with his later realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s propulsion by the moss’s revelation is elegant, but the transition from Arin’s greed to epiphany feels slightly abrupt in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The embassy’s crystalline foyer and bio-dome are exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (e.g., "gowns shimmered like captive nebulae") enhancing the otherworldly atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (moss as mycelium-like compassion) and layered subtext elevate the narrative, though Arin’s internal shift could benefit from more showing vs. telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the moss’s "memory" mechanic and Selu’s starlight-drinking culture, but minor phrases ("salty as oceans") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that justifies its brevity, though deeper exploration of Arin’s backstory would amplify impact.</comment>
