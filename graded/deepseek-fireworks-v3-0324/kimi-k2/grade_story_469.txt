<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character’s motivation (mapping forgotten tunnels) is clear and compelling, and her "logically emotional" attribute adds depth. The necklace as a compass/apology reveals her guilt and resolve, though her "blameless" nature could be more explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is masterful, with the countdown lending urgency. The plot arc—from key to escape—is cohesive and complete, though the tunnel’s scent-based logic risks slight contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory detail (rust, jasmine, burnt sugar) immerses the reader. The whispering gallery and garden scents merge danger and nostalgia, elevating atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (necklace as compass, map as perfume) and lyrical prose create profound impact. The ending’s thematic resonance ("cartography of survival") lingers brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original—scent-as-cartography avoids cliché. Minor overreach in "grandiose modesty" phrasing, but the voice is distinct and emotionally nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of memory and survival.</comment>
