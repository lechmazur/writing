<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from cautious smuggler to empath is nuanced and compelling, with her motivations clear and actions consistent. Her breaking point with the painter's grief is especially strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the butterfly and confession driving the arc. Pacing is efficient despite word limits, though the drought center's role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drought-stricken setting and humming server room create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (butterfly dust, anesthesia drip) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (butterfly as emotional archive) and subtext (drought as emotional barrenness). The ending's emotional payoff is profound and lingering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s; the "enthusiastic apathy" paradox and empathy-as-theft concept stand out as inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on loss and redemption.</comment>
