<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's eternal student status and detached devotion are compelling, but their motivation to master reality feels slightly abstract. The lamp's role in their journey is vivid and symbolic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from thesis to revelation. The lamp's evolution drives the narrative, though Thrum's black hole backstory feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underground city and post-stellar setting are hauntingly immersive. The lamp's ember and luminescent fungus ink elevate the atmosphere to sublime levels.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext (prophecy vs. academia, burden as gift). The ending lingers, though the lamp's hunger could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original, from mole philosophers to binary-fed galaxies. No clichés, only fresh, evocative language. The "mundanely glorious" badge is a masterstroke.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a haunting, cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for the reader’s awe.</comment>
