<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blacksmith's empathy and no-nonsense demeanor are compellingly intertwined with her actions, though her "steadily free" attribute could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the action of mollifying grief driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution leans slightly into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfulâ€”haunted dollhouse and post-memory world merge vividly. Sensory details (floorboards sighing, dust like moths) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lanterns as traditions, heartbeat sync) and lyrical prose create lasting impact. Theme of enduring humanity resonates, though the ending borders on didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length, and leaves a haunting aftertaste of resilience.</comment>
