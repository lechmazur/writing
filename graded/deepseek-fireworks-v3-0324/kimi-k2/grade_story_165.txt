<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's gentle yet unyielding nature is consistent and drives her actions effectively. Her motivation is clear, though her "joyful terror" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Trial of Echoes backstory feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and vivid, with striking sensory details. The underground city and garden’s ghost are richly evocative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors, though "joyful terror" treads close to cliché. The prose avoids AI pitfalls but occasionally overindulges in lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the dwarven elders' guilt resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
