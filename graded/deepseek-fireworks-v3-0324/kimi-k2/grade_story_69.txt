<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Roan's uncertainty and druidic background meld seamlessly with his motivations and actions, creating a distinct, layered character. His "uniquely common" guilt is palpable and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arcs elegantly from Roan's wanderings to his cathartic audition, with purposeful pacing and clear cause-effect logic. The tight word limit enhances focus.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The hologram repair shop and its fractured memories are vividly rendered, amplifying the story's themes. Sensory details (neon flicker, corroded circuits) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: holographic trees sprouting from the lunch tin symbolize redemption, and the ending resonates. Subtext about art and obligation elevates the narrative.</comment>
