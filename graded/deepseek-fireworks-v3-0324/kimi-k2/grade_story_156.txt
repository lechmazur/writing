<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra's confusion and diplomatic role are well-integrated, revealing depth through her internal conflict and symbolic interactions. However, her "boldly timid" heart could be more vividly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s coherence is strong, with the treaty rewrite as a logical climax. Pacing is tight but effective; the feather and birds subtly foreshadow the resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sodium walls, brine drips, and halite mirrors create a hauntingly vivid setting. The salt mine’s transformation into a village is richly evocative and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful storytelling with layered symbolism (feather, key, birds). The ending’s emotional and thematic payoff is profound, though the "counterpoint of hearts" phrasing slightly overreaches.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The salt mine’s duality and avian motifs feel fresh. Minor quibble: "evolutionary wisdom" could be more subtly woven into Lysandra’s realization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. Elements serve the story’s depth, not vice versa. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving a haunting meditation on memory and migration.</comment>
