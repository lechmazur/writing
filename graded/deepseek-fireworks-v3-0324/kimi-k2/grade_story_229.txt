<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and poetically rendered, but "mildly curious" feels understated for the emotional stakes. His actions and introspection, however, reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot is elegantly structured, with a resonant arc. The rain-as-map device is inventive, but the transition to the brigantine feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>World-building is masterful; the graveyard hums with atmosphere. Sensory details (rain, rust, light) immerse the reader without overwhelming.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exquisite literary craft, with layered symbolism and emotional resonance. Only nit: the ending's profundity slightly overshadows earlier subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Some metaphors ("liquid starlight") flirt with purple prose but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting gem. Elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lasting emotional echo.</comment>
