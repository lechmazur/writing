<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's socially awkward inventor persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. Her use of the wooden whistle aligns with her backstory and emotional arc, though her cynicism could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with logical cause-and-effect and a satisfying arc. The reversed trails method is inventive but slightly abrupt in execution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner and archive settings merge seamlessly with the tone. Sensory details (e.g., "sodium-lit parking lot") enhance atmosphere. The tree motif is deeply integrated into the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (whistle, tree) and subtext. The ending is resonant and thematically rich. Writing style elevates the story, showing rather than telling emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose. The narrative maintains a consistent, distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. Leaves a lingering impact. Creative combination of assigned elements.</comment>
