<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply human, her "confidently unsure" attribute and molten sarcasm enrich her voice, but her overworked trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect, though the climax’s revelation leans slightly on coincidence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gallery's decaying atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cracked kaleidoscope, dimming lights) amplifying the mood of grief and inevitability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (Queen of Spades, kaleidoscope) and subtext; the ending is hauntingly resonant, though the "molten sarcasm" tone occasionally overshadows nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and emotionally layered, avoiding clichés; the kaleidoscope memory device is fresh, but the detective archetype borders on familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth; the brevity feels artful, though the final reflection slightly over-explains.</comment>
