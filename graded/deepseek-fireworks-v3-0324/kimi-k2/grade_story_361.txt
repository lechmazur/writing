<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' transformation from trapper to knowledge guardian is compelling, though his "mild-mannered" trait could be more visibly integrated. His motivation is clear but slightly overshadowed by dense atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's cosmic-mundane duality is striking, but the dice's final message feels abrupt. Pacing balances well, though the schoolhouse's urgency could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic diner and indigenous symbolism merge brilliantly. Sensory details (hissing espresso, frybread) anchor the surreal, but the bulldozers lack visceral menace.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Layered metaphors (dice as compass, hearth as knowledge) elevate the prose. Ending resonates, though Orion's belt shift risks overloading the word limit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh twists on tropes (raven-circuitry tattoo) defy predictability. Some phrases ("dying star") edge toward clich√©, but subtext (cultural erasure) feels urgent and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole. The diner's fragility against bulldozers lingers, though the dice's mechanics could be more seamlessly woven.</comment>
