<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's internal conflict ("hatefully adored") is subtly revealed through actions and sensory details, though her backstory remains sparse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each instruction escalating tension and thematic resonance. Pacing is impeccable for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The submarine setting is viscerally evoked through pressure, sound, and bioluminescence, amplifying the story's claustrophobic mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (chopsticks as compass, plankton as fears) and layered subtext ("chaos is only order speaking too fast").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (whale songs as pulse, plankton as galaxies) avoid clich√©. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of assigned elements into a story that feels expansive despite its brevity. Lingers like a sonar echo.</comment>
