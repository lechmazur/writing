<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear, yet his "bizarrely typical" methods lend depth. His voice is distinct, though his solitude could be more emotionally explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight and coherent, with a satisfying arc. The feud's resolution via stamping the sky is inventive, though the chessboard metaphor feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exquisite—Neo-Kyoto’s fusion of futuristic and mystical details elevates the atmosphere. Sensory immersion (coffee steam, Morse-hoofed horses) is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamp as sun/mouth/zero) and layered themes (cosmic feud as mundane enchantment) resonate. The ending’s "listen" is hauntingly effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending futuristic and folkloric elements. Some phrases ("liquid eyes") edge toward cliché, but the core concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving the reader with a lingering question: is the feud real or a beautiful delusion?</comment>
