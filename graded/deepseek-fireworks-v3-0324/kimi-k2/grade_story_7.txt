<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's spiral structure mirrors the cane's distortion, achieving cohesion and a haunting resolution, though the "star paths" method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (opalescent dust, cold starlight) fuse the facility’s industrial grit with ethereal wonder, elevating the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh originality in blending carnival decay with liturgical solemnity, though the "chorus of healing" concept edges toward abstraction without enough grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A nearly flawless alchemy of assigned elements, with only the "star paths" feeling marginally forced. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lasting, luminous impression.</comment>
