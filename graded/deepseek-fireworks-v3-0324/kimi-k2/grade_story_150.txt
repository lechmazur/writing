<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calder's outlaw-cowboy-poet persona is vividly rendered, but his motivation—balancing anonymity and immortality—could be more deeply explored in the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is tight and purposeful, with the dice and dome’s synergy driving momentum, though the finale’s abruptness slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is immersive and richly detailed, with sensory language (brass ticking, steam hissing) elevating the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking literary devices (e.g., the dome as a "rehearsal" of fate) and a haunting ending compensate for minor pacing hiccups in this otherwise masterful craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of cowboy mythos and steampunk mysticism, though the "intertwined destinies" concept verges on overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story’s brevity feels intentional, with every element serving its thematic core. A lingering, furnace-like curiosity remains post-reading.</comment>
