<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira's late-blooming heroism is distinct and poignant, reflecting depth in her reluctance and grief. Her motivation—seeking cosmic balance through her brother’s spyglass—feels organic and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot’s brevity is masterfully handled, with a clear arc from loss to resolve. The spyglass's revelation of cosmic imbalance is a standout moment, though the ending could tighten slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The rooftop farm and ash sky create a vivid, immersive backdrop. Sensory details (rust, kale shivering) elevate the atmosphere, perfectly mirroring Mira’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors ("black petals of entropy") and symbolism (the spyglass as memory) resonate deeply. The ending’s quiet defiance lingers, though the theme could delve even darker.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, avoiding clichés. The prose is poetic yet precise, with fresh imagery (e.g., "green galaxies out of ruin"). Only minor overuse of "rust" as a motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, powerful microcosm of grief and resilience. The elements serve the story flawlessly, leaving a haunting impression of fragility versus persistence.</comment>
