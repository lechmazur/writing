<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and coherent, with a clear arc, though the shared taxi ride feels slightly contrived as a setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully evokedâ€”sensory details (rain, stalactites humming) and the harmonic caves create a vivid, immersive world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements blend seamlessly; the story feels deliberate and lingers. Creative use of "intelligently foolish" and "measured wildness."</comment>
