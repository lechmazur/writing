<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is compelling and her flawed righteousness adds depth. Her actions align with her mission, and her disguise as a teacher subtly enhances her role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect. The word limit is used efficiently, and the resolution feels earned, though the climax could be slightly more protracted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The bathhouse setting is vividly realized, with sensory details (steam, music, warmth) enhancing mood. The organ's reverberations and star-mosaics deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (phoenix, constellations) and layered themes (fear, courage) elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the boy's instant acceptance of Aurelia's alien nature feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with no clich√©s. The concept of hidden knowledge in human art is ingenious, though the "flawed but unashamed" conclusion edges toward predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
