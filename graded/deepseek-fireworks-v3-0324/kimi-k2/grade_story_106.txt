<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's sullen demeanor and farmer background are clear and consistent, shaping her actions and transformation. Her motivation to escape debt and barren fields is compelling and drives the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from despair to liberation. Pacing is excellent, and the quilt's transformation feels organic, not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The drowned power station and bioluminescent quilt create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt air, glowing patches) enhance the mood beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (stamps as borders, quilt as map) and poetic prose. The ending is deeply satisfying, with layered themes of escape and reinvention.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "stitched from cancelled journeys") are fresh, and the emotional resonance feels earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
