<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher's barefoot, stamp-clutching persona is vividly rendered, and his motivation—to bridge human connection through heartbreak—is clear and poignant. His actions align with his poetic, wandering nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly from arrival to collision, with the stamps and flash mob serving as organic pivots. The tight word limit is masterfully used to create a complete, resonant arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accelerator's sterile vastness contrasts beautifully with the warmth of human longing. Sensory details (chilled linoleum, stamp ink bleeding into pulse) immerse the reader in a liminal, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the stamps-as-rosary metaphor, the lullaby as "connection stretched thin," and the UV glow of particles spelling names all elevate the story. The ending lingers, bittersweet and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Startlingly original—no tropes here. The fusion of physics and poetry feels fresh, and the prose avoids cliché while remaining precise (e.g., "dread like the moment before a letter is opened").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element feels deliberate and cohesive. The brevity enhances the story's ephemeral beauty, leaving the reader with a hum of connection and the ache of transience.</comment>
