<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear, nuanced, and drives her actions without being overly explained. Her "disinterested passion" and poetic defiance of fate are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is taut, with each detail advancing the plot. Cause-and-effect is seamless, and the ending resolves while leaving thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The menagerie is vividly rendered with sensory richness (nutmeg smoke, embedded eyes). Atmosphere heightens the tension between captivity and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the narrative. The final stanza ("Fate expects curtains...") crystallizes theme and character in a stunning, memorable climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and subversion of tropes (e.g., the Cup refilling with ink, not desire). No clichés; metaphors feel fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s cohesion. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about fate’s performative nature.</comment>
