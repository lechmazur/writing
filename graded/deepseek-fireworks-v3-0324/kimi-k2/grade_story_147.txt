<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's "earnestly naive" attribute is well-integrated and drives her actions believably, though her motivation to "map ancient wisdom" could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and cohesive, with a clear arc and satisfying resolution. The recursive twist elevates it beyond the word limit's constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisitely atmospheric—sensory details like "sawdust and rusted music" and the puppet workshop's eerie stillness immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and subtext (e.g., the Möbius strip routes, recursion as curse). The ending lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The wind chime melody as language and the puppet master's absence are particularly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished gem. Every element serves the story, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
