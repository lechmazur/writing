<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the tea-leaf analysis serving as a clever pivot, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine is vividly rendered, with sensory details (crimson paint, kraken-shaped kettle) deepening the atmosphere. The paint-drying timeframe is oddly compelling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("hope tilting like the submarine") and a distinct voice avoid AI pitfalls. The melancholy jester trope is subverted by his ritualistic role.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The storyâ€™s brevity feels intentional, with each element serving the theme of reclaimed joy. Leaves a lingering warmth.</comment>
