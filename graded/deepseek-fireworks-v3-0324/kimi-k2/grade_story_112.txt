<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and compelling, with nuanced reactions to objects and setting. Her "factually imaginative" attribute subtly enriches her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive and purpose-driven, with a satisfying arc. The hopscotch-to-recipe translation is inventive but slightly rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details and atmosphere—cedar, incense, snow—immerse the reader. The archive’s mausoleum-like quality enhances the theme of preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice, no clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "seeds of vigilance") are fresh, and prose avoids excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story’s theme elegantly. Brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
