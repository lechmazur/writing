<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysandra's transformation and motivation are vividly portrayed, with her seasickness and charm revealing depth. Her actions align well with her established traits, though a touch more nuance in her internal conflict would elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with moon phases and transformation driving the narrative coherently. The resolution feels earned, though the middle could briefly clarify the mirror's significance earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and ghost orchids create a lush, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "pulse" of the stone and "liquid silver" moonlight are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (mirror, orchids) and subtext about self-deception. The ending is poignant, and the prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity. A rare balance of elegance and impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The ghost orchid as a metaphor for traded secrets feels fresh, and the tone avoids melodrama. Only minor tightening of phrasing would perfect it.</comment>
