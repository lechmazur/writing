<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage's enigmatic presence and shifting motivations are compelling, though his internal logic could be slightly sharper. The boy’s role is poignant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot unfolds with lyrical precision, though the mirror-reflection device verges on overused. The ending's surrender is masterfully understated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse is rendered with haunting luminosity, and the interplay of frost/pollen elevates the atmosphere to near-perfection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite symbolism and thematic depth, though the "sanctified dread" tone occasionally clashes with the story’s softer revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startlingly original; the coffin fragment’s agency and the time-folded frontier defy tropes. Only a few phrases verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless balance of restraint and audacity. The length feels intentional, and the ending lingers like frost melting.</comment>
