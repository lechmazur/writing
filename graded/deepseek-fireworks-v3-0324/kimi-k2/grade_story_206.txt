<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lumière's motivation is vividly clear, her vendetta rooted in personal tragedy. Her precise creativity and hidden kindness add depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct in first-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is tightly woven, with Lumière's counterattack evolving organically into revelation. Pacing is strong, though the portal's sudden introduction slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market and hidden continent are evoked with lush sensory detail. The sugar-as-weapon motif and crystalline shores reinforce theme and tone brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (sugar as both weapon and healing) and subtext (rage vs. hope). The ending's thematic resonance—vendetta dissolving into bridges—is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the sugar-crafted rebellion and hidden continent. Minimal cliché, though "ardent scorn" risks over-formality. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, lyrical whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving haunting imagery (sugar wings, caramel rain) that lingers beyond the narrative.</comment>
