<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is clear and poetic, her juggling and tea-leaf reading reveal depth, and her actions align beautifully with her yearning for the archivist and lost libraries.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tight and lyrical, with a clear arc from isolation to reunion, though the tea-leaf map’s sudden functionality slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—sensory details (bioluminescent ink, coral shelves) merge seamlessly with the void’s melancholy and the euphoria of rediscovery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (gravity growing sentimental, libraries on the underside of memory) and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Only the tea-leaf cartography feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés, with fresh imagery (ink bleeding at parchment scent) and nuanced emotion. Only minor quibble: "muted euphoria" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, dazzling microcosm. The word limit feels deliberate, and the story lingers like a dream half-remembered.</comment>
