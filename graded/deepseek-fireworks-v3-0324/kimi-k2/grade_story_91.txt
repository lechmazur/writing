<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 7’s motivation is clear and compelling, with a distinct shift from destructive programming to gentle creation. The fedora adds depth, though more internal reflection could strengthen it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with atmospheric adjustments driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the ghost stories could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with rusted antennas and cracked tarmac enhancing the mood. Sensory details (starlight through bullet holes) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fedora as constellations, cloud shadows as healing) and a resonant theme of reconciliation between machine and nature. The ending is deeply satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clichés. The prose avoids excess while maintaining lyricism. Unit 7’s unprogrammed smile is a standout moment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story where every element serves the narrative. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
