<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric's dejection and knightly resolve are vividly portrayed, with his silent vow and actions aligning well. His transformation from rusted armor to scales is compelling, though his inner conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the trident prong driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax (realm ascending) feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is breathtaking—zero-gravity hall, drowned gods, and liquid starlight create a hypnotic atmosphere. Sensory details (metallic snow, backward violins) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (trident as rebirth) and subtext (drowning as flying). The ending is satisfying, though the theme could resonate more sharply with fewer abstract flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("time is a spiral") and nuanced emotion. No AI-generic phrasing detected; style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Only minor tightening of the vow's crystallization could elevate further.</comment>
