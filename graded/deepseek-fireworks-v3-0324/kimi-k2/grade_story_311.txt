<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's tension and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his internal conflict and external actions tightly aligned. The photograph serves as a powerful anchor for his backstory and drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a clear arc from restraint to rebellion. The code phrase and escape are logical payoffs to the seeded fragments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is immersive and thematically resonant, with "serene anger" in the plants mirroring Kael's struggle. Sensory details (e.g., frayed photograph, humming leaves) deepen the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft: the metaphor of roots aching for Earth’s pulse, the layered theme of rebellion, and the hauntingly satisfying ending. Shows rather than tells emotion masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "stories scratch against the photograph") and nuanced handling of defiance and hope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. Elements serve the narrative seamlessly, leaving a lingering question about resistance and renewal. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
