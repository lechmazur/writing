<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undertaker is vividly portrayed with clear motivation—his grief and vow to prevent another loss drive his actions. His "placid ferocity" is consistent and compelling, revealing depth in his quiet determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is taut and purposeful, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The astronomical clock's mechanics and the imprisoning of death are logically integrated, though the sun-path method could be clarified slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the palace's decay and moonlit tension amplify the story's mood. Sensory details (dust, gears, shadows) immerse the reader, and the setting feels inseparable from the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb craftsmanship. Literary devices (metaphors like "shadows lengthened like black vines") enrich the narrative. The ending is hauntingly resonant, balancing hope and inevitable consequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. The premise avoids clichés, and the prose is evocative without being florid. Emotional nuance (e.g., the child's laugh juxtaposed with his tear) feels deeply human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity serves the story's intensity, and the astronomical clock's role is both inventive and thematically vital. Lingers long after reading.</comment>
