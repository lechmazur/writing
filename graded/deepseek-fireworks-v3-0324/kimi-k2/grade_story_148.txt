<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's desert-scarred past and storm-chasing history are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, though her transition to carousel restoration could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the carousel's restoration serving as a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the brass spill resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and carousel are vividly rendered, with sensory details (snow, molten brass) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply supports the theme of transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tongs as compass, carousel as prayer wheel) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the theme of "circling home" borders on overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "brass gears flashing like sunlit hail"). Minor reliance on nostalgia as a motif, but avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and motion.</comment>
