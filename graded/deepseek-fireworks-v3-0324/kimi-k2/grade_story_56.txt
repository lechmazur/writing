<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's cause-and-effect is tight, with the orchard's symbolism and the computer's restart driving the swindler's revelation organically. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is breathtakingly original, with sensory details (bruised apples, wet concrete) amplifying the mood. The skyscraper-orchard juxtaposition elevates the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the blank price tag as symbolism, the whispering ghosts as subtext, and the ending's quiet resolve. Every device serves the narrative's emotional heft.</comment>
