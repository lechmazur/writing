<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Mara Voss is well-developed with clear, consistent motivation; her dual role and past trauma enrich her actions. Her "voice" is distinct, blending playfulness and sorrow effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete despite brevity. No rushed or abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are immersive and evocative. Broken mirrors and autumn leaves enhance mood and action. Sensory details (soot, rustling leaves) deepen the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is masterful, with rich symbolism (moss as restoration, mirrors as time). Emotional resonance is strong, and the ending is purposeful and layered. Theme of redemption is clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. No clich√©s; metaphors (candle wick as fingerprint) are fresh. Emotional nuance and stylistic consistency elevate it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. Creative combination (moss + Mirror-Eater) lingers in the mind. Feels expansive, not constrained by length.</comment>
