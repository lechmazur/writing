<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's "ruthless" nature isn't fully explored, but "intellectually spontaneous" shines through actions and dialogue. Comb backstory adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot feels dreamlike but coherent, though the road trip device is underutilized. Pacing balances mysticism and momentum well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stone circle and singer's pauses create a haunting, liminal atmosphere. Lichen, moss, and glyphs are vividly sensory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh turns of phrase ("polite anarchy humming in her pulse") counter occasional AI-esque abstraction ("lunar scars").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a mystical whole. The combâ€™s ransom and final glyph sentence suggest deliberate craftsmanship.</comment>
