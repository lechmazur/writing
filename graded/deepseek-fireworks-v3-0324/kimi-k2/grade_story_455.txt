<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized, his silence and scars forming a resonant, human complexity. His motivation—confronting ghosts—feels organic to his war-torn past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s surreal yet cohesive arc, from coins to sinking, balances brevity with satisfying closure. Pacing is deliberate, though the well’s leap risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful: the well’s throat, shadow patterns, and water’s memory merge into a haunting, tactile world. Sensory details (clinking coins, moss-slick stone) anchor the ethereal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Profoundly evocative—symbolism (coins as scars, water as confessional), layered subtext, and a devastating yet fitting ending. Literary craft elevates every sentence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original. No clichés; metaphors (e.g., "silhouette a syllable") and emotional nuance feel authentically human. Style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion. Elements serve the story’s depth, not vice versa. Lingers like a whispered secret—proof of artistry, not constraint.</comment>
