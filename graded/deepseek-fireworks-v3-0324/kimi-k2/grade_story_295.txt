<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kestrel's jovial exterior contrasts effectively with his internal struggle, and his motivation to "dethrone doubt" is clear, though slightly underdeveloped in places.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from reluctance to resolution. The telescopic reveal is well-paced and thematically satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The garden's transformation and sensory details (hissing moonflowers, screaming basil) create a vivid, haunting atmosphere that elevates the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism (rosemary as a vow, telescope as self-reflection) and a resonant ending. The prose is lush but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("doubt crept like bindweed") and subverted tropes (the witch's helpfulness, the "treasure" being self-knowledge) demonstrate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly; the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and thematic depth.</comment>
