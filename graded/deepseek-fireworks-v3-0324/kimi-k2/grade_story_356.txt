<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's wry caretaker persona is vividly rendered, and her motivation to escape regret is clear, though her aloofness slightly distances emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The spiral-to-vanish structure is elegant and coherent, with tight cause-and-effect. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the phone's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold and nebulae are flawlessly integrated, with sensory details (ozone, chalk dust) amplifying the melancholy atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft—symbolism (chalk, spiral), subtext (regret as "time's mask"), and a hauntingly purposeful ending elevate this beyond most flash fiction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("siren singing 'what if'"). No clichés; emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm: every element serves the theme of erasure, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache.</comment>
