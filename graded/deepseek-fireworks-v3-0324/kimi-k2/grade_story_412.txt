<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cyclical nightmares and the key cover serving as effective anchors. The pacing is deliberate, and the arc feels complete despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frequency monitoring station and its humming atmosphere are immersive and enhance the story's eerie, introspective mood. Sensory details (gunpowder, rain) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent metaphors ("rosary of guilt") and layered subtext. The ending is both satisfying and open-ended, leaving a lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
