<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and nuanced, with the monk's haunted past and silent resolve effectively driving the narrative. His distinct voice and subtle emotional depth stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly wound, with a logical arc and evocative cause-and-effect. The brevity feels intentional, though the cosmic event's resolution could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and poetic, with sensory details (grinding gears, sticky melodies) enriching the atmosphere. The shop's surrealism complements the monk's journey perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (key, melodies) and subtext. The ending is hauntingly purposeful, and the prose elevates the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. Fresh metaphors ("honey laced with arsenic") and nuanced emotion showcase a distinct authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the silence left behind lingers with the reader.</comment>
