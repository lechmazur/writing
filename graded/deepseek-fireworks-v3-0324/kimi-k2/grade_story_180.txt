<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the fingerprint-matching method driving the narrative elegantly. The ending resolves the conjurer's arc while leaving room for cyclical rediscovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite craftsmanship: metaphors (calcified remorse, knitting light) and subtext (self-loathing as ballast) elevate the story. The ending lingers with poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The coral-eared woman and unraveling guilt feel fresh. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told, and the voice is distinct.</comment>
