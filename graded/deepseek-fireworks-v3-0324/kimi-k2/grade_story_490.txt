<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The caretaker's fading existence and paradoxical actions (e.g., lavender as futile repair) reveal depth. His star-shaped pupils and backward heartbeats subtly underscore his irreversible transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's descent into cosmic dissolution feels inevitable yet surprising. The lavender-to-light transition is abrupt but thematically justified. Minor pacing wobbles near the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Salt-stained skies, obsidian gears, and humming sand create a tactile, dying world. The station’s "rusty ribcage" imagery is particularly masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lavender as both fuse and offering, the terminal’s "guilty secrets"—every symbol lands. The ending’s metamorphosis into cartography is hauntingly original.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No clichés here. "Enthusiastic apathy" and "liquid constellations" are fresh. The caretaker’s dissolution avoids typical transcendence tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the elegiac, cosmic-horror-tinged mood. The brevity feels deliberate, the imagery potent enough to linger.</comment>
