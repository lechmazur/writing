<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is intriguingly ambiguous, but her connection to the spoon and the mountain's lore feels organic and deeply personal.

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (spoon, murals) and layered metaphors. The ending is both satisfying and open-ended, with a clear theme of inherited chaos. The prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
