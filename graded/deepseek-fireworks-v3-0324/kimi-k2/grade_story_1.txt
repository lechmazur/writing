<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's phobia and stunt double background are vividly integrated into her actions and reactions, revealing depth and consistency. Her motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" is clear and compelling, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with unraveling the net driving the story forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the arc feels complete, though the garage sales timeframe slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (salt, mildew, barnacled light) enhancing mood. The pyramid library and net are meaningfully connected to Mara's journey, though the garage sales feel tangential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (net as fear, envelope as surrender) and evocative prose. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the theme of confronting fear resonates deeply. Style elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (mundanely spiritual holiness from shipwrecks) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI tropes, though "numb fascination" slightly leans toward stated feeling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, with creative combinations (net as fear map, envelope as parachute). The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
