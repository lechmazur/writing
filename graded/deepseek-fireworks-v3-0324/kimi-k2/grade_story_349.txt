<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drone pilot's "cynically hopeful" nature is vividly portrayed and drives his actions, though his background could be slightly more fleshed out for full clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc from despair to tentative hope. The speed dating event is a unique and effective vehicle for the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World and atmosphere are exceptionalâ€”sensory details (scorched dome, herb bundle's scent) and the clash of modern/fantasy elements create immersive depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext, evocative symbolism (herb smoke as a drone), and a hauntingly purposeful ending elevate this beyond surface narrative. Minor pacing quibbles near the midpoint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic voice with fresh metaphors ("bet his last battery on a miracle"). Only slight over-reliance on "charred" imagery detracts marginally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly, leaving a lingering sense of fragile hope. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
