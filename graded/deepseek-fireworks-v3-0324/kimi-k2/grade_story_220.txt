<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The page's transformation from aloof to self-aware is compelling. His motivation—reclaiming power through curiosity—is clear but occasionally overshadowed by atmospheric details.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action (e.g., the delay, the meeting) driving toward resolution. The ending feels earned, though the periscope reveal borders on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (rust, neon, fogged visor) enriching the wounded season. The atmosphere perfectly mirrors the theme of buried memories.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (logbook, paper boats) is deftly handled, and the prose is lyrical without excess. The ending’s thematic punch ("Power is the story you choose to carry") lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Remarkably original, avoiding tropes. The diving helmet and sea-fern logbook are fresh, and the prose balances poetic precision with emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant gem. The brevity amplifies its impact, and every element feels deliberate. Leaves the reader haunted by its exploration of memory and agency.</comment>
