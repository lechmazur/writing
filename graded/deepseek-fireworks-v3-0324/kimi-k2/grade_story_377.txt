<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cache’s motivation is clear and poetic, his yearning for a world beyond the screen is compelling, and his actions align beautifully with his silent, expressive nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and elegantly structured, with a satisfying arc. Pacing is tight but not rushed, and the cause-and-effect logic of Cache’s integration feels organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details (salt air, powdered sugar, ozone). The library’s hidden magic and the block party’s chaos contrast perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (barometer as compass, seismograph as scribe) elevates the prose. The ending is hauntingly resonant, and the theme of release lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("graphite prayers," "ghost of polygons"). Emotion is shown, not told, and the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a palpable ache for the unreal.</comment>
