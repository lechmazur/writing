<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ludo's motivation is clear and poetically rendered, though his "relaxed" nature could be more dynamically tested.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly, with the musical notes and lens serving as organic guides. Pacing is masterful for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("teacup’s handle and the moon’s echo") and a distinct voice. Only minor over-reliance on "syrupy" descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, though the mansion's humming finale borders on whimsy overkill.</comment>
