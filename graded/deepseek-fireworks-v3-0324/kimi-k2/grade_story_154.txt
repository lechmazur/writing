<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong, nuanced portrayal of the courier's motivation and internal conflict; "strongly weak" is a compelling paradox. Character voice is distinct through actions and reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive with a clear arc; ink pot’s role as both object and symbol drives the narrative effectively. Pacing is tight but not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Celtic village setting is vividly realized; sensory details (smoke as question marks, woad-blue paint) deepen immersion. Atmosphere perfectly aligns with tone and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (levitating ink, courage as "strands"); ending is resonant and thematically rich. Subtext about change and permanence elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh imagery (e.g., "hearts crossing oceans without leaving home"). No clichés; emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated; brevity feels intentional. Story lingers with thematic depth and emotional weight.</comment>
