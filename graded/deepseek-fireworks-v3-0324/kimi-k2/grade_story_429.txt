<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eira's earthy farmer background subtly informs her connection to land and tradition. Her motivation to restore recordings and honor ancestors is clear but nuanced, revealed through action rather than exposition. The "effectively unique" attribute feels organic, shaping her ritual.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot achieves remarkable coherence within constraints. The scale ritual progresses logically, and the auroral "folding" frames the action elegantly. Pacing is deliberate but not sluggish. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in the resolution.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion. The platform and aurora are vividly rendered, with sensory details (frosted railing, cloudberry scent) deepening the mood. The setting actively participates in the climax—lights "folding" mirrors Eira's internal reckoning.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered. The scale's symbolism (weighing past/present) resonates, and the ancestral voices' release is deeply moving. Subtext about cultural preservation elevates the narrative. Ending is transcendent without being overly tidy.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking originality. The fusion of vinyl recordings, folk ritual, and celestial phenomena feels fresh. Metaphors ("chains like ice cracking") are precise. No clichés; emotions are shown through tactile details (crystallizing tears).</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A near-perfect microcosm. Elements serve the story’s emotional core rather than feeling imposed. The brevity amplifies its mythic quality. Lingers in the mind—especially the image of pans becoming stars.</comment>
