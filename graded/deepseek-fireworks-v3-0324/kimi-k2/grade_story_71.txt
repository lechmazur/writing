<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patchwork's fervent apathy is a compelling paradox, though its lack of emotional capacity risks distancing the reader. The oath and virtual encounters deepen its tragic resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's spiral structure mirrors the thematic recursion. Tight cause-and-effect, though the VR interludes could disorient if not for the clear anchor of the oath.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The fossilized giant's ribcage is a masterstrokeâ€”gothic yet organic. Glowing lines, ash storms, and skeletal cathedrals evoke a mythic density.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (fan as map, tears as fate) elevates the narrative. The ending's revelation of shared identity is haunting, though the emotional pivot feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of folk horror and metaphysical SF. "Fervent apathy" and the giant's dual roles defy tropes. Some phrases verge on over-poetic ("wheat and regret").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A rare instance where constrained elements feel inevitable. The child's vision lingers, though the final line's hopeful note clashes with prior nihilism.</comment>
