<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's character is deeply nuanced, with clear, layered motivations. His internal conflict between duty and desire is compelling and drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The pacing is excellent, and the action (contaminating timelines) is both logical and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The capsule hotel and temporal static create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (the coil's warmth, the hum of static) heighten the story's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The story is masterfully crafted, with rich symbolism (the coil as both anchor and recorder) and a hauntingly beautiful ending. The theme of stories as living entities is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original and authentic. The handling of time travel feels fresh, and the emotional resonance is earned through subtle, evocative proseâ€”not stated emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>A flawless, cohesive gem. Every element serves the narrative, and the brevity amplifies its impact. Lingers far beyond the final line.</comment>
