<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garrick's surliness is well-balanced with depth; his curiosity and cosmic yearning elevate him beyond a trope. The yarn's symbolism ties his past to his present arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from mystery to resolution. The merchant's arrival and knot divination method feel earned, not contrived. Pacing is tight yet lyrical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The graveyard is a masterclass in atmosphere—ghostly tides, broken rigging chimes, and salt-stung stars coalesce into a visceral, haunting world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite prose with layered metaphors (e.g., "grief became compass"). The ending resonates; Garrick’s transformation into a keeper-of-questions is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Defies clichés with fresh imagery (barnacle-scrawled epitaphs) and emotional nuance. The "serenely frantic" paradox feels uniquely human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect fusion of elements. The yarn, graveyard, and riddles serve the theme of cosmic attention rather than feeling imposed. Lingers beautifully.</comment>
