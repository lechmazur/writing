<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and poetic, blending inherited dreams with a rebellious streak. His actions align with his "empirically rebellious" nature, but his background as a noble feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly coherent, with a clear arc from Alaric's first chalked message to the garden's transformation. Pacing is tight yet immersive, though the climax (his vanishing) could be more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with glass bells and frost-script creating a hypnotic atmosphere. Sensory details (chalk scrapes, humming graffiti) elevate the setting to near-mythic status.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors (chalk as a "scepter," equations curling into birds) and layered subtext (madness vs. logic) make this unforgettable. The ending lingers with haunting beauty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, avoiding clichés. The "cosmic dance" theme feels fresh, though "handed-down stories" occasionally slip into vague mysticism. Language is lush but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A nearly flawless fusion of elements. The brevity enhances its mythic quality, and the story’s depth rewards rereading. Only minor quibbles (noble identity, abrupt vanishing) hold it back from perfection.</comment>
