<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's "ingeniously clueless" trait is vividly portrayed, driving her actions with a paradoxical clarity. Her motivation (the riddle) is compelling but could benefit from deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic and cause-effect relationships are expertly handled, though the tight word limit forces some transitions to feel abrupt. The resolution is satisfyingly circular.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with the roller coaster and haunted inns fused into a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rust, pulsing brass) elevate the uncanny mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (the doorknob, eroding ink) and thematic depth (questioning as the riddle itself). The ending lingers with poetic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s through fresh metaphors (e.g., "linens folded into origami swans"). The "quiet mania" tone is distinct, though slightly over-relied on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. The elements serve the story's eerie elegance, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
