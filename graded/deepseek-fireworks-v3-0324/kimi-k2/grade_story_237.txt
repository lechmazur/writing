<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her psychic abilities and the dice. Her "proudly humble" demeanor and "grave playfulness" create a distinct voice. Her actions align with her desire to reshape sorrow into sweetness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, with the dice roll and diary revelations driving the narrative forward. The pacing is effective, though the bullet train diaries could feel slightly abrupt in this word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exquisite, blending the cold brig with the ephemeral beauty of abandoned trains and starlight. Sensory details (rust, jasmine, comet-like tears) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (metaphors, symbolism) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, weaving destiny into a tactile act of dice-rolling. Emotional resonance is high, and the theme of rewriting fate is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The combination of psychic genealogy, cosmic bullet trains, and dice as destiny-tools feels fresh. Nuanced emotions and stylistic flair elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact—destiny as a mutable, collaborative act.</comment>
