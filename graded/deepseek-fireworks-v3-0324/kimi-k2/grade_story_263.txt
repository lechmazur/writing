<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is compellingly complex, blending zealotry with tragic self-delusion, though his 'voice' could be sharper in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly woven, but the reversed echo device slightly strains logic in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prismal is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent judgment and moral eels elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (e.g., the octopus as confessor) deepen the narrative, though the ending’s resolution feels mildly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—subverts tropes (e.g., assassin-as-tragic-hero) with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotional layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The elements coalesce masterfully; the brief length amplifies the story’s mythic quality rather than limiting it.</comment>
