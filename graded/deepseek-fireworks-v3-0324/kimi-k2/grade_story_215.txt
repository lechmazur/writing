<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sister Marisol's complex duality as a rattled exorcist and scientist is vividly portrayed, with her guarded disclosures and coy aggression revealing depth. Her motivation to entwine science with wonder is clear and drives the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each puzzle logically unlocking the next revelation. Pacing is superb for the word limit, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is evoked with rich sensory details (rosary clacking, phosphorescent ichor). The ballroom's mirrored studio and sepia postcard deepen the atmosphere of eerie synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (metronome as rosary, spectral dancers) and subtext (faith vs. science). The ending is poignant, with the exorcist "keeping perfect time between wonder and proof."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of dance, science, and the supernatural feels fresh. Nuanced emotional resonance and stylistic precision elevate it beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce brilliantly. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering meditation on synthesis. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
