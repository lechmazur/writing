<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and deeply woven into the narrative, with the apothecary's exile and defiance of empires driving her actions. Her voice is distinct, though more internal monologue could deepen her perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with cause-and-effect relationships (infection, rebellion, pursuit) flowing logically. The ending resolves the central tension while leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional—steampunk submarine and butterfly spores create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hissing steam, oxidized copper) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors like "living constellations") are masterful. The story's thematic depth—exile, defiance, fragile hope—lingers long after reading. Subtext is rich, though the ending slightly overtells its message.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strikingly original, with no clichés. The highlighter pen as a relic and spores as "altered breath" are fresh, specific choices. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated (e.g., the engineer's unmasking).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, with each detail serving the story’s core. Leaves the reader haunted by its themes of exile and defiance.</comment>
