<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to their role as a plant whisperer, but their 'undercover' aspect feels underexplored. The vine's interactions reveal much about the protagonist's empathy and internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured around the vine's sacrifice, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the 'thought experiment' framing slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is lush and immersive, blending mechanics and biology seamlessly. Sensory details (chlorophyll secrets, frayed shoelace) deepen the atmosphere. Workshop and vine feel intrinsically connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor (violin string breaking, origami time) elevates the prose. Ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Subtext about sacrifice and listening is deftly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh imagery. No clich√©s; even 'test of faith' is subverted. Emotional nuance in the vine's sacrifice avoids sentimentality. Language is ornate but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, memorable whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. Combines biology/mechanics with startling ingenuity.</comment>
