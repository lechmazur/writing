<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's ambition and herbalist background are well-integrated into her motivations and actions. The clothespin and moonwort usage reveal her resourcefulness and emotional depth, though her internal conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect logic. The storm and tunnel collapse serve as effective pivots, and the resolution feels earned within the word limit. Pacing is strong, though the escape might benefit from a tad more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bunker's oppressive atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (fluorescent dread, poppies' silent screams) enhancing mood. The clothespin's connection to Mara's past enriches the setting's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (moonwort as regeneration, clothespin as silence/agency). The ending is resonant, and the theme of "enough" is explored with lyrical subtlety. Literary craft elevates the narrative beyond its surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "silver leaves unfolded like quiet wings"). Avoids clich√©s and formulaic phrasing. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, through evocative details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative combination of assigned elements without forced inclusion.</comment>
