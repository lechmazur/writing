<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation and eccentricity are vividly portrayed, with her actions and dialogue revealing a complex, rebellious character. Her distinct voice and refusal to conform are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with pruning as a metaphor for rebellion driving the narrative. The ending feels purposeful, though the word limit slightly rushes the apprentices' transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The orchard and solar panels create a rich, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors Lira's struggle. Sensory details (e.g., "glowed with stored sun") deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (grafting, disclaimers) and subtext. The ending lingers, challenging notions of leadership and fate. Writing style elevates the themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors ("pruning her own future") feel fresh. Tone and style are consistent, with nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements weave cohesively into a resonant whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on leadership and resistance.</comment>
