<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cynic’s motivation and voice are sharply defined; his curse and mission create compelling tension. The guard’s transformation is subtle but resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with clear cause/effect; the moon’s phases and tapestry shifts drive momentum without feeling rushed. Minor pacing dip in guard’s realization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hauntingly vivid atmosphere; the park’s decay and moon’s light are masterfully evoked. Birds and stillness amplify the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (sparrow, moon), poetic prose, and a resonant ending. Only flaw is a slight over-reliance on "petrify" as a motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original; avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., "lacquer cracked like old laughter"). Nuanced emotions and stylistic distinctness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the story feels deliberate, not constrained. Lingers with thematic weight ("Evolution is the only honest miracle").</comment>
