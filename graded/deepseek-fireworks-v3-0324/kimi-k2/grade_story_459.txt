<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, her "elegantly clumsy" attribute and ghost-seeing ability deeply influence her actions and voice, revealing a nuanced character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical arc from Mara's haunting to her liberation; pacing is excellent for the word count, though the ghost tour subplot feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab's eerie atmosphere is masterfully rendered with sensory details (silence, crumbling sand), and the setting enhances both the character's turmoil and the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flower crown, sand fractures) and subtext; the ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the prose elevates the emotional impact without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("silence pressed like glass"), originality in blending the mundane (elevators) with the supernatural, and nuanced handling of grief avoid clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich story that lingers; the elements serve the narrative, and the brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
