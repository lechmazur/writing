<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The guide's motivation is clear and her "accidentally heroic" attribute subtly shapes her actions. Her voice is distinct, though her internal conflict could be slightly deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly cohesive with a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the hotel's reappearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details (cedar, salt light) and the seashell cathedral create a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (puzzle box as destiny) and poetic prose elevate the story. Ending is satisfying, though the "calm fury" transition could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original—reversed wishes and architectural prophecy avoid clichés. Minor quibble: "sharp gentleness" slightly over-stylized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements mesh seamlessly; the seashell and prophecy feel inevitable, not forced. Leaves a lingering existential weight.</comment>
