<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cass's duality as a gentle brawler is compelling, and his motivation to chronicle social changes is clear, though his shift to witnessing feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the spice box's transformative role could be more seamlessly integrated with the opening conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive; the echo chamber and spice box create a haunting, sensory-driven world. Minor inconsistency in the transition from fighting to spice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—evocative metaphors, layered subtext, and a resonant ending. "Soul's revelation" theme slightly overshadows the social chronicle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery. Minimal cliché, though "thunderstorm" scent and "bruised sound" verge on overused poetic shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the story feels deliberate and complete. Motorcycle detour could be tighter, but the spice box payoff justifies it.</comment>
