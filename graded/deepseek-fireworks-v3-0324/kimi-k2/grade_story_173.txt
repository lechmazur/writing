<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist's motivation is clear and poetic, but his backstory feels slightly abstract, relying on multiverse implications rather than grounded personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's dreamlike logic is cohesive, though the tight word count obscures some cause-and-effect transitions. The ending resolves elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—sensory details (salt, apple, silt) merge with the surreal setting to create haunting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (leaves as maps, phantom guidance) and layered themes (memory, debt) elevate this beyond mere description. A few phrases verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Startlingly original voice and fresh metaphors ("moons of glass," "sorrow as currency"). Avoids clichés but risks opacity in its lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A nearly flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, though the multiverse scope begs expansion.</comment>
