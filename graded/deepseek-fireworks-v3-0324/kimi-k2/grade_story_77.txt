<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's introverted empathy is vividly portrayed, his sensitivity to others' emotions driving his actions. His motivation to champion the outcasts is clear and consistent, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the marionette's reassembly drives the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the pirates' abandonment could be fleshed out slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout and drowsy enthusiasm create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (starfish dust, humming fragments) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (marionette as shattered minds, starfish as salt blessing) and a resonant theme ("refusing to let the world flatten your peaks") elevate the story. The ending is deeply satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (nebulae as summits) and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though "drowsy enthusiasm" occasionally feels overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements that leaves a lingering impact. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme of resilience shines.</comment>
