<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation as a lost heiress is clear, but her transition to xenobiologist could be more developed. Her "bitterly optimistic" nature is compelling but occasionally overshadows deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spiral anomaly and parking stub serving as strong catalysts. Pacing is excellent, though the detour feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The xenobiology station and fractured sky create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the glowing parking stub elevate the scene.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (clouds as communication, parking stub as talisman) and emotional resonance. The ending's thematic payoff is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with minimal clich√©s. The fragmented reality concept is handled inventively, though the "lost heiress" trope risks predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by word count, and leaves a haunting impression.</comment>
