<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Juno's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her intellectual playfulness and feisty nature. Her actions—salvaging the lamp, teaching the foal—align perfectly with her goal of preserving ancient methods. Her distinct voice shines through the narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the morphing lamp driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent, and the story achieves a full arc—beginning with Juno’s discovery, climaxing with the carousel’s magic, and resolving with her redemptive acts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, blending the sterile emptiness of space with the warmth of Earth's nostalgia. Sensory details—brass warmth, comet-tail manes, hay scent—immerse the reader fully. The setting enhances both the action and Juno’s motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (symbolism of the lamp, metaphor of the carousel), the story evokes wonder and reflection. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, with a clear theme of redemption through small, stubborn acts. Show-don’t-tell is masterfully executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The fusion of sci-fi and fantasy feels fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "legs trembling like new constellations") are vivid. Emotion is nuanced, conveyed through action and atmosphere rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, with no wasted words. The lingering thought—redemption as small lights in darkness—is resonant. Creative and polished.</comment>
