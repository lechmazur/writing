<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sir Regret's contrition and motivation are vividly portrayed, with his internal conflict (kindness vs. violence) driving his actions consistently. His "voice" is distinct, especially in dialogue and reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc (mission, investigation, climax, resolution). Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the towel boy reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional: the floating island spa is immersive, with sensory details (eucalyptus, steam valves) enhancing the whimsical yet tense atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich use of metaphor (tattoos as betrayal) and symbolism (cracked monocle). Ending is satisfying, with thematic depth on kindness and self-forgiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, subverting tropes (e.g., the pretender's identity). Language is fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Leaves a lingering reflection on redemption. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
