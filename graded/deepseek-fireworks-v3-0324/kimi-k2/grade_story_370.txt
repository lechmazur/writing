<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict and transformation are vividly portrayed, though her passive nature could be more actively challenged earlier to heighten impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's circular structure is elegant, leveraging quantum foam's temporal elasticity to resolve Mira's arc cohesively within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Quantum foam as a setting is masterfully evoked—both ethereal and tactile, with sensory details (sepia pages, dust devils) grounding the speculative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (comic as sacred text, dance as rebellion) and layered subtext elevate this beyond surface narrative. Ending resonates with earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of quantum physics and ancestral memory avoids cliché. Minor over-reliance on "whispered possibilities" diminishes freshness slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a singular vision. Word limit feels deliberate, leaving room for reader interpretation without sacrificing depth.</comment>
