<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lysander’s motivation is sharply defined—his exile, disgrace, and obsession with truth are compelling. The hummingbird drone and ticket stubs reveal layers of his character, but his nobility feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly structured, with the stubs and drone driving revelations. Pacing is excellent, though the combustion lab’s role could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab’s atmosphere is vivid but underutilized. The "hollow recklessness" tone and sensory details (thermal ghosts, burning stubs) are standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling—symbolism (crest, Latin motto), subtext (betrayal), and the haunting ending elevate the narrative. The drone’s confession is a masterstroke.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant. The hummingbird drone and ticket stubs are fresh metaphors. Minor risk of "purple prose" in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question: can truth survive combustion?</comment>
