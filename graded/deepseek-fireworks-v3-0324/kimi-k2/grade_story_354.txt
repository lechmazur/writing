<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wizard's ethereal nature and self-taught skills are vividly portrayed, with motivation anchored in her past and the bear. Her actions align beautifully with her longing and daring compassion, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the bear's cosmic disclaimers, with a clear arc from chase to resolution. Pacing is tight but not rushed, though the finale's compression feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive's glitching sky and auroras create a mesmerizing atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "lattice of dark matter wings") are evocative, and the setting amplifies the wizard's ethereal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (glyphs, auroras) and subtext (memory vs. growth), the story resonates emotionally. The ending is satisfying, and the prose elevates the theme of compassion as gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("heart a quiet supernova") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases skirt flowery excess. The style is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. A standout blend of creativity and craft.</comment>
