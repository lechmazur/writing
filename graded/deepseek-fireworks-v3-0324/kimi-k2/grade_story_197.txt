<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motivations are clear (compassionate con), but her backstory is absent. The patchwork twilight coat and celestial role solidify her uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent, but the sticky-note mechanism feels slightly contrived. The resolution (nightmares becoming constellations) is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—tree’s runes, starlight-filtered chaos, and tactile details (copper-tasting note) immerse deeply. Weakness: "mundanely terrifying" hum underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (fabric scrap as promise, tree as cosmic cradle) and emotional resonance. Ending lingers, but some metaphors verge on overworked ("leaves like shattered mirrors").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and premise. Only demerit: "patchwork twilight" echoes common lyrical tropes. Otherwise, avoids clichés deftly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful. Elements serve the story’s mythic tone. Brief length feels intentional, though deeper thematic exploration could elevate further.</comment>
