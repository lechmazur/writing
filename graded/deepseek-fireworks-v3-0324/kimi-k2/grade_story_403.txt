<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The knight's grief and hope are vividly rendered, with his actions and reactions consistently tied to his failed kingdom and the shell's whispered promise. His voice is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could deepen his complexity.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is tightly woven, with the knight's seclusion and discovery of the staircase feeling inevitable yet surprising. The word limit is well-managed, though the hinge between real and myth could be more sharply articulated early on.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—sensory details (salt, starlight, nacre) merge seamlessly with the floating library's surreal logic. The setting actively reshapes the knight's journey, elevating the ordinary shell into a mythic artifact.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shell as map, books as fish) and layered subtext (forgiveness vs. forgetting) create profound impact. The ending resonates, though the "joyful agony" refrain edges toward overuse.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original—avoids clichés with fresh metaphors ("shelves became seabeds") and nuanced emotion. The tone shifts occasionally (e.g., "joyful agony" repetition), but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical whole. Every element serves the theme of permeable boundaries. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving the reader haunted by the hinge between loss and miracles.</comment>
