<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei-Lin’s motivation is clear and compelling, her actions align with her traits, and her "rationally impulsive" nature is subtly woven into her decisions. The chameleon aspect adds depth to her performance-driven pursuit of truth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Mei-Lin’s investigation and performance forming a coherent arc. The connection between the girl’s fate and Mei-Lin’s resolution feels organic, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace’s decay and the interplay of light/debris create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "frayed lace scratching scales") immerse the reader, and the setting reinforces themes of loss and artifice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft: metaphors (sunlight as "confession"), layered symbolism (the dress as relic), and a resonant ending. The emotional payoff is earned, and the theme—truth through performance—is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The chameleon actor and post-oil palace are fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Nuanced emotions (e.g., "anxious serenity") feel authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich vignette. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. Creative and polished.</comment>
