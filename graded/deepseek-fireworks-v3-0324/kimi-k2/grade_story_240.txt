<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mire's transformation from pragmatic soothsayer to a force of nature is compelling and deeply rooted in her motivation. Her distinct 'voice' and actions align seamlessly with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from Mire's miracles to her ultimate metamorphosis. Pacing is excellent, though the word limit slightly rushes the final resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village is vividly realized, with sensory details (resin scent, metallic vibrations) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the story's eerie, mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor (bark skin, storm caged in ribs) and subtext (surrender vs. control), the story lingers in the mind. The ending is hauntingly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The hammer-as-song and "manufactured miracles" are fresh, and the prose balances lyricism with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, striking whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about the cost of transcendence.</comment>
