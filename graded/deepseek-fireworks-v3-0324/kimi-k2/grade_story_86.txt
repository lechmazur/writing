<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s apprehension and exceptionalism are well-integrated into her actions, though her "archer" aspect feels slightly underutilized beyond the climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is tight and logically driven by Kael’s motivation, though the transition to the festival feels abrupt. The resolution is thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center and "borrowed dawn" create a striking, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., humming servers, golden snow) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (candle as question mark, memories as golden snow) and thematic depth. The ending lingers with poetic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of cyberpunk and mythic tones. Avoids clichés, though "cycles of compassion" leans slightly toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of reclaimed memory.</comment>
