<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and hauntingly consistent—her actions and reactions reveal a deeply complex character, shaped by her environment and impending death. Her "voice" is distinct, even in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with every action driving toward the resolution. Pacing is masterful, and the connection between beginning and end is seamless despite the brevity. No wasted words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The opera house setting is atmospheric and immersive, with evocative sensory details (dust, velvet, wax) that enhance the mood. The "soundless sanctuary" concept is brilliantly executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are used with precision. The ending is purposeful, and the subtext (mortality, defiance) lingers. Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original. No clichés or formulaic writing; metaphors are fresh, and the narrative avoids predictability. The tone is consistent, and the style is distinctively lyrical without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, flawless vignette. Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a haunting, resonant impression.</comment>
