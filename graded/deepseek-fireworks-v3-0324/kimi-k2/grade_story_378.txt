<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gus's motivations and grumpy yet reluctantly noble personality are vividly rendered, aligning seamlessly with his accidental mayoral role and the transformative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the clockwork beetle and swamp's toxicity driving Gus's actions organically. Pacing is deft for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The polluted swamp orchard and carnival-dawn atmosphere are richly immersive, with sensory details (oil-slicked apples, fetid water) enhancing the thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (the beetle’s ticking as "scolding tongues," the grub’s glow) amplify the story’s mythic resonance. The ending is both poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (cynicism "metamorphosing into resolve") and a distinct voice avoid cliché. The grub’s cleansing mechanism feels ingeniously original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Every element serves the narrative cohesively, leaving a lingering impression of fate and renewal. The brevity feels intentional, not constrained.</comment>
