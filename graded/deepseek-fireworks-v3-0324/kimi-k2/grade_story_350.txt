<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The puppeteer's motivation is hauntingly clear, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his obsession, yet more nuance in his voice could elevate the emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with poetic logic, though the transition from stamps to hidden door feels abrupt. Pacing is masterful, and the arc achieves a striking, unsettling resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is electrifying—marble, myrrh, and moonlight merge into a sensory dream. The gown’s "tears like silver threads" is a standout detail, binding object to setting flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism resonate profoundly, but the "symphonies of truth" motif occasionally overpowers subtlety. The ending’s revelation is chilling, though the theme of betrayal could pierce deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite originality, with fresh metaphors ("stamps fluttered like moth wings"). Only minor quibbles: "alone intimacy" repeats, and the puppet’s accusation skirts melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A near-perfect cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, yet the bride’s backstory begs expansion. Lingers like a ghostly refrain.</comment>
