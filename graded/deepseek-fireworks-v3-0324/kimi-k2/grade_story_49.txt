<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage's "lukewarm" magic and "loyally peculiar" nature are vividly rendered, but his motivation to "paint a future free from fear" feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his traits, though deeper introspection could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the fog silhouettes and doormat corner serving as potent symbols. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned. Minor tightening of the "clash with memory" action could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—lunar desolation and "charred serenity" are hauntingly evoked. Sensory details (lunar dust, cold starlight) deepen immersion. The setting and object (doormat) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fog as memory, doormat as lost home) and lyrical prose create a lingering impact. The ending is poignant, though the theme of "forgiveness" could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("charred serenity," "tepid half-miracles"). Avoids clichés, but a few phrases lean slightly ornate. Emotional resonance is subtle yet powerful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive gem. Elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves the reader with a visceral ache—proof of its depth.</comment>
