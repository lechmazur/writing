<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her actions align well with her role as an apprentice turned architect. Her "brazen calm" is a consistent trait, though her "bright-eyed" nature could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Lira's discovery of the star maps driving the narrative logically. The pacing is excellent, though the transition from decoding to rerouting destinies could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with vivid sensory details (salt-crusted stairs, drowned cities’ smell) enhancing the post-war atmosphere. The lighthouse basement is hauntingly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using rich metaphors (droplets as worlds) and subtext (survival vs. wonder). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh imagery and no clichés. The prose is purposeful, and the emotional resonance is shown rather than stated. Avoids AI pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering impact, suggesting depth beyond the plot.</comment>
