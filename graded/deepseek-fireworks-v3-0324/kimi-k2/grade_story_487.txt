<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Goro's docile nature and gentle restraint contrast powerfully with his physicality, creating a compelling character arc. His motivation to "mold a myth" is clear and consistently drives his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the baton's discovery and Goro's transformation forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, leveraging drum solos as temporal markers without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered through sensory details (humming orchids, drum solos) that amplify the eerie yet tender atmosphere. The setting is inseparable from the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (baton as sheet music, plants bowing) elevates the narrative. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with Goro's tears and the greenhouse's transformation leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, subverting tropes (e.g., "docile bruiser," baton used for creation). Language is lush but purposeful, avoiding clich√©. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A masterclass in cohesion: every element serves the story's mythic ambition. The brevity feels artful, with lingering thematic weight (language barriers transcended through music).</comment>
