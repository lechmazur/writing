<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seer's analytical innovation and motivation are clear, but her "nondescript" nature slightly undermines distinctiveness. Her actions align well with her traits, though deeper nuance could elevate her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from mystery to discovery. The USB drive and relic connection is logical, though the warning's abruptness slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout—abandoned control tower and rain scent are evocative. Sensory details (dust, moonlight) deepen immersion, though the party timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rain, Erebus) and subtext. Ending hints at deeper conflict, but the warning's execution lacks subtlety. Style enhances mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining mythic relics with tech. Some phrases verge on cliché ("fragile flame"), but the concept feels fresh overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the party timeframe feels tacked on. The story lingers with thematic depth, but tighter integration of all assigned parts would help.</comment>
