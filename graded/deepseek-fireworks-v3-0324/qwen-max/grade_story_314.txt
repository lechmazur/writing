<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, with her frustration at Solhaven's perfection driving her actions. Her reaction to the bread box reveals her suppressed individuality, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the bread box and shadows driving the action. The ending feels purposeful, though the promise's breaking could be more explicitly tied to earlier setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kelp forest and observation post create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (hum, shadows, glowing kelp) immerse the reader, though the "laughing tears" tone clashes slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bread box, shadows) and subtext (perfection vs. chaos). The ending prompts reflection, but the dialogue with the figure feels slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "genuinely fake" bread box and tribal drumbeat are inventive, though the "laughing tears" tone feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice vs. growth, though the supernatural twist could be more grounded.</comment>
