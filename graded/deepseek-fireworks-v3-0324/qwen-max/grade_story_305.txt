<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's reticence and technical mischievousness are well-integrated, but his motivation to "dethrone complacency" feels slightly abstract for his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, though the "cake baking" timeframe feels incongruous. The knock and sketches method is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and lantern light create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (water lapping, whispers) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tablet, echoes) and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of forgotten history is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, though "technically mischievous" and "pensive mirth" feel forced. Avoids clich√©s but some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story, but a few (cake baking, sketches) distract. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
