<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tortured protector's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness in dialogue. His actions align well with his past and present conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The doll's role as a catalyst is effective, though the planetarium connection feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with strong sensory details. The abandoned circus setting enhances the eerie tone and character's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolism elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue could feel more natural. Subtext is rich but slightly heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the doll's symbolism, but the "suspiciously sweet" motif is overused. Some phrases verge on purple prose, though the core concept feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the planetarium detracts slightly. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth.</comment>
