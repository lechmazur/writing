<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but his emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped; his "hope" is compelling but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the resolution ("recommend unity") feels abrupt and slightly didactic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with strong sensory details (e.g., "metallic feathers glinting"), though the setting's sci-fi elements could be more distinctive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bird, fragments) and subtext, but the ending's thematic punch lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (prophecy, lone hero); some phrases ("cheerless ecstasy") feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story's brevity limits its emotional resonance; the theme is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>
