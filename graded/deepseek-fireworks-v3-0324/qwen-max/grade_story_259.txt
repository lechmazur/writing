<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "cryptic medium" trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her myth-collecting drive, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The accidental double-booking feels contrived, though the automaton encounter provides a strong resolution. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The factory setting enhances the theme, though the "sterile lights" clash slightly with the organic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, particularly in the automaton's quest for meaning. The ending is purposeful, but the dialogue feels slightly stiff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of myth and cybernetics is inventive, though the "comforting unease" tone could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering question about identity, though the word limit slightly constrains depth.</comment>
