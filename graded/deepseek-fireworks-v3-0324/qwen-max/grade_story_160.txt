<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The clandestine watchman's motivation is clear and deeply tied to the goggles, but his "analytically free" attribute could be more explicitly woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the goggles driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "final bow" timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is vividly rendered with sensory details, and its decay mirrors the watchman's defiance of finality. The atmosphere is immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (goggles as resistance, braille-like bumps as fragmented history) elevates the story. The ending is satisfying, and the prose is polished without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "prickly wonder" occasionally feels forced. The metaphors are fresh, and the emotional resonance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It lingers in the mind due to its thematic depth.</comment>
