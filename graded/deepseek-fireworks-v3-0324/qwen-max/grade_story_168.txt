<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ruthless flower arranger's sharp, methodical nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to decode the rock art is clear and consistent. Her use of the comb reveals her relentless curiosity, though her "polite anarchy" tone could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her quest, but the road trip conversation method feels slightly forced. The ending ties back to the beginning thematically, though pacing is uneven in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stone circle setting is immersive and enhances the mystery. Sensory details (wind, harmonica, comb's scrape) are evocative, though the "pause between verses" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comb, paint) and subtext about connection. The ending is satisfying, but dialogue occasionally feels stilted. Theme emerges clearly but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (stone circle as "unruly bouquet"). Avoids clich√©s, though "polite anarchy" leans generic. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The comb's reveal is inventive, but the road trip device slightly disrupts cohesion. Lingers thoughtfully on connection.</comment>
