<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's earnestness and purpose are clear, but his motivation ("spark flames in a land of ice") feels slightly abstract. His actions align well, but deeper introspection could elevate his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Alden's mapping, but the reveal of the cloaked figure feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., "fractured like frozen tears"). The desert and greenhouse create a haunting atmosphere that enhances the story's mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (map, fractures) and evocative prose elevate the narrative. The ending hints at deeper meaning but could delve further into thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the greenhouse's celestial mechanism, but some phrases ("canvas of life") verge on clich√©. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "canvas of life" concept feels underdeveloped. The story lingers but lacks a definitive punch.</comment>
