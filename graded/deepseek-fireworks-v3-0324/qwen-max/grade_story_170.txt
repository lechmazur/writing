<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her academic failure, but her "free-spirited" nature feels underdeveloped compared to her artistic side.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the letters serving as a clever bridge between past and present, though the stormy-night revelation leans slightly toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coral station and ocean decay are vividly rendered, but the "breathless longing" tone occasionally overpowers the setting's grit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sewing kit as mending tool) and emotional resonance, though the ending's redemption arc borders on predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its coral-restoration focus, but the "heart of doubt" metaphor feels overused. Lira's academic shame is nuanced, but Elara's letters verge on trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, though the "academically artistic" attribute could be more integrated. The length feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
