<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear and compelling, but his naivety feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his desperation, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the transition to the dock feels abrupt. The ending is evocative but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the story's eerie, mystical tone, though the tidal station's role could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, with a haunting ending. The dialogue is purposeful, but the professor's lecture could feel less expositional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clich√©s. The candle mold and bargains feel fresh, though the gambler's laughter-tears moment leans slightly toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but the story could benefit from slightly more room to breathe.</comment>
