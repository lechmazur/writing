<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his identity as a time refugee, but his "trustworthy strange" attribute could be more explicitly woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the action of "catapulting" forward serving as a strong climax. The connection between the tablecloth and the stars is logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "eerie glow" and "crackling air" enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tablecloth as memory, lighthouse as relic) and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of redemption for forgotten empires is poignant and well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("threads shimmering faintly as though they held fragments of stars"). No clich√©s or AI-generated flatness detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's cohesion. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
