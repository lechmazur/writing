<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her guilt and hope, but her "lovingly hateful" paradox could be more vividly explored to heighten emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution of the crack feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply atmospheric story where elements serve the narrative rather than constrain it. Lingers after reading.</comment>
