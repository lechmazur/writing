<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Callan's motivation is clear and consistent, but Lira's introduction feels slightly rushed. Their dynamic is promising but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution with the sentinels feels abrupt. The fortune cookie slip ties neatly into the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating island spa is vividly rendered, and sensory details enhance the atmosphere. The setting supports the story's whimsical yet urgent tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (e.g., the fortune cookie) and shows rather than tells. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The world-building and character interactions feel authentic, though some phrases border on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, though a tad more depth would elevate it further.</comment>
