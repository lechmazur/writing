<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elliot's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his melancholic yet hopeful nature. His actions align well with his desire to break free from generational shadows, though his "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the amber and lantern festival tradition driving the narrative forward logically. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (mildew, burnt popcorn) enhancing the atmosphere. The amber's connection to the setting and ghosts is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (amber as a "thawing heart," the lantern as hope) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, and the prose avoids overt telling in favor of evocative showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, with minimal clich√©s. The melancholic tone and ghostly interactions feel nuanced, though the "fleeting rebellion" motif could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, leaving the reader with a sense of quiet transformation.</comment>
