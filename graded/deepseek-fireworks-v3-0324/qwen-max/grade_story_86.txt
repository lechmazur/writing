<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archer's apprehension and exceptionalism under pressure are well-conveyed, but her motivation could be more deeply explored to align with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, though the hot air balloon festival feels slightly tangential. The resolution is satisfying but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and neon-lit atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood and tension. The candle's connection to the world is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story employs strong symbolism (candle, truth) and evokes emotional resonance, though some metaphors ("borrowed dawn") feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but the "cycles of compassion" theme could be more integrated. The prose is purposeful but occasionally ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative well. It leaves a lingering impression but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
