<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The noble's empirically rebellious spirit and motivation to "wed logic and madness" are compelling, but his dazed state feels underdeveloped, leaving some actions slightly unmotivated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds toward a satisfying moment of revelation, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the scholar's introduction and the garden's mystery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly rendered, with resonant sensory details that amplify the story's ethereal tone. The setting and object (chalk) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism ("Logic bends; madness breaks") and subtext, though the dialogue leans slightly toward exposition. The ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The noble's voice and the garden's sentience feel fresh, though "benign ferocity" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the chalk and garden serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, though the scholar's role could be deepened.</comment>
