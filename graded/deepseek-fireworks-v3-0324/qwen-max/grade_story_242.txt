<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness in dialogue. His fascination with herbs and ambition to bridge cultures are well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The confrontation with Mira resolves tension abruptly. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details (e.g., "fragrant whispers"). The vault setting enhances the story's tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (herbs as connection) and subtext. Ending is purposeful but could linger more. Dialogue is natural, though sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "loyalties shifted like shadows"). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing leans slightly generic ("tense atmosphere").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the phone booth operator role feels underutilized. Story lingers thematically but lacks a stronger emotional punch.</comment>
