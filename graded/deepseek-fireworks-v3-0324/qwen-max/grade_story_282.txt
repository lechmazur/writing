<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Callan's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "brash" nature feels underdeveloped in action. His wildness is well-described but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Callan's action, but the "detonation" metaphor feels slightly forced. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details enhancing the setting. The "dancing dust particle chamber" is vivid but slightly over-described.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract ending. The theme of preservation is compelling but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on flowery. The nautilus shell metaphor is fresh, but the "dusty exuberance" tone feels inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its length. The ending lingers but lacks full thematic resolution.</comment>
