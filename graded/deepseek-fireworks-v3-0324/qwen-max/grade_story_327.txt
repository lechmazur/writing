<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's restlessness and creative struggle are well-defined, but his motivation to "turn raw imagination into reality" feels slightly abstract. His interaction with the merchant adds depth, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the road closure redirecting the class effectively. The merchant's role provides resolution, but the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cave pearl diving school is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The pool's reflective quality ties beautifully to the theme, though the merchant's presence slightly disrupts the setting's cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cave pearls, blank card) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of "layered tranquility" could be more consistently woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors ("iridescent orbs born from centuries of quiet persistence"). The merchant's dialogue feels slightly contrived, but the restlessness trade is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection, though the merchant's role could be more integrated.</comment>
