<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elira's uncertainty and meticulous nature are well-established, but her sudden shift to following instincts feels slightly abrupt. The coin purse's symbolism is strong but could be more deeply integrated into her motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the labyrinth map and coin purse revelation creating a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the workshop's transformation at the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The workshop's vastness and "fractured beauty" are vividly rendered, with sensory details (molten metal, ancient dust) enhancing immersion. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (purse as vessel for potential) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending resonates thematically, though the theme could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The playful craftsmanship of the purse and labyrinth map stand out, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story elegantly. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the golden age backdrop feels underutilized.</comment>
