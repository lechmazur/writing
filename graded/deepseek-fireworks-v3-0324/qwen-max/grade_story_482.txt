<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered with clear motivation—his insomnia fuels his art, and his unresolved past with Lila drives his actions. His voice and reactions feel distinct and human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from frustration to resolution. The scrying scene serves as a pivotal moment, and the pacing balances urgency with reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop and mushroom forest create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (paint, rainwater) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies Elias's isolation and creativity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the hat, smiles) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, and the prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The wizard’s hat and scrying method feel fresh, and emotions are shown through action and subtext rather than stated.</comment>
