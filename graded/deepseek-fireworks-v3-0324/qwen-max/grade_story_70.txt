<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scribe's uptight nature and trembling uncertainty are vividly portrayed, aligning well with his motivation. His reaction to the bulb reveals depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bulb's transformation serving as a clear climax. Pacing is excellent, and cause-effect relationships are logical. The word limit is used effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestones create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (damp earth, metallic tang) enhance mood and align perfectly with the story's eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (light as empathy) and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of connection is layered and impactful, with strong 'show, don't tell' execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The Tesla-lightbulb twist is ingenious, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Emotional nuance is handled well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story masterfully. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder about empathy's transformative power.</comment>
