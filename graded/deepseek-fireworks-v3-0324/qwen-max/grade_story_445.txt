<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; the nomad's exhaustion and spiritual materialism are well-conveyed, though his "restless journey" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the transition from hiking trail to disguise room feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with the eerie forest and glowing symbols enhancing the mystical tone. The disguise room's contrast with the natural setting works well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (barbells, masks) is effective, and the reconciliation subtext adds depth. Dialogue is purposeful, though the ending's "otherworldly glow" verges on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong in concept but slightly undermined by predictable tropes (hidden door, chance reunion). Emotional nuance in the reconciliation saves it from feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the disguise room feels slightly out of place. The story lingers with thematic weight but could push further.</comment>
