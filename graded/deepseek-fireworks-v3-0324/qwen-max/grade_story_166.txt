<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin's motivation is clear but his "solemnly silly" demeanor feels underdeveloped. His actions with the straw reveal curiosity and desperation, but his ghostly nature lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Orin's quest, though the fox encounter feels abrupt. The ending's surreal shift works well within the word limit, suggesting a larger arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (auroras, gurgling streams) immerse the reader, though the "gentle chaos" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (straw, veil) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful but could delve deeper into thematic resonance. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The plastic straw as a mystical tool is inventive, though some phrases ("translucent hands") verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on liminality and longing.</comment>
