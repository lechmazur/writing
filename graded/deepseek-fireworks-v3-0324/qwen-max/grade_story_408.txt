<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's conscientious objector status and his motivation to map bird migrations are clear and consistent, but his "valiant boredom" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the neighborhood watch element feels tangential. The pacing is strong, but the ending is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vividly atmospheric, with excellent sensory details. The "coy malevolence" tone is effectively unsettling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rusty nail) and subtext, but the dialogue with the masked figures feels slightly forced. The ending lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The rusty nail tradition is fresh, though the "neighborhood watch" concept feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but some elements (craft fairs, watch group) feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
