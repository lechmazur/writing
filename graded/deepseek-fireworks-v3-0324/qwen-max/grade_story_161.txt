<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with a distinct voice and sardonic tone. The orchardist's backstory and vigilance drive his actions convincingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The conspiracy unraveling is logical, though the peacock tail method feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is unique but underutilized. Atmosphere supports the tone, though sensory details could be sharper to enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (peacock tail, seal) and subtext. Ending is satisfying, with emotional resonance and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases border on overly formal. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the story feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thought about corporate greed and personal vindication.</comment>
