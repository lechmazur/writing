<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eryndor's internal conflict is vividly portrayed, with his fading resolve and desperate need for escape aligning well with his frail nature. However, his "resolutely wavering" attribute could be more consistently integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Eryndor's choice, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the final act. The connection between the bark messages and his decision could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal island and misty atmosphere are richly evoked, enhancing the story's melancholy tone. Sensory details like the phial's scent and the hissing mark are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (fading marks, the unyielding sigil) and subtext (freedom vs. identity) are strong, but the ending's emotional impact is slightly muted by the abrupt resolution of the final mark.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "mist like an unspoken secret"). However, the "sorting season" timeframe feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity works, but the story’s thematic depth slightly outweighs its narrative tightness. The lingering question of Eryndor’s final mark is compelling.</comment>
