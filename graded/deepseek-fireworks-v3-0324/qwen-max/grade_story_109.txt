<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's cold nature and artistic awakening are compellingly juxtaposed, but his shift from collecting folk remedies to supporting others feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the mitten serving as a poignant catalyst. Pacing is excellent, though the transition into the underground facility could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (frosty air, fluorescent lights) enhancing the clandestine, melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mitten, altars) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though the "artistic awakening" theme could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, but the "lawfully rebellious" attribute leans slightly toward cliché. The prose avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that lingers. The brevity feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story’s depth.</comment>
