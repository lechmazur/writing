<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but her "hyperactively serene" demeanor could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of closure, but the steampunk setting feels underutilized in driving the narrative forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk atmosphere is evocative but somewhat disconnected from the emotional core of the story. Sensory details are strong but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (stickers, mixtapes) and a poignant emotional arc. The ending is satisfying, though the "savage grace" tone isn't fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "music slip through her fingers like sand"). Minor over-reliance on stated emotions ("her heart throbbed").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the steampunk backdrop feels slightly forced.</comment>
