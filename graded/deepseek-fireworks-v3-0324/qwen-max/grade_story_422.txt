<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elise's selectively mute ventriloquism and optimism are vividly portrayed, but her weather-archiving motivation feels slightly tangential to her core traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently, but the transition to the boardwalk encounter feels abrupt. The tight word limit slightly undermines the arc's natural progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diner's late-night atmosphere is richly evoked, though the parallel universe beach is underutilized. Sensory details (coffee sleeve, wind) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (Finnegan, coffee sleeve) and subtext, but the ending's emotional impact is muted by brevity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "chart hope"), though the "euphoric agitation" tone wobbles. Avoids clich√©s and shows nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the parallel universe beach and weather-archiving motif feel slightly forced. Leaves a lingering, if uneven, impression.</comment>
