<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "freelancer" trait feels underutilized. The ring's significance deepens her character effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the rival's arrival feels abrupt. The action-driven resolution works within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere is vivid and immersive, though the wedding timeframe adds little. Sensory details (hiss of machinery, amber glow) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ring, waves) and subtext (preservation vs. power). Ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ring's lore, but "scattered harmony" tone feels forced. Some phrases verge on flowery without payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the freelancer premise feels tacked on. The brevity serves the tension but limits thematic depth.</comment>
