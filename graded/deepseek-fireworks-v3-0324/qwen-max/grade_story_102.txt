<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness and motivation are clear, but his transformation into a mentor feels slightly rushed. The key's symbolism is strong, but his internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the key's mystery, but the transition from map room to forest is abrupt. Pacing is tight but effective for the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending lacks full resolution. Dialogue is purposeful, and the theme of doubt is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The dollhouse key is a fresh twist, and the tone is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
