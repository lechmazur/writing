<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Callan's underachieving nature and flicker of excitement are well-conveyed, but his motivation to "spring a trap on his own limitations" feels slightly abstract. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with a clear arc from boredom to revelation. The doll head's role as a catalyst is logical, but the space station setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland boundary create an intriguing contrast, but sensory details are sparse. The atmosphere supports the tone but lacks deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll head, runes) and a satisfying ending. The theme of reclaiming potential is clear, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "hum faintly"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "bored excitement" tone occasionally wavers into generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the space station feels tangential. Leaves a lingering question about Callan's heritage, suggesting depth.</comment>
