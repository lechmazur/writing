<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, blending survival with quiet pride. Her connection to the skeleton key necklace adds depth, though her "blameless" nature could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lira's overreach, but the "final countdown" feels underutilized. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>
