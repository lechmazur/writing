<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias Vayne's motivation is clear and compelling, but his backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His obsession with the seashell and midnight's fleeting nature is intriguing, but more nuance in his voice or past would elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the diaries' introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with sensory elements (burnt cedar, ozone, flickering lanterns) enhancing the eerie, magical tone. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the shell, midnight) and subtext. The ending is purposeful and resonant, leaving room for reflection. The prose is evocative without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The concept of "mirroring the soul" is fresh, and the writing style is distinct. Minor quibble: "frantic peace" toes the line of purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Only a touch more character depth would make it flawless.</comment>
