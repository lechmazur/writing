<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear but lacks depth; his philosophically shallow nature is consistent but underdeveloped. The washcloth and locket reveal his duality but his voice is indistinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between the washcloth and locket feels abrupt. The ending resolves too neatly for the shallow setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, but the garden scene's musical plants feel slightly gimmicky. Atmosphere supports the tone but overshadows character nuance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (washcloth, locket) and evocative prose, but the theme of compassion vs. control lacks subtext. The ending's transformation is told more than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but Kael's emotional arc relies on familiar tropes. Some phrases ("cascading rainbows," "liquid mercury") verge on clich√©. The washcloth is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The locket's starlight shard is inventive, but the dance timeframe adds little.</comment>
