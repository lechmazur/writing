<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The exorcist's "inwardly social" trait is subtly woven into his actions, but his motivation could be clearer. Dr. Voss's anticipation of his moves adds intrigue but feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with puzzles driving the narrative. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the final "surrender" feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with the vintage postcards and dim facility enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details like the whispering walls and soft light immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism in postcards, subtext in riddles) are effective. The ending is purposeful but could delve deeper into the science-supernatural balance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of exorcism and science. Some phrases ("gnawed at him like an unscratchable itch") verge on clich√©, but the premise feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the dance lessons feel slightly tangential. The story lingers with thematic depth but could tighten its focus.</comment>
