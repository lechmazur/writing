<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The missionary's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his crisis of faith, but his "capriciously consistent" nature could be more vividly demonstrated through actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the piano's dissonance and the fork's transformation logically leading to the climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The glass desert and monarch butterfly migration create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crunching sand, liquid light) elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork, butterfly) and layered themes (faith vs. persistence) resonate. The ending is poignant, though the "liquid light" revelation borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but the "capriciously consistent" attribute feels underutilized. Some phrases ("fragile ember") verge on overused lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the fork and piano serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, though the butterfly's role could be deepened.</comment>
