<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is subtly revealed through introspection and action, but the 'lone trapper' archetype feels slightly underdeveloped for such a high-concept setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a clear arc, though the microfilm decoding could feel contrived without deeper context. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with stellar sensory details. The floating observatory and sea glass are brilliantly interconnected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice with minimal clichés, though "gritty whimsy" tone wobbles in places. Emotional nuance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though some elements (like microfilm) strain believability. Leaves a lingering, melancholic resonance.</comment>
