<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lucan's motivation is clear but his "eager lookout" trait feels underdeveloped. His connection to the sewing box is evocative but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The ghostly whisper and tapestry reveal feel abrupt, lacking buildup. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”vivid sensory details and haunting mood elevate the setting. The villa feels alive, but "technically organic" is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext, but the ending lacks emotional payoff. Themes of connection are hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar ghost-story tropes. The sewing box and "ruthless kindness" are fresh touches, though some phrasing feels overly polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels constrained by its length. The premise is inventive, but execution lacks depth due to brevity.</comment>
