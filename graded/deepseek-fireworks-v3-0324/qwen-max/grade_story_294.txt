<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "dry-tongued" attribute feels underutilized in action. His use of voicemails is poignant but slightly disjointed from his bardic identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection, slowing momentum. The connection between preservation and self-liberation is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom hall and bioluminescence create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (prism’s light, static-laden voicemails) elevate the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (prism, cloak of doubt) and lyrical prose, but the ending’s clarity slightly falters. Emotional resonance is high, though the theme could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The "gorgeously awkward" phrasing risks preciousness, but the voicemail method feels fresh. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the mushroom hall and bardic identity feel slightly forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
