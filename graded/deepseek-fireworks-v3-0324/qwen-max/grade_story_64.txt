<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's uncertainty and wild nature are well-portrayed, but his motivation to map forest trails feels slightly disconnected from his immediate quest for immortality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed in places, particularly the transition from Kael's forest mapping to the marketplace. The ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "hush before the verdict" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the scale, coded scuffs) and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by the rushed resolution. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, though some phrases verge on flowery. The theme of sacrifice vs. knowledge is handled with nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits depth. Leaves a lingering question but feels constrained by word count.</comment>
