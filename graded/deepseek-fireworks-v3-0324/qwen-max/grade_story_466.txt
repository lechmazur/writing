<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "elusive destiny" trope leans generic. The xerograph twist is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the grocery setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, but some threads beg expansion.</comment>
