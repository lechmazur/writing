<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with the chopstick and tea leaves serving as strong symbolic anchors. His "heart's revolt" is compelling, though his "irate" nature could be more dynamically shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between jogging and the spaceport setting feels slightly forced. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and star-domed atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholy tone. Sensory details (steam, grime) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is poignant, though the "hidden waterfalls" motif could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clich√©s. The chopstick as a talisman is fresh, but the "heart's revolt" phrasing leans slightly toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Lingers on themes of betrayal and memory effectively.</comment>
