<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liang's motivation is clear and compelling, blending rationality and impulsivity well. His emotional depth and connection to the doll's dress reveal a nuanced character, though his "chameleon" trait could be more explicitly tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from clue to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the oil-extraction backdrop feels slightly underutilized in driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace-turned-theater is vividly rendered, with sensory details (jasmine scent, fractured light) enhancing atmosphere. The setting and object (doll's dress) are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (light as truth, theater as memory) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is poignant and thematically cohesive, though the "anxious serenity" tone wavers slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The post-oil world and Mei's twist subvert expectations. Some phrases ("rationally impulsive") verge on overly clever but don't detract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the doll's dress and reproduction theme lending depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
