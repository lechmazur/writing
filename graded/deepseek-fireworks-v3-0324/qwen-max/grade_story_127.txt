<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his past, but his "secret" as a street performer feels underdeveloped. His creative block and reconciliation arc are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from coral memory to gauntlet revelation feels slightly abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is vividly rendered, but the coral reef memory feels disconnected from the setting. Sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (gauntlet as betrayal) is effective, and the emotional resonance is strong. However, the theme of "trust renewed" isn't fully explored by the end.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, but the coral reef metaphor feels forced. The tone avoids clich√©s, though some descriptors are overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and impactful, but the steampunk setting feels underutilized. The brevity works, but some elements could be deeper.</comment>
