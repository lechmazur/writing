<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's quiet desolation and fractured identity are compelling, but his transition to the forest feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's surreal shift to the forest is intriguing but risks incoherence; the resolution with the mirror is strong but could be better foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (plants, mirrors) enhancing the mood, though the forest's introduction slightly disrupts the study's established tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirrors, masks) is potent, and the ending resonates, but some metaphors (e.g., "carbonized") feel overworked. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The plant communication study and fractured reflection are fresh, though the forest sequence edges toward familiar surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the theme of belonging. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
