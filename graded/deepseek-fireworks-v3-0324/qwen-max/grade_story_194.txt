<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear contradictions and motivations, though his "gracefully awkward" trait could be more consistently demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the letter, but the ossuary setting feels slightly abrupt, and the pacing tightens too quickly near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (smoke, bones) enhancing the eerie tone, though the bike rides could be more vividly tied to the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (letter as map, vial as remedy) and emotional depth, but the betrayal subplot resolves too hastily.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors (e.g., "macabre chandeliers"), though Maris's backstory edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the word limit strains the ending's emotional payoff. The story lingers, but not as deeply as it could.</comment>
