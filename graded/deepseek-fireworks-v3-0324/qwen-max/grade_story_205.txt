<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's delicate warrior persona and cynical armor are well-developed, but his motivation to "sow laughter" feels slightly under-explored given the weight of the secret he carries.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the seaweed's significance, though the cameo's introduction feels abrupt. The ending resolves cleanly but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swamp's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with fireflies and mist enhancing the eerie tension. The setting deeply influences Kael's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seaweed, cameo) and evocative prose, but the emotional impact of the secret's revelation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of melancholy and whimsy, though the "fate of a secret" trope leans slightly generic. Nuanced handling of Kael's cynicism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the cameo feels less integrated than the seaweed. The brevity serves the story's mystique.</comment>
