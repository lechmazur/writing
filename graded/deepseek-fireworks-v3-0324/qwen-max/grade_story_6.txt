<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skeptical minstrel's motivations and reactions are clear and consistent, with his distrust of the trickster driving his actions. His distinct voice and personality shine through dialogue and internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the trickster's arrival and the vanishing ink vial driving the narrative forward logically. The ending feels purposeful, though slightly abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned factory setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (steam vent, peeling paint) that enhance the eerie, irreverent tone. The atmosphere supports both character and concept seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (arrow, ink) and subtext (trust vs. deception). The dialogue is sharp, and the ending lingers, though the theme could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The trickster's whimsy and the minstrel's skepticism feel nuanced, though the "impossibly plausible" stakes could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on choice and consequence.</comment>
