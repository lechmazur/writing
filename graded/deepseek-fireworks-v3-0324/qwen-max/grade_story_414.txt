<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's loyalty and wanderer nature are well-established, but Lira's backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Their motivations are clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the dance class connection feels contrived. The resolution is satisfying, though the middle could tighten.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
