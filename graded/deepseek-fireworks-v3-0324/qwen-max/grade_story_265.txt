<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The deputy's impassive yet subtly brave demeanor is compelling, but his motivation ("to witness a moment of pure grace") feels underdeveloped and abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the connection between "oil changes" and the cathedral setting is tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though some logic gaps remain.</comment>
