<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The emissary's unease and motivation are clear, but his "consistently surprising" attribute feels underdeveloped. The coathanger symbolism is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the debris crisis resolution feels rushed. The postcard motif ties well to redemption but disrupts pacing slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orbital station setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's solemn tone. Sensory details (machinery hum, postcard rustle) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism (coathanger, branches), but the ending’s emotional payoff leans slightly toward telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original handling of space debris and redemption. Avoids clichés, though the emissary’s role borders on trope. Language is purposeful and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the picnic timeframe feels tangential. The story lingers thoughtfully on growth amid chaos.</comment>
