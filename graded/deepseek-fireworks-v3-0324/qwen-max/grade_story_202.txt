<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's paradoxical nature ("innocently guilty") is compelling, but her "careful poisoner" trait feels underutilized. Her motivation to "test gravity" is intriguing but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure works well, but the climax (meteorite alignment) feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly atmospheric, and the skateboarding contrast adds dynamism. Sensory details (e.g., "dusty starlight") are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier, meteorite) and subtext. The ending is ambiguous but purposeful. Style enhances mood.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("silent as dusty starlight"). Avoids clich√©s, though "code of instinct" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the scavenger hunt slightly overshadows character depth. Leaves a lingering question.</comment>
