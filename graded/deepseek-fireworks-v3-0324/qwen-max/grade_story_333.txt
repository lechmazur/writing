<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's sincerity and rebellious nature are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "braided bitterness" could be more deeply explored to fully distinguish her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sticky note and passage serving as effective catalysts. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (damp earth, writhing carvings) enhancing the haunted passage's eerie weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (the carvings, the note) and subtext (fear as a living force) are compelling, but the ending's emotional payoff could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original in its exploration of fear as a collective, shaping force. Avoids clich√©s, though the "haunted passage" trope is lightly subverted rather than reinvented.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the sticky note and carvings serving as clever narrative anchors. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
