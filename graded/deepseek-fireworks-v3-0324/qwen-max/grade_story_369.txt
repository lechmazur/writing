<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias Venn is vividly drawn, with his "optimistically bitter" nature and fanatical puzzle-making driving the narrative. His motivation to track spiritual development through puzzles is clear and consistent, though his emotional shift near the end could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the arrival of mysterious packages and the puzzle's completion forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the final revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is atmospheric and immersive, with fog, moonlight, and stormy seas enhancing the mood. Sensory details like the "black glass" puzzle piece and the "weary sentinel" beam are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the puzzle as a mirror, the lighthouse's radiant light) and a haunting ending elevate the story. The theme of release from secrets is poignant, though the voice's genderless echo risks clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding tropes. The puzzle-maker premise is inventive, though the "weight of secrets" theme is somewhat familiar. Nuanced emotion and subtext shine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story beautifully. The ending lingers, though the missing final piece's discovery feels slightly contrived.</comment>
