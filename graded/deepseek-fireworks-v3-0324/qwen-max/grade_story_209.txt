<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Callan's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with the antique hairbrush serving as a poignant symbol of his past. His actions and reactions reveal a layered, introspective character, though his "seasoned woodsman" trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the echo-measuring method driving the narrative toward a resonant climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from mapping railways to freeing souls could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and water tower create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (static, rusted metal) elevate the mood, though the "despairing cheer" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hairbrush as talisman, echoes as trapped stories) and a cathartic ending make this deeply impactful. The theme of honesty as liberation is woven skillfully into every element.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The hairbrush's role is fresh, though the "freed by honesty" concept edges toward familiarity. Nuanced emotional subtext elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. Leaves a lingering emotional weight, though the radio wave garden's purpose feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
