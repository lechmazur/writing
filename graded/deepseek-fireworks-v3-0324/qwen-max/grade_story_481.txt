<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed with clear motivation, but his "perceptive cartographer" trait feels underutilized beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the forge reveal lacks buildup. The dragonfly's thematic weight compensates.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with vivid sensory details, though the futuristic hospital setting clashes subtly with the nostalgic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext, but the ending's philosophical pivot feels abrupt. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thought-provoking, but some elements (e.g., futuristic setting) feel marginally forced.</comment>
