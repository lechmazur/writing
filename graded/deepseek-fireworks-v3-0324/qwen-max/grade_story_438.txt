<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with clear motivation, but his "vague mystic" label feels underdeveloped. His duality (scientist/dreamer) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans on mystical convenience (compass spinning). The photo discovery drives momentum, though resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab setting contrasts brilliantly with mystical elements. Sensory details (buzzing lights, dusty album) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (compass, horizon) and evocative prose, but emotional depth is hinted at rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of science and mysticism. Avoids clich√©s, though "hollow recklessness" tone wobbles slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the ending feels like setup rather than payoff. Length suits the vignette style.</comment>
