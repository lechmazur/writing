<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Callan's trickster nature and motivation to preserve languages are compelling, but his "impatient yet patient" duality feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the cryptic dare, though the transition to the restricted zone feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details (e.g., glowing fungi) enhancing the ghostly tone. Sensory immersion is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (carvings, phonograph) and subtext about choices elevate the story. The ending lingers, though Elira's reveal could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "spectral as echoes of words"). Avoids clich√©s, though the rival's role edges toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the gift tag and biodome serving the theme. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
