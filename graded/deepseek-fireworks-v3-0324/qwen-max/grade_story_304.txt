<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is intriguing but slightly abstract; their actions align well with their role, though deeper personal stakes could enhance their impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, but the connection between the assassin's goal and the bus driver's arc feels underdeveloped.</comment>
