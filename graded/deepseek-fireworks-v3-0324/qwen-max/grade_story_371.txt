<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swashbuckler's motivation ("to shelter kindness in a world on fire") is compelling and distinct, though his "fervent apathy" could be more sharply defined to avoid tonal ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a mini-arc, but the connection between the marbles and the hatpin feels slightly contrived, weakening cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk night market is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the storm's aftermath ("heavier than thunder") slightly overreaches for poetic effect.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hatpin, synth-coffee) and subtext, but the ending's resolution leans slightly toward sentimentality, undercutting the "fervent apathy" tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "kindness here was currency without value"), though "fashionably unfashionable" risks clich√© without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storm timeframe and marbles method feel less integrated than the core concept and setting.</comment>
