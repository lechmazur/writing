<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from con artist to guardian is compelling, though his motivation could be more deeply explored. His "dishonestly honest" nature is clear but slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the detour feels contrived. The yodeling payoff is strong, though the bridge between past and present could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The waiting room's tension and whimsical stage contrast effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is achieved through symbolism (sheet music) and subtext, but the ending's whimsy slightly undermines the earnest stakes. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the yodeling twist and setting, though "guardian of tomorrow’s flame" borders on cliché. Nuanced emotion avoids AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the detour and whimsical tone distract from thematic weight. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for deeper reflection.</comment>
