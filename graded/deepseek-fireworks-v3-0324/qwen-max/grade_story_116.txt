<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "dismayed" state could be more vividly explored to enhance emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the broken watch band revelation providing a satisfying arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky-lounge and city lights create a mesmerizing atmosphere, with sensory details (e.g., "windows glowing like stars trapped in amber") elevating immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (watch band as time/metaphor) and evocative prose make the story linger. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "laconic exuberance" feels underdeveloped. Avoids clich√©s but could lean further into idiosyncratic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, leaving a haunting impression. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
