<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The guard's paradoxical loyalty and disloyalty are intriguing, but his motivation to "seize the horizon" feels slightly abstract. His actions with the spoon and typewriter reveal depth, though his voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The typewriter's rhythm drives the narrative, but the ending with the shadowy figure feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating café and midnight grocery store create a haunting, dreamlike contrast. Sensory details (buzzing lights, mist) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spoon, horizon) and subtext. The ending lingers, though the dialogue with the shadowy figure could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clichés. The "frothy despair" tone is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the café and spoon enriching the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
