<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "self-taught wizard" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration of how it shapes his actions beyond chasing auroras.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bear's ricochet driving momentum. The resolution is satisfying, though the cosmic disclaimers could be more integrated into the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly rendered, with aurora patterns and alien frequencies creating a mesmerizing atmosphere. The singed teddy bear adds tactile dissonance, grounding the ethereal setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bear as tether, auroras as lost civilization) elevates the narrative. The ending resonates, but "daring compassion" feels stated rather than shown through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "elegant chaos" leans slightly into purple prose. The bear's backstory is fresh, but alien frequencies risk clich√© without deeper subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story's emotional core. The length feels deliberate, though the wizardry aspect could be more fully realized.</comment>
