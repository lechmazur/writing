<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and healing touch are well-integrated into her character, revealing depth and motivation. Her actions align with her traits, though her "lightly heavyhearted" demeanor could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the jam-tasting method feels slightly contrived as a driver for introspection. Pacing is effective, though the resolution could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and twilight lake create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (taste, touch) are used masterfully to enhance mood and character reflection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (jams as memories). However, the theme of fear coexisting with healing could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "liquid glass"). Some phrases verge on flowery, but the voice avoids AI-generic pitfalls. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the jam-tasting device slightly strains logic. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on fear and healing.</comment>
