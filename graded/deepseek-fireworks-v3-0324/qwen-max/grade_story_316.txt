<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calla's timid yet defiant nature is well-developed, and her motivation tied to Elias is clear and poignant. Her actions align with her established traits, though her "seraphic" quality feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Calla's emotional journey, though the arcade detour slightly disrupts pacing. The connection between beginning and end is strong, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the melancholic atmosphere. The temple and arcade are meaningfully connected to the theme, though the factory whistle's timeframe feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ribbon, scoreboard) and emotional resonance, but the theme of collective healing could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but lacks subversion or surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, though some phrases verge on flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced, but the "seraphic" descriptor feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the arcade sequence slightly weakens momentum.</comment>
