<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Riley's motivation is clear and primal, but their backstory as a former child star feels underutilized in shaping their current actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying inward twist, though the chamber's role could be more explicitly tied to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly immersive, with sensory details (light, vibrations) enhancing the eerie, chaotic mood. The chamber and map are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance is slightly muted by Riley's detached ambition. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "wild magic of madness" concept is intriguing, though the prose occasionally veers into overly ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of self-discovery.</comment>
