<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The tapestry and song tie the arc together effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about legacy and renewal.</comment>
