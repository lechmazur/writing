<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Riven's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his character. His "carefully reckless" nature and quest for redemption are compelling, though his "shaky" trait could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly paced, with a clear arc from rumored quest to emotional resolution. The connection between the amber's release and Riven's redemption is effective, though the "improbable rumor chains" could be more developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (graffiti, paint chips, stained glass) enhancing the atmosphere. The "slow-fading hour" and street artist backdrop elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as past, phoenix as rebirth) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of confronting the past is somewhat overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (spider's legs as "tiny swords") avoid clich√©. The tone balances melancholy and hope without feeling algorithmic, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that transcends its word limit. The elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering impression of release and renewal.</comment>
