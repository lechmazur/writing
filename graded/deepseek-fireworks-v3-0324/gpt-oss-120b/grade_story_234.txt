<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's late-blooming kindness and internal conflict are compelling, but his "faithfully unfaithful" nature feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows organically, with the sundial cipher and matchbox resolving elegantly, though the xenophile concept slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere with evocative sensory details (bones sighing, violet light), though the orchard dog's role is underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (T-rex skull as empty matchbox) and nuanced emotion, though "brusque affection" tone wobbles in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements; the ending lingers, but some concepts (xenophile, sundial) strain believability.</comment>
