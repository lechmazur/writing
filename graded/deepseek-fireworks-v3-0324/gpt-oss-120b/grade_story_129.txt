<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The troubadour's motivations and actions are deeply intertwined with his somber nature and desire to break generational curses. His use of cryptic stanzas and the tarnished ring reveal a thoughtful, layered character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the troubadour's ritualistic actions driving toward a resonant climax. The cause-and-effect logic of his method (embroidering stanzas to launch grief) is inventive yet coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned launch site is rendered with vivid, eerie sensory detail, amplifying the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone. The setting actively enhances the story's themes of transformation and empathy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, blending metaphor (the ring as a curse, the rockets as rebirth), symbolism, and a hauntingly lyrical style. The ending is both cathartic and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original, avoiding clich√©s with its unusual fusion of folklore and sci-fi elements. The metaphors (e.g., "torpedo the old grief") are fresh, and the emotional resonance feels earned, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and closure.</comment>
