<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear and desperate, but his "aloofly intimate" nature feels slightly underdeveloped. His rebellion against AI is compelling, though his minimalism could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the bard's advocacy, but the connection between the ripple study and the tide's turn feels abstract. The pacing is strong, but the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and immersive, blending ancient data with minimalist futurism. The "mundane enchantment" tone is masterfully maintained, enhancing the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the narrative, though the hidden stanza's impact could be clearer. The ending is purposeful but slightly ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion, though the "missing joker" motif risks feeling gimmicky. Avoids AI clich√©s and displays distinct style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering question about rebellion's quiet power, though the climax lacks visceral punch.</comment>
