<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation and actions align well with her coy spy persona, but her 'master of disguise' drive could be more subtly woven into her decisions beyond the coat button.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the reversed-time method and bypass action logically leading to the resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brewery's atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with sensory details (e.g., steaming amber, chilled air) enhancing the witch's enigmatic presence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (button, vial) and subtext, though the 'borrowed valor' motif slightly overpowers the ending. Theme of mending is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the witch's characterization and time-folding mechanics, but 'diabolically benevolent' feels somewhat forced in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce skillfully, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingering questions about the witch's role add depth.</comment>
