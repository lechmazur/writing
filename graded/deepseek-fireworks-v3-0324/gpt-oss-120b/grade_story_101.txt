<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Milo and Lila are well-developed, with clear motivations that align with their traits. Lila's transformation is subtly shown through her reaction to the bee pin, though Milo's "welcoming landlord" role could be more uniquely defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the parade detour and bee pin symbolism driving the narrative coherently. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "manic clarity" tone slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The studio's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (lamplight, paper scent) enhancing mood. The bee pin's connection to the setting is organic and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bee pin, weathered hearts) and layered subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of adaptation resonates deeply. Writing style elevates the story's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (bee pin as "tiny commander") are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown, not told. Minimal AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite multiple elements. Creative integration of "weathered hearts" and "adapt" stands out. Leaves a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
