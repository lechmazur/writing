<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Riven's streetwise nature and hunger are subtly woven into his actions, but his motivation to "harvest hope from darkness" lacks deeper exploration, relying heavily on the brooch's symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot moves coherently, with the brooch and temple serving clear purposes, but the resolution feels slightly rushed, and the "reversed patterns" concept could be more tightly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard temple is vividly rendered with rich sensory details, and the contrast between neon city and ancient silence enhances atmosphere, though the "unwritten calendar" could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brooch, light/darkness) and evocative prose, but the emotional resonance of Riven's unkept promise is underdeveloped, and the ending leans slightly into predictability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, avoiding clichés, though the "confident uncertainty" tone occasionally wavers into vagueness. The brooch's curse-lifting twist feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the tight word limit slightly sacrifices deeper thematic exploration. The story lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
