<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's bookishness and geographic challenge are well-integrated into her motivations and actions. Her "mournful elation" adds depth, though her assassin trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently with a clear arc. The cyclical nightmares and soothing lullabies create a satisfying cause-effect rhythm. Pacing is tight yet measured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The station’s humming atmosphere is vividly rendered, with magnetic interference and feedback loops enriching the world. Sensory details (e.g., rubber key cover’s thud) are precise and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (world as a "broken harp") and symbolism. The ending resonates with thematic depth, and the prose style elevates the story’s emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The narrative’s mournful yet hopeful tone and nuanced handling of frequency-based conflict feel fresh. Language is purposeful, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The story’s brevity amplifies its potency, leaving a lingering impression of hope amid dystopian dread.</comment>
