<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's hardheadedness and brokenness are compellingly interwoven with his motivation, creating a nuanced character arc. His actions align with his traits, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and effective pacing. The ephemeral gallery and prophecy scraps drive the narrative cohesively toward resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The gallery and snow create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "walls breathed color," "trembled like icicles") elevate the setting's connection to character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (e.g., the gallery as a mirror of identity) deepen the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of power's price could be more subtly layered.</comment>
