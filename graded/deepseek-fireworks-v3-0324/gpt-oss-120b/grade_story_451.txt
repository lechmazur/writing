<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and desperate, driving her actions. The use of actors to embody her lost twin's personality is original and revealing of her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains momentum, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The baseball's role as a catalyst is logical but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocatively rendered, with sensory details ("crystal shadows," "market bustle") enhancing atmosphere. The mountain peak and cavern are well-connected to the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (baseball, shadows) and subtext (identity as choice). The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though some phrases ("forbidden knowledge") border on generic. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the style is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers, though the apocalyptic theme could be more fully explored.</comment>
