<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Riven's motivations and traits are well-aligned, though his "philosophically practical" attribute could be more explicitly demonstrated in his actions. His voice is distinct and his use of telekinetic dice feels organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and effectively driven by the flame and dice mechanics. The arc is clear despite brevity, though the leap from gambling to agrarian preservation could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with atmospheric sensory details (humming dice, burning plasma). The tapestry and ship setting are meaningfully intertwined, enhancing the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tapestry as map, trees as lineage) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful, though the thematic depth of "sacred disorder" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases border on overly ornate ("sacred disorder settle into a practical rhythm"). Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive integration of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression of agrarian renewal in space piracy.</comment>
