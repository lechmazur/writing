<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is vividly clear and his "patiently frantic" state is deeply integrated into his actions, though his distinct "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prism's refraction driving a coherent arc from tension to revelation, though the timeframe ("during reading") feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site is hauntingly evocative, and the storm's interplay with the setting amplifies the atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "humming stones") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (bridle as scepter, prism as tool of defiance) and a cathartic ending. The theme of dismantling illusions resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("a choir of ancestors") and a striking blend of cyberpunk and mysticism avoid cliché. Only minor over-reliance on "euphoric agitation" as a descriptor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a singular vision, with the prism’s role feeling inevitable. The brevity enhances its intensity.</comment>
