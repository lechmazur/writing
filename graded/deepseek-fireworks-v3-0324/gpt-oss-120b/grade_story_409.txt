<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's internal conflict and transformation are vividly portrayed, with the inscription serving as a powerful catalyst for self-realization. The voice is distinct and resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the chisel's strike and the shard's resonance creating a coherent, symbolic arc. Pacing is sharp, though the dream abduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic's atmosphere is masterfully rendered—clockwork animals and oil-scented air deepen the thematic weight. Sensory details are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "twin breaths" of creation/destruction) and layered subtext. The ending lingers with a haunting, resolved poignancy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and imagery. The "skillfully incompetent" paradox and the dream-thread abduction are fresh, avoiding cliché. Emotional resonance is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element feels deliberate and cohesive. The brief length amplifies the story's intensity, leaving a lasting thematic imprint.</comment>
