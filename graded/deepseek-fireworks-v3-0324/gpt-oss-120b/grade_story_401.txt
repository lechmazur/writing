<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's guiltily innocent nature is compelling and drives her actions convincingly. Her motivation to mend a broken promise is clear, though her "manic clarity" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc from guilt to reconciliation. The encoded blanket method is innovative but slightly over-explained for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom setting is vividly atmospheric, enhanced by sensory details like coral-capped marble and spiraling steam. The tone contrasts beautifully with the concept of healing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ring, blanket, coffee) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the holographic forgiveness feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "time sipping coffee"). Minimal clich√©s, though the "liquid gold" simile is borderline generic. Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering meditation on forgiveness, though the crocheting skill stretches plausibility.</comment>
