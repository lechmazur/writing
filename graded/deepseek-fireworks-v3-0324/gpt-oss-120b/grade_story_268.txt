<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subdued vigilante's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, with her actions and reactions revealing depth and consistency. The wooden bead and mirror method add layers to her character, though her "artfully clumsy" trait feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the ancient martial discipline as a resolution feels earned. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition from virtual calls to the mirror's revelation could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the bead's grain, the mirror's warps) are evocative and immersive, deepening the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's literary craftsmanship is exceptional, with potent symbolism (the bead, the mirror) and a resonant theme. The ending is purposeful, and the prose avoids overtelling while delivering emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the mirror's symbolic role and the bead's dual function as talisman and compass. The tone avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("screaming silence") flirt with overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The word limit is used masterfully, leaving a lingering reflection on war's cost.</comment>
