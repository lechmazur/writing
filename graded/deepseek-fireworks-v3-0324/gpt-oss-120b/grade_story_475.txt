<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s detachment is well-integrated, but her motivation could be more nuanced. The grain of barley as a symbol is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the transition to digital. The lullaby method is inventive but underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "pixelated light like feral elegance"). Avoids clichés, though the lullaby cadence feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story, but the word limit slightly strains the emotional payoff.</comment>
