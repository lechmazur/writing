<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is poetic yet clear, and his actions align with his dark, artistic nature. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly underdeveloped in such brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the spider's web method feels abrupt. The ending resolves elegantly, though the bus driver’s role is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stellar atmospheric immersion—sensory details (gilded arches, starlight) elevate the setting. The baroque asteroid is vivid but slightly dissonant with the assassin’s grounded brutality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and potent imagery, though the theme of capturing light borders on pretentious. The ending lingers beautifully but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but phrases like "borrowed starlight" verge on overused lyricism. The assassin’s emotional depth feels slightly algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the setting’s extravagance occasionally overshadows narrative clarity. The brevity feels deliberate, not limiting.</comment>
