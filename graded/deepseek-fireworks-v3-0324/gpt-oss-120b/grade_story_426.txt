<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's "angrily peaceful" paradox and aloof passion are intriguing but could be more deeply explored to solidify her distinct voice and consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The ghost train's role as a decoder is inventive but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details (e.g., cotton candy ghosts, rattling wheels). Atmosphere perfectly supports the eerie, nostalgic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (teapot, ghost train) and layered themes (reconciliation, preservation) elevate the story. Ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dissonant lullabies"), though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clich√©s impressively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brief length feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic depth, though the prodigy's backstory could be tighter.</comment>
