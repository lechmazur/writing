<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The swordsman's hesitation and awkwardness are well-integrated into his actions and decisions, revealing depth. However, his motivation to restore tradition could be more vividly contrasted with his personal rancor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blank postcard and hermit crab metaphor driving the narrative logically toward resolution. Pacing is efficient, though the final pact's execution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frosted breath, hissing vents) enhance mood and symbolism masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (postcard as bridge, sword as sacrifice) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the emotional arc of the swordsman's transformation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The hermit crab metaphor is fresh, but some phrasing ("ephemeral rancor") leans slightly toward stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the postcard and sword sacrifice standing out as inspired choices. The brevity feels purposeful, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
