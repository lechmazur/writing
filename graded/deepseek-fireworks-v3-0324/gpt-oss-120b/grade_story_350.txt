<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The puppeteer's motivation is clear and intriguing, but his "irritatingly perfect" attribute could be more deeply integrated into his actions and decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc from discovery to revelation. The method of remodeling the album is bizarre yet fitting, though the final resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the temple and its echoes enhancing the story's mystical weight. Sensory details (scent of glue, phosphorescent moss) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor and symbolism ("symphonies of truth"). The ending resonates, though the thematic depth could be slightly more explicit. The prose is lyrical without being excessive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but the "tears in a wedding gown" method edges toward contrivance. The puppeteer's voice feels distinct, though some descriptions risk over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive and haunting vignette. The elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering impression of solitude and revelation.</comment>
