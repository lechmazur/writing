<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but could delve deeper into his internal conflicts. His "indifferent enthusiasm" is intriguing but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the transition to infiltrating secret clubs feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed but resolution lacks full impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though "quietly loud" is overused. Setting and tone complement each other perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but dialogue (via comments) feels shallow. Ending is purposeful but could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Minimal clich√©s, though some phrases ("ghostly sigh") verge on generic. Emotion is nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the brevity slightly limits depth. Lingers with a haunting tone, though not fully transformative.</comment>
