<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The curator's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his guilt and quest for repopulation are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His 'voice' is distinct, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and elegantly structured, with a clear arc despite the brevity. The road trip feels slightly forced, but the cause-and-effect logic holds. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined, with evocative sensory details. The temple and floating museum blend seamlessly, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Atmosphere deeply supports the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and literary devices, particularly the ice violin. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of 'wonder' could be more subtly woven. Emotional resonance is present but not overwhelming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. Creative combination of ideas leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
