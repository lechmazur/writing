<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's internal conflict and his "grudgingly sweet" appreciation of the cruel puzzle are vividly conveyed, though his backstory could be deeper to fully justify his sacrificial choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each action (compass, rose, lute, key) driving toward the climactic choice. Pacing is masterful for the word limit, though the mirror's rules could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and mirrored reflection create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt, honey, rusted hinges) elevate the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (compass, rose) and lyrical prose amplify the emotional weight. The ending is poignant but could linger more on the knight's transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "joyful agony" edges toward melodrama. The knight's voice and the puzzle's design avoid clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant meditation on choice and sacrifice.</comment>
