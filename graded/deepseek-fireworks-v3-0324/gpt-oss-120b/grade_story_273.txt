<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivations are clear and consistent, and his use of the yarn swift as a metaphor for truth-weaving is compelling. His "strangely honest" attribute adds depth to his defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marlowe's bottle messages driving the conflict forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The swamp fortress is vividly rendered, and its misty atmosphere enhances the story's mood of quiet rebellion. Sensory details (e.g., ghostly lanterns, murky depths) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (yarn swift, bottles) and subtext (truth as rebellion) are masterfully woven. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and AI-generic phrasing. The humble defiance tone is distinct and sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The story feels deliberate and complete, leaving a lingering impact. Creative use of constraints elevates it.</comment>
