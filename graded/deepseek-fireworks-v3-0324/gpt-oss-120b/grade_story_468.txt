<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mortician's curiosity and polite anarchy are vivid and drive his actions, though his backstory is sparse. His motivation is clear and aligned with his traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a clear arc from entry to resolution. The concept of collecting dream journals is absurd yet compellingly executed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (amber glow, rustling) deepen the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (bracelet, footprints) and subtext (rebellion of silence). The ending is satisfying, and the prose elevates the story beyond its surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The language is fresh ("polite anarchy," "loudly serene"), and the emotional resonance is subtle yet potent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
