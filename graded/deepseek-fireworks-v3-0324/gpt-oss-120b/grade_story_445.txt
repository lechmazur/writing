<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The nomad's transformation from sleepy wanderer to vigilant pilgrim is compelling, though his initial motivation could be sharper. The barbells as a metaphor for arrogance is well-executed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, but the room's disappearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty highlands and disguise room are vividly rendered, blending fantasy and practicality. Sensory details (vines, humming barbells) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (barbells, cloak) and layered themes elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the dialogue with Lira could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with few clich√©s. The "spiritually material" concept is fresh, though some phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically into a haunting, cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
