<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation and actions are clear, but her "impersonally personal" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her rebellion against conformity is compelling, though slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphorical propulsion. The connection between folklore analysis and zipper repair is inventive but tenuous in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details enhancing the story's mood. The setting and object (zipper pull) are meaningfully linked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with lingering thematic resonance. The brevity feels deliberate, though some elements (folklore analysis) could be more integrated.</comment>
