<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fainthearted sentinel's fear and gradual resolve are well-articulated, but his motivation could be more deeply explored. The ruler as a symbol of measurement is effective, yet his internal voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The tapestry method is inventive but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chamber's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the "intimately distant" air feels slightly overwrought. The setting enhances the concept of illusion beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though some metaphors (e.g., "tide") are generic. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with minimal clich√©s. The ruler's symbolism feels fresh, but the dog's role borders on trope. Nuanced handling of fear and curiosity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the tapestry's centrality slightly strains believability. Leaves a lingering thematic question about security and knowledge.</comment>
