<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin's "spineless" nature contrasts intriguingly with his rare gift for mentorship, creating nuanced tension. His motivation to hush the prophecy aligns with his cartographic background and fear of battle, though his internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the prophecy's code and the dollhouse key driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the apprentice's sudden appearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly rendered with sensory details (vellum, oil, constellations) that enhance the mystical atmosphere. The "hush after the wind" amplifies the tension, though the blue-ink scroll's pulsing could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key as conduit, maps as stories) and subtext (rewriting fate through quiet rebellion) elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, but the "luminous doubt" metaphor slightly overstays its welcome.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "spineless mercenary" risks being a gimmick. The Victorian dollhouse key is a fresh, unexpected anchor. Some phrases ("grandly trivial") border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on mentorship and destiny.</comment>
