<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the power outage and radiant shifts driving momentum logically. The resolution feels earned but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—pine, old paper, and flickering shards create vivid immersion. The tree-ring room and zephyr enhance the mystical tone brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lunchbox as compass, mirrors as motives) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the theme could be subtly reinforced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("luminous shards," "scarred past") avoid cliché. The illusionist's defiance feels organic, and the prose avoids purple excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize seamlessly, with the lunchbox and zephyr amplifying the theme. The word limit feels intentional, leaving room for resonance.</comment>
