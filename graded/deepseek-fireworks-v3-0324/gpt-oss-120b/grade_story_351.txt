<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s dreamy and rebellious nature is well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her "formally rebellious" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated beyond her verses.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the sundial and letter seamlessly driving the narrative toward a coherent and satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ivy-clad station and sundial create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, light, touch) elevate the setting to a character in itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sundial, seal, shadows) and lyrical prose make the story resonate. The ending lingers, though the theme of "delicate undoing" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases ("poet’s sigh") edge toward cliché. The voice is distinct, but a few transitions feel slightly algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements harmonize beautifully; the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a haunting question: who were the unremembered? A standout micro-fiction.</comment>
