<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lovelorn spy's motivation is clear but slightly inconsistent; his emotional void vs. thrill of survival feels disjointed. Mara's indifferent shrug adds depth but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot drives forward well, but the avalanche climax feels abrupt. The sticky label's transformation into a beacon is clever but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (neon-lit alleys, nanospice broth) immerse the reader. The derelict data hub and slums enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (label as talisman) and memorable prose, but the ending’s hope feels slightly unearned. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (shards of destiny) and originality in worldbuilding stand out. Minimal clichés, though the spy’s duality borders on tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the length strains coherence. The broth’s prophetic taste lingers as a highlight.</comment>
