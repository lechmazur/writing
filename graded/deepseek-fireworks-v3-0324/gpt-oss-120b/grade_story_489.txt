<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but their "aggressively kind" attribute feels underdeveloped and somewhat forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a clear arc connecting the whale's call, the whistle, and the lighthouse's revival. However, the dancer’s introduction feels slightly tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and atmospheric details (e.g., phosphorescent algae, fog) are vividly rendered, creating a haunting, immersive mood. The whale’s call and lighthouse beam enhance the eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as talisman, lantern as revival) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant but slightly abstract, leaving some thematic threads unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in its surreal blending of sea and stage, but the "aggressively kind" phrasing and some metaphors (e.g., "wisdom flows beneath storms") edge toward generic profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the whistle and whale’s call serving as unexpected yet fitting catalysts. The brevity feels intentional, though the dancer’s role could be sharper.</comment>
