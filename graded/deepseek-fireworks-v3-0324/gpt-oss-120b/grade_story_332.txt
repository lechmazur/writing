<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is subtly conveyed but deeply rooted in the garden's decay and her artistic resolve. Her "fiercely gentle" nature is reflected in her actions, though her solitude could be explored with more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive, with resuscitation as the driving force, but the transition from confessions to resuscitation feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered with sensory details (phosphorescent vines, luminescent silk), and the atmosphere amplifies Mara's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink that never dries, constellations) elevates the story. The ending is poignant but risks being overly sentimental. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("palette of colors that sighed") and fresh emotional resonance avoid clich√©s. Only minor overuse of "whispered" motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize beautifully, leaving a haunting impression. The brevity feels intentional, amplifying the theme of fragile renewal.</comment>
