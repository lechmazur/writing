<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The diplomat's motivation and layered personality are clear, and his interactions with the tassel reveal nuanced traits. His measured demeanor and moral dilemma are well-integrated, though his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the genetic decoding premise drives the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the drum circles could be more organically woven into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The forgotten city hall is vividly rendered, and sensory details (dust, musty scent) deepen immersion. The setting enhances the story's tension, though the drum circles feel slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tassel as cipher) and subtext (revenge vs. preservation). The ending is poignant, and the theme resonates. Literary craft elevates the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of sci-fi and diplomatic intrigue. No clich√©s, though the "abrasive calm" phrasing feels slightly overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story masterfully. The brevity enhances impact, leaving a lingering question about moral costs. A standout piece.</comment>
