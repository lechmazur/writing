<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's sarcastic yet secretly earnest motivation is well-developed, and her actions align with her "perfectly flawed" ambition. Her distinct voice shines, though her background as a librarian feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions (e.g., the vortex reveal). The lentil stew subplot adds whimsy but slightly detracts from the central tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (cumin, chilies, pulsing metal) enhancing the mythic tone. The portals and carvings feel organic, though the "silent watchers" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of irony and subtext (mocking sincerity, humility as legend). The ending is satisfying, but the theme of shared meals vs. stolen glory occasionally overshadows the graver stakes of "harvesting grace."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh twists on tropes (e.g., the tag’s true power) and a distinctive voice elevate this. Minor AI-like quirks: "grin that tasted like sarcasm" leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the lentil stew motif feels whimsical for the weighty themes. The brevity serves the story’s tight focus on Mara’s paradox.</comment>
