<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's "underestimated rebel" trait is well-integrated, and her motivation to awaken wonder is clear, though her "sadly joyful" grin could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ramen and carousel serving as strong symbols of adaptation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, with sensory details (soy scent, cracked mirrors) enhancing the ephemeral gloom. A standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (knife as adaptation, ramen as love), evocative prose, and a resonant ending elevate this beyond typical genre fare.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Only minor nitpicks: the "ring of a call" feels slightly forced, and some metaphors verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
