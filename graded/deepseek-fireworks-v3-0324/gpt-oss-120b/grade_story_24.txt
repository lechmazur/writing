<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard’s character is vividly drawn, his motivations clear and poetic, but his "meandering" nature could be more sharply defined against his urgent mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the bookstore and the bars feels tenuous—more thematic than causal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with the bookstore-mountain and seedy bars creating a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative storytelling with strong symbolism, though the ending’s callback to the apologetic text slightly disrupts the mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original, but the "fractured idyll" tone occasionally clashes with the warmth motif, and some phrases edge toward over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story excels in cohesion and creativity, though the bookstore setting feels underutilized for the bard’s pivotal actions.</comment>
