<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong character development with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in transformation. The prepper's use of the ink blotter reveals his shift from planner to prophet, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the ink blotter's power, though the transition to the subterranean chamber feels slightly rushed. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere with evocative sensory details (e.g., "scent of centuries"). The temple setting amplifies the story's mystical tension and the character's resolve.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ink as resolve, stars as destiny) and a satisfying arc. The theme of rebirth is layered, though the ending's vow feels slightly overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "unstitched from their celestial loom"). Some phrases border on ornate, but the emotional resonance is genuine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive despite multiple elements. The brevity serves the story well, leaving a lingering sense of defiance and reinvention.</comment>
