<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The solemn orchardist’s reverent precision and Mara’s endearingly irritating chatter are vividly drawn, with clear motivation to find connection. Their interactions reveal depth, though Mara’s backstory could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the key and seeds driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the brother’s reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk garden is immersive and contrasts beautifully with the city’s chaos. Sensory details (humming nanites, neon vines) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (key, seeds) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is poignant, and the theme of connection is expertly shown, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered gem. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope. Elements serve the story, not vice versa.</comment>
