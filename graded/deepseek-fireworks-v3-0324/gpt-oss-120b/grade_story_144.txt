<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a weary chef seeking to bridge gaps through food is clear and compelling, though her emotional depth could be further explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arcs neatly from fair to flume, but the transition to the amusement park feels slightly abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing tightens in the second half.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (glowing broth, cold water) enhance the eerie yet hopeful atmosphere. The haunted park and street fair contrast effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (music box as hope) and subtext (unity through shared nourishment). The ending satisfies, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh imagery (nebulae-like herbs). Avoids clich√©s, but "calm frenzy" feels slightly forced. Emotional resonance is nuanced and shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well for such brevity. The story lingers due to its thematic depth, though the log flume setting slightly strains logic.</comment>
