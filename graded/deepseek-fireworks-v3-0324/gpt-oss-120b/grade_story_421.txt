<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the intervention driving the narrative forward logically. The connection between the wheel's tide and the garden's revival is inventive yet clear.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (petals, iron hum, scent of earth and ink), and the workshop setting enhances the mystical tone. The garden's significance is seamlessly woven in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the wheel, pressed flowers as prayers) are masterfully employed. The emotional resonance is potent, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the mariner's wheel's forgotten tide and the "ferociously polite" dynamic. Nuanced emotions ("anguished joy") avoid clich√©, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>
