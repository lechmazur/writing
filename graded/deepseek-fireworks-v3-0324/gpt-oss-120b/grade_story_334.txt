<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlen's character is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his "artificially authentic" smile could be explored deeper. His conflicting loyalties drive the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the spinning top and stolen glimpses driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting and magnetic atmosphere are richly immersive, enhancing the story's tension and thematic depth. Sensory details (humming, copper whorls) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (thunder as a commodity) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open, leaving room for contemplation. Literary devices are used with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clich√©s. The spinning top as a conduit and the "gods of mediocrity" concept feel fresh. Minor stiffness in Arlen's internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, high-impact story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, and the thematic resonance lingers.</comment>
