<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The peddler's motivation is clear and consistent, with his meek assertiveness and redemption quest well-incorporated. His actions reveal depth, though his distinct "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, with a logical progression from oath-breaking to redemption. Pacing is effective, though the serum's discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (brittle flowers, luminescent serum) enhancing the abandoned station's melancholy. Setting and object intertwine beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flowers, serum) and subtext (silence vs. truth). Ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (flowers as "silent witnesses"). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on overly poetic without substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic exploration.</comment>
