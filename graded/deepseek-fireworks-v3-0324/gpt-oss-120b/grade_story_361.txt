<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation is clear and consistent, though his "mild-mannered" trait could be more vividly shown in action. His mechanical intuition and connection to indigenous knowledge are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from diner to schoolhouse feels abrupt. The dice as a key device is clever but could be tightened.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner and "organized disorder" are vividly rendered, though the schoolhouse setting lacks equal sensory detail. Atmosphere enhances the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, equations) and emotional resonance, but the ending's thematic punch could be sharper. Subtext about reclaiming knowledge is powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing ("heart hammered like a piston") verges on predictable. The fusion of indigenous knowledge and tech feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the diner/schoolhouse dichotomy slightly fractures focus. Leaves a lingering question about cultural preservation.</comment>
