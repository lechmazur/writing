<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is coherent, but the resolution ("cracking the seal of cosmic hush") feels abrupt, lacking deeper foreshadowing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the brevity forces certain themes (sacrifice, renewal) to be stated rather than explored.</comment>
