<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her actions, but her "restless" trait could be more vividly shown through physical or emotional restlessness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the conjurer's goal, though the road closure feels slightly contrived. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The luminous cave setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's magical atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing pearls, floating lanterns) are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (pearls as memory, blank card as potential) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "sigil summoning a tide of ideas"). Avoids clich√©s, though "layered tranquility" feels overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity serves the story well. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though the detour's impact could be deeper.</comment>
