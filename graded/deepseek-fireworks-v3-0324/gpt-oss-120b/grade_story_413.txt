<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The noble's transformation from listlessness to purpose is subtly but effectively executed, though his naivety could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot flows seamlessly from ennui to revelation, with tight cause-and-effect logic. The word limit is mastered, but the resolution edges on abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exquisiteâ€”haunted plain and corn maze merge into a liminal dreamscape. Sensory details (flickering lantern, whispering stalks) are lush yet precise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scarf as relic, laughter as pulse) elevates the prose. Ending resonates, though the theme of intention slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and haunting, with fresh metaphors (stalks as "ghosts of future beasts"). Only flaw: "naively sophisticated" verges on contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A near-flawless microcosm of literary craft. Elements coalesce into mythic weight; only the scarf's vibration feels slightly overdone.</comment>
