<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, fierce, and consistent with her poetically rational nature. Her actions align well with her desire to dismantle the political elite's control, and her distinct voice emerges through the lyrical coding of stanzas.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the corrosion of falsehoods driving the narrative. The connection between beginning and end is clear, and the pacing is excellent for the word limit. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical and compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The underground orchard's bio-luminescent fungus is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the action. Sensory details (glowing fungus, corroding wood, shifting sand) immerse the reader and amplify the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) and subtext, the story evokes thought and emotion. The ending is purposeful, and the writing style enhances the impact. Conflict and theme are clear and resolved effectively.</comment>
