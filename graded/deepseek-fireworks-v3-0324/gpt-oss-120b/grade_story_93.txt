<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her 'voice' could be more distinct given the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a satisfying arc despite constraints. The pirate radio method is inventive but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (fluttering cards, resonant signals) elevating the setting's tension and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cards as bonds, archive as mandala) and a resonant ending. Theme of unspoken bonds is subtly powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "signal curled like a spiral"). Avoids clich√©s, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, and the story lingers with thematic depth. Word limit feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
