<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's dual nature as a faux fortune teller with genuine visions is compelling, and their motivation to reconcile their persona with their true gift is clear and consistent. However, the "peaceful anger" could be more deeply explored to enhance nuance.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. The connection between the flute, visions, and language revival is logical, though the crypt's discovery could feel slightly contrived.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The extinct language archive and hidden garden create a rich, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the humming earth and whispering vines immerse the reader, though the "planting seasons" motif could be more integrated.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craftsmanship, using symbolism (flute as conduit) and subtext (authenticity vs. performance). The ending is satisfying, though the scholarly offering could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "seedlings pushing through cracked stone"). Avoids clich√©s, but the "peaceful anger" duality verges on over-familiarity. The voice is distinctive and purposeful.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on chance and authenticity.</comment>
