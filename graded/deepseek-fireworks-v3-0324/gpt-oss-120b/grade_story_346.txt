<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The warrior's boastfulness and hubris are vividly portrayed, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The lint-filled pocket is a unique touch that reveals his self-deception well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the balloon pops and hive mind creating a rhythmic tension. The ending resolves cleanly, though the warrior's realization could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasp nest's humid, amber-lit corridors and pulsing walls are masterfully described. The atmosphere heightens the surreal, fabricated reality theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lint as lies, balloons as illusions) and electric prose elevate this. The ending's stark white void lingers as a brilliant contrast.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("metronome of hubris") and surprising twists (wasps debating stings) defy clich√©s. Only minor stiffness in soliloquies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The pocket's glow as a compass is a standout detail that resonates beyond the narrative.</comment>
