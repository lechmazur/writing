<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The knight's earnestness and his quiet, determined motivation are clear and consistent. His connection to the map and the stars reveals depth, though his "voice" is subdued due to limited dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect logic is strong, with the greenhouse tears and celestial alignment driving the resolution. Pacing is tight yet organic, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—the aqueduct, desert, and greenhouse are richly rendered with sensory details (cracked glass, burning sage). The setting amplifies the knight’s quest and the theme of thawing sterility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (constellations as tears, fire as hope) and a layered theme of renewal. The ending resonates, though the "canvas of life" metaphor slightly overextends.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The greenhouse mapping is inventive, though "crisp nostalgia" borders on overused. Emotional nuance is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering hope. Minor deduct for the greenhouse method’s slight contrivance.</comment>
