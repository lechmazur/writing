<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's borderline immortality and bitter laughter lend depth, though his motivation to restore the ecosystem could be more explicitly tied to his longevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs elegantly from decay to rebirth, with ink patterns and particle accelerators driving the resolution. Pacing is tight yet organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite fusion of sci-fi and pastoral decay: the garden’s thrumming vines and phosphorescent night immerse the reader in a haunting, original world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("ink like liquid starlight") and a melancholic yet inventive voice avoid cliché. Only minor stiffness in the keeper’s laughter.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s core; the length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of resilience.</comment>
