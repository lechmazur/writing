<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marlo's motivation is clear and aligns with his creative block, but his "secret" feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions are consistent, yet his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the coral reef texture cleverly ties the resolution to the conflict. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes Varek's entrance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion with vivid sensory details. The steampunk lounge and coral-textured gauntlet enhance mood and character motivation seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and symbolism; the gauntlet's transformation is hauntingly effective. Emotional resonance is high, and the ending lingers. Some metaphors border on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the coral reef metaphor risks over-poeticism. Nuanced handling of emotion, but Marlo's "block" could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Elements serve the story, and the ending leaves a resonant question about fragile truces. Minor stylistic excesses.</comment>
