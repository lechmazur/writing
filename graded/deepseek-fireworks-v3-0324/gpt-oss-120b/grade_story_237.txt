<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, with dice rolls and diary fragments logically guiding the resolution, though the pace feels slightly rushed in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "pages fluttering like moths in zero gravity") and an original premise elevate the story beyond tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the brevity slightly undermines thematic depth. The ending leaves a quiet but not lingering resonance.</comment>
