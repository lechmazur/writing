<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The astronomer's motivation is clear and distinct, though his "rationally organic" mind feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his goal of toppling the fear idol, revealing his resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, with a clear arc, but the snowflake-toppling-idol logic stretches plausibility slightly. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes create a haunting, vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "liquid moon," "trembling stone") immerse the reader deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the "last human emotion" motif risks feeling overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("crystal shadows like lace") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s and formulaic phrasing convincingly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The story lingers, though the snowflake-idol connection feels slightly contrived for the theme.</comment>
