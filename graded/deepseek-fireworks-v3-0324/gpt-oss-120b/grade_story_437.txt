<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration. His "spineless" nature is underutilized, reducing potential complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels somewhat static. The blurring boundaries concept drives the narrative, though pacing lags in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details (acid rain, neon flicker) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (owl, tears) and subtext, but the ending's hope feels unearned. Literary craft shines, though emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar dystopian tropes. Some phrases verge on purple prose, though the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s brevity limits thematic depth. A lingering, melancholic mood is its strongest asset.</comment>
