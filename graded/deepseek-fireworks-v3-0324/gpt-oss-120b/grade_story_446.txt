<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "amiable gambler" trait feels underutilized in favor of her deeper obsession with the ledger. Her actions align well with her goal, but her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. The charity drives and ledger entries logically drive the story forward, though the "hydrolyze" metaphor occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds and moonflower petals create a lush, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the ledger's glow and the petals' descent enrich the world and amplify the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ledger as a seed, fireflies as witnesses) and subtext (quiet rebellion vs. tyranny). The ending is satisfying, though the "peaceful anger" tone could be more consistently woven into the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "art of unbecoming" concept is inventive, though the "hydrolyze" metaphor risks feeling overly poetic. Emotional resonance is achieved through subtlety, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope. The brevity feels deliberate, and the firefly-lit resolution is both vivid and thematically resonant.</comment>
