<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dr. Mara Voss's motivation is clear and compelling, blending dire enchantment with scholarly pursuit. Her actions and the cutlass's role reveal her determination and mysticism, though her "bleary-eyed" trait is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cutlass as both literal and symbolic key. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "digital nomad camp" feels slightly underdeveloped in the narrative flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with the horizon's edge and temple’s basalt heart enhancing the eerie, magical tone. Sensory details (coffee grounds, humming cutlass) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Superb use of symbolism (cutlass as compass, coffee grounds as maps) and subtext (unfinished tales as personal redemption). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original execution, avoiding clichés. The coffee-ground divination and pirate-cutlass hybrid feel fresh. Nuanced emotional layering elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery and thematic depth.</comment>
