<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong character arcs with clear motivations, though the prince's exile could be more deeply explored. The herbalist's mute desperation is poignant but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively with a satisfying arc. The snowstorm-driven encounter feels organic, and the resolution resonates. Minor pacing quibbles in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the customs office and storm are vividly rendered. Dust spirals and ghostly ribbons elevate the sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with potent symbolism (mortar as key, vapor as connection). Ending lingers with thematic weight, though the "unseen forces" could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh take on isolation and shared purpose. Some phrases edge toward predictability ("hollow echo"), but the core metaphor is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements harmonize elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for resonance. A standout in constrained storytelling.</comment>
