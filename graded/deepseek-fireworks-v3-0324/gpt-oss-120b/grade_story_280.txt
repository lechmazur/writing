<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's character is vividly drawn, with her "sweetly confrontational" demeanor and strategic mindset clearly driving her actions. Her motivation to master strategy through unconventional means is consistent and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Lira's observation of tracks and interaction with the bear forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, and cause-effect relationships are logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icy tundra and quasar observation deck create a striking, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (brass cups reflecting constellations, honey’s scent) enhance the world’s richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using metaphors (honey as mixed blessing, kneading strategy like dough) and symbolism (quasars as omens) to deepen impact. The ending is resonant and thematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of cosmic and earthly elements feels fresh, and emotions are shown through nuanced actions (e.g., offering honey while shifting cups).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of harmony between micro and macro scales.</comment>
