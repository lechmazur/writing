<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, but the "plant whisperer" aspect feels slightly underdeveloped—more could be shown of her connection to plants beyond functional vines.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc. The constrained word limit forces efficiency, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, blending mechanical and organic elements seamlessly. Sensory details (e.g., broken violin, humming gears) enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shoelace, vines, violin) and subtext. Ending resonates, though the "test of faith" theme could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Some phrases verge on overly ornate, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though "singularly multiple" feels abstract. The length suits the story’s ambition and leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
