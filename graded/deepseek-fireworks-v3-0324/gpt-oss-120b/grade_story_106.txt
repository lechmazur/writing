<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The farmer’s sullenness and transformation are well-rendered, but his motivation to abandon farming feels abrupt, lacking deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot coheres around the quilt’s symbolic power, though the mystical resolution risks feeling unearned. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly atmospheric, merging decay and hope. Sensory details (humming pressure, rust) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as passports, quilt as map) and lyrical prose compensate for a slightly rushed emotional arc. Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original juxtaposition of elements (quilt, stamps, underwater ruin) avoids cliché. Nuanced handling of "borrowed valor" stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically, though the farm’s dead-end backstory could be sharper. Length feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
