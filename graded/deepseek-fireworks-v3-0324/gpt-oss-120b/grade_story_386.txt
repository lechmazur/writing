<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and poetically aligned with his role as a time refugee, though his 'voice' remains somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and elegantly paced, with the catapult's firing serving as a resonant climax. Minor tension could be heightened earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its atom-powered core create a mesmerizing, tactile atmosphere. Sensory details (humming core, luminous threads) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (constellations as maps, grief as light) and a hauntingly satisfying ending. Subtext about memory and redemption elevates it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though "borrowed dawn" edges toward poetic cliché. The catapult’s purpose is brilliantly fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that feels deliberate in its brevity. Leaves the reader with lingering awe for its mythic scale.</comment>
