<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The troubadour's motivation is clear and his actions align with his melancholic, introspective nature. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more dialogue could deepen his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from grief to acceptance. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—sensory details (humming walls, star trails) immerse the reader. The echo chamber setting enhances the theme of reverberating memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (constellations, void) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of forgiveness could be more subtly woven in earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with all elements serving the story. The brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of quiet resolution.</comment>
