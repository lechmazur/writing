<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The warlock's motivation is compelling and consistent, but his 'voice' could be more distinct. His hunger for knowledge is vividly portrayed, though some actions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The fragment and cure drive the story logically, but the ending's ambiguity slightly weakens resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details (dust, iron, ink) enhancing immersion. The mine-library setting is brilliantly utilized, though the timeframe feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful but could resonate more emotionally. Writing style is polished but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The warlock's paradox of certainty is nuanced, though some phrases edge toward purple prose. The concept of 'optimized hunger' is ingenious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story, with creative combinations. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about knowledge's cost. Minor stylistic excesses slightly hinder clarity.</comment>
