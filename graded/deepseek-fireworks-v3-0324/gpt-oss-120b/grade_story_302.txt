<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear (to tame chaos with his manuscript) and his actions align with his "fiercely nonchalant" demeanor. However, his "tuneless" aspect feels underutilized beyond surface description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly paced and logically coherent, with the manuscript’s ignition resolving the external chaos while revealing the bard’s humility. Minor deduction for abrupt transition from terror to applause.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere: steampunk details (brass, copper pipes) merge seamlessly with the manuscript’s chaos, and sensory immersion (flickering chandeliers, humming engines) elevates the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as chaos, filament as order) and a resonant ending. Slight overreliance on metaphor ("serpent that fed on pressure") disrupts clarity at points.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh and original, with no clichés. The "brazen humility" concept is nuanced, though the phrase itself teeters on purple prose. The bard’s voice feels distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful vignette. Elements serve the story, and the length feels intentional. Lingers on the tension between chaos and artistry.</comment>
