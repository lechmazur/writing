<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's whimsical nature and motivation to chronicle environmental changes are well-aligned and consistent, though her mechanical aspects could use deeper exploration for full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the artist’s brushstroke as a pivotal moment that ties environmental decay to creativity, though the fortune-tellers' role could be more organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace setting is breathtakingly original and richly atmospheric, with sensory details (singing thermometer, glowing vials) enhancing the story’s melancholic beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite use of metaphor (brass heart rusting, glass vials as moments) and subtext (art vs. entropy), though the fortune-tellers’ predictions occasionally feel more decorative than essential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice with fresh imagery, though some phrases ("practical illusion") verge on repetitive. Avoids clichés but could deepen emotional nuance in Lira’s confrontation with mortality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting narrative where every element serves the theme of transience. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering meditation on art and decay.</comment>
