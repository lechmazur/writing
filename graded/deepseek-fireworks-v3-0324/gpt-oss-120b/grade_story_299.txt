<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her rational rebellion and connection to the amber brooch adding depth. However, her "unsure champion" attribute could be more explicitly woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively, with Mara's actions driving the narrative. The word limit is well-managed, but the climax (the midnight walk) could be slightly more developed for impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chalk cliff setting and "cheerful gloom" tone are vividly rendered, enhancing atmosphere. Sensory details (resin glow, bells) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (symbolism of the brooch, tapestry metaphor) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "imperfect love" could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. Some phrases ("patchwork of doubts") edge toward formulaic, but the overall voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The brevity works, though a hint of Mara's internal conflict earlier could deepen the arc.</comment>
