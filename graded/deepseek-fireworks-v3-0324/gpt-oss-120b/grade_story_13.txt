<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The swordsman's solemnity and fixation on the box are clear, but his motivation to track evolutionary changes feels slightly abstract for his archetype. His actions align well, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and paced well, but the connection between poems and evolutionary shifts could be tighter. Sand-erased footprints are a strong device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere—amber vapors, rusted hinges, and shifting sands create vivid immersion. The laboratory and garden are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (spiral evolution, dysfunction as purpose), but the ending's "mild fervor" feels understated for the stakes. Craft is otherwise polished.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The box's "functional dysfunction" and garden’s coded leaves are fresh. Some phrases verge on ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the swordsman's role slightly strains believability. The story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
