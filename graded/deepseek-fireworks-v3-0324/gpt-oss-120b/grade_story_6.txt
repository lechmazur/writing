<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with a clear arc, though the resolution with the trickster could be more nuanced. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly; length feels deliberate. Lingers with thematic depth and inventive worldbuilding.</comment>
