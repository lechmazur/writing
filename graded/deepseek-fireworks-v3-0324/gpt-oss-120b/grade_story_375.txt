<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The smiling saboteur's motivation is clear and poetic, aligning well with her reverence for imperfection. Her actions and reactions to objects (flashlight, mannequins) reveal depth, though her 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and coherent, with the star's wrath driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the mannequins' role feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is superb—the abandoned tower and gorge create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked porcelain, rusted panels) immerse the reader flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (flashlight as broken promise) and thematic depth. The ending is resonant and lingers. Literary devices elevate the prose without feeling forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The star’s wrath and mannequins are fresh twists. Prose is vivid but never purple, with nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly, serving the story’s theme. The length feels intentional, leaving a thought-provoking impression of redemption through flaw.</comment>
