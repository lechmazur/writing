<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is vividly clear and drives the narrative with a distinct, rebellious voice. The scribe's actions align perfectly with their mission, revealing depth through their interaction with the mask and the labyrinth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mask and organ chamber serving as organic drivers. The revolution's rumble escalates logically, and the ending delivers a satisfying resolution without feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world is breathtakingly immersive—evocative sensory details (dust, humming pipes) merge with the setting to amplify tension and mood. The bookshelf-as-labyrinth metaphor is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story thrums with layered symbolism (mask as rebellion, verses as seeds). Its lyrical prose and subtext about art's power make it emotionally resonant and thematically rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés through fresh metaphors (e.g., "glass rains down reflecting endings"). The rebellious tone and vivid imagery feel uniquely human, not AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving the reader with lingering questions about art and resistance.</comment>
