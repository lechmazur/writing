<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lieutenant Mara's seasickness and naval background provide a compelling contrast to her resolve, but her "awkwardly charming" attribute feels underutilized in shaping her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect logic, though the moon-phase tracking method feels slightly rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., the mirror's "restless tide") enhancing the ethereal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the orchid, the mirror) and a resonant ending elevate the story, though the theme of "traded secrets" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "the bulb’s core" as a lunar record). Minimal cliché reliance, though the "nostalgic defiance" tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the brevity feeling intentional. The ghost orchid’s transformation is particularly ingenious, though the rainbow canyon’s role could be sharper.</comment>
