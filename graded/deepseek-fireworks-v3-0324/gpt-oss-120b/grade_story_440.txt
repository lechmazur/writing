<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swordsman's "lovingly detached" nature is subtly woven into his actions, but his motivation—binding sea to steel—could be more explicitly explored to deepen his resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured around the vow's fulfillment, though the "secret weavers" could be more integrated into the climax to solidify their role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building excels with sensory details (neon, polymer hum) and a striking fusion of oceanic and urban mythos. The recycling center feels vital, not just decorative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sea pottery as memory, neon as redemption) and a hauntingly playful tone elevate the narrative. The ending’s ripple effect is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("quiet tide that never touched the shore") and a subversion of swordsman tropes showcase originality. No AI clichés detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that feels intentionally brief yet complete. The vow’s impossibility and resolution linger brilliantly.</comment>
