<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apathetic summoner's transformation from indifference to quiet resolve is subtle but effectively conveyed. His "enthusiastically lazy" attribute feels unique, though his motivation to rebuild coral reefs could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the river's wisdom and the coffee grinder driving the narrative smoothly. The ending resolves the arc satisfyingly within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shared dream recording studio and the dying god's breath create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (coffee aroma, river whispers) are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich use of symbolism (empty frames, luminous minnows) and subtext (apathetic creation vs. patient rebuilding). The ending lingers with emotional and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of indifference, ecological purpose, and dreamlike mechanics feels fresh. Language is vivid but purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with all elements serving its themes. The brief length enhances its poetic intensity rather than limiting depth.</comment>
