<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's headstrong nature and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His love for Lira adds depth but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a satisfying arc, though the pacing is tight. The connection between glitter and confession is original but risks slight abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms are vividly rendered, creating a haunting yet hopeful atmosphere. Sensory details (amber light, crackling record) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stained glass, glitter) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant, though the "merry bitterness" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. Some phrasing borders on ornate, but the glitter-as-hope metaphor feels fresh. Lira’s laughter coaxing blossoms is a highlight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity works, though deeper exploration of Arlen’s doubt could strengthen thematic impact.</comment>
