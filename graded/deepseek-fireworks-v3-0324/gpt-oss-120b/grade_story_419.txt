<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin’s no-nonsense empathy is compelling, but his blacksmith role feels slightly underutilized. Motivation is clear, but deeper exploration of his internal conflict would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution leans slightly too neat for the haunting premise. The heartbeat rhythm ties everything together elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immaculate—haunting, vivid, and deeply immersive. The dollhouse museum and stained glass ornament synergize perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism and emotional resonance, though the ending’s hopeful tone slightly undercuts the story’s eerie potential. Literary craft is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, but a few phrases ("dying star," "tapestry of preserved traditions") edge toward cliché. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors dominate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the story’s brevity hints at untapped depth. A lingering, melancholic impact compensates.</comment>
