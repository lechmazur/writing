<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a wanderer is clear, but Finn's "pleasantly troublesome" nature feels underdeveloped. Their dynamic is engaging but could use more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the dance-to-barricade transition feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the climax lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. A standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (scrimshaw, light) and emotional resonance. Ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original setting and fresh metaphors, though Finn's dialogue occasionally veers into clich√©. Avoids AI tropes well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively, but the dance class feels contrived. Leaves a lingering thematic impression.</comment>
