<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his role as a preserver of memories, though his "literally unique" attribute could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coin-toss method driving a coherent arc from isolation to purpose. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, fluttering pamphlet) amplifying the melancholic atmosphere. A near-perfect fusion of setting and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (coin as heartbeat, melodies as memory) and a hauntingly resonant ending elevate this beyond surface narrative. Minor deduction for slightly overstated emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though the "simulated reality" motif risks feeling trendy. The coin-toss method is strikingly fresh, but some phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that lingers. The brevity feels intentional, with each element serving the theme of remembrance.</comment>
