<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Felix's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "lucky gambler" trait feels underutilized. His botanical diary and method of spin-the-bottle confessions reveal depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the spin-the-bottle method feels contrived. Pacing is effective, though the corruption of power concept is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and ghost town setting are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. Atmosphere enhances the theme of hope in decay, though the "unremembered future" timeframe is vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (e.g., the diary). The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict (corruption of power) lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of spin-the-bottle confessions, but some phrases feel slightly formulaic. Emotional nuance is present, though the tone wobbles between cheerful and despairing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but some elements (like the gambler trait) feel tacked on. The length works, though the theme could be sharper.</comment>
