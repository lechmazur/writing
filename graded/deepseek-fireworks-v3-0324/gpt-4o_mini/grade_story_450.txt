<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sharp-wittedness and dancer background subtly inform her introspection, but her motivation to break denial is clear and compelling. Her actions align well with her emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the family photo tradition and spaceship patch driving the narrative toward a satisfying resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "thought experiment chamber" feels underutilized, but the bubble bath setting enhances introspection. Sensory details (bubbles, patch texture) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bubbles as denial, patch as hope), layered subtext, and a resonant ending. The prose elevates the emotional weight without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original handling of grief and denial, avoiding clich√©s. Nuanced emotions and fresh metaphors (e.g., "bubbles of the bath now a distant memory").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a poignant whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
