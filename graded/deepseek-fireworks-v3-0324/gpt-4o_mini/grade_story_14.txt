<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's naive gambler persona is well-established, but his transition from hope to realization feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly hampers the pacing of Leo's epiphany. The candle mold's role as a catalyst is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station and candlelit dinners create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (wax, salty air) enhance the mood, though the dock's presence is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle as hope) and subtext (bargains with self) are strong, but the professors' lectures, while intriguing, distract slightly from Leo's core conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, though the "laughing tears" tone wobbles. Leo's emotional arc feels authentic, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the dock and lectures feel tangential. The ending lingers, but the word limit strains thematic depth.</comment>
