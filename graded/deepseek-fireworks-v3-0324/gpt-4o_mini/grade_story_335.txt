<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jax's shaky demeanor and amber obsession create a compelling, flawed protagonist, though his mercenary background feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on tropes (hidden truth, cryptic artist). Pacing is strong, but the resolution is somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-turned-haven is vividly rendered, with murals and decay amplifying Jax's internal conflict. Sensory details are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber, spider) is potent, and the ending resonates. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Theme of self-discovery is clear but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality suffers from familiar tropes (tortured mercenary, mystical quest). Prose avoids clich√©s but lacks stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the story feels like a polished vignette rather than a fully realized narrative. Leaves a lingering, if faint, impression.</comment>
