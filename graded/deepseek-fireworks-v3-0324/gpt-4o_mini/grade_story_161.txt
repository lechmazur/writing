<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's vigilance and orchardist background are intriguing but slightly underdeveloped. Her motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the peacock seal and conspiracies feels slightly rushed. The arc is satisfying but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sterile facility contrasts well with Clara's past, but the setting's potential isn't fully realized. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (hidden family secrets). The peacock metaphor is fresh, but some phrasing feels slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the facility feels underutilized. The storyâ€™s brevity works, though some themes could be deeper.</comment>
