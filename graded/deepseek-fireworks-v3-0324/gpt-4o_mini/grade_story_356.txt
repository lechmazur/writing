<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her actions, but her "wry caretaker" attribute could be more pronounced in her interactions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the tremor's abrupt introduction slightly disrupts the flow. The resolution, however, ties back neatly to the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, and the atmosphere perfectly complements Elara's introspection and the story's cosmic scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (chalk, phone, clouds) and a layered theme elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the tremor's execution could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. The handling of time and emotion avoids clich√©s, but the "wry" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. Leaves a lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
