<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "underground poet" identity feels underdeveloped. Her yearning for adventure is compelling but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the transition from contemplation to action feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the "witch's familiar menagerie" feels underutilized despite its potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (map tear, blanket) and subtext, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (map as gateway, restless artist). Language avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story feels constrained by its length. Leaves a lingering thought but lacks deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
