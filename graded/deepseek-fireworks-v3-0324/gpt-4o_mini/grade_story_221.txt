<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's dual identity as a wreck-diver and ghost whisperer is intriguing but underutilized. Her motivation to confront grief is clear, though her profession feels more decorative than integral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the amber serving as a catalyst for Clara's emotional arc. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is vividly rendered, with sensory details amplifying the melancholic tone. The setting and object (amber) are symbiotically linked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber as trapped grief) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant without being trite, and the theme of thawing grief resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its melancholic joy, though the "ghost whisperer" angle risks clich√©. Emotional nuance is strong, but some phrases verge on overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
