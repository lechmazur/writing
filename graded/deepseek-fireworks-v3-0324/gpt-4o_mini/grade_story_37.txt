<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's transformation from con artist to guardian is compelling, but her motivation to "become the guardian of tomorrow’s flame" feels slightly abstract. Her actions with the sheet music and yodeling are vivid and revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the detour to avoid construction feels tangential. The yodeling climax ties the story together effectively, though the rainforest setting isn't fully utilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is evocative but underdeveloped. The waiting room's atmosphere contrasts well with Lila's whimsical yodeling, though sensory details could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sheet music, yodeling) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of redemption could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "remnants of her past clung like mist"). Avoids clichés, but the "guardian of tomorrow’s flame" phrase borders on pretentious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the rainforest setting feels underused. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
