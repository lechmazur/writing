<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear but her "intelligently foolish" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her shapeshifting ability is intriguing but her boredom lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot moves forward logically, but the taxi ride feels abrupt. The ending hints at a larger arc, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and rain-soaked atmosphere are vivid and immersive, though the caves' connection to the figurine could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has thematic potential, but the "measured wildness" tone wavers. Symbolism (figurine, rain) is effective but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (rebellion against empire). The shapeshifter's voice is distinct, though some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the taxi ride and caves feel disjointed. The ending suggests depth but doesnâ€™t fully deliver.</comment>
