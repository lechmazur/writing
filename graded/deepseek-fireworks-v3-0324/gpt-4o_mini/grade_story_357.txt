<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and character arc are well-defined, with the black rose serving as a potent symbol of her solitude and growth. Her reactions to the party and despair feel authentic and nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the transition from solitude to party feels slightly abrupt. The board game rounds effectively drive the narrative forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair and icy atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like "crackled with icy magic" immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (black rose, frost giant) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original handling of solitude and despair, but the "alpha predator" metaphor feels slightly forced. The prose avoids clich√©s but could be sharper in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story with thematic depth. The brevity works in its favor, though some elements (e.g., the party) could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
