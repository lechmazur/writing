<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone pilot's "cynically hopeful" attribute is well-integrated, but his motivation to "lure possibility from despair" feels slightly forced in the speed-dating context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but leans heavily on the speed-dating event, which feels incongruous with the medieval fantasy setting. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory and "charred serenity" tone create a haunting atmosphere, though the orchard's impending destruction lacks deeper sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (herb bundle as resilience) works, but the emotional impact is diluted by abrupt shifts between observatory and village. Dialogue is functional but not standout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "stranger in a strange land" tropes. Some phrases ("horizons of mercy") feel contrived rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels like itâ€™s checking boxes (e.g., speed dating) rather than fully exploiting its potential.</comment>
