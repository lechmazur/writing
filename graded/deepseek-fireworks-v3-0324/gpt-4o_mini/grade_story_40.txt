<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's reincarnation and guilt are compelling, but her "tentatively fierce" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her motivation to disrupt tradition is clear, though her voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the weather's role as a catalyst feels contrived. The arc from guilt to purpose is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing mood. The setting complements Clara's quest, though the toy soldier's connection to the space is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (soldier, recipe) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in Clara's premise, but phrases like "guilt’s haunting echo" verge on cliché. The tone wobbles between playful and earnest.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the weather and library feel slightly forced. The story lingers, suggesting depth beyond its length.</comment>
