<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her indifference feels slightly underdeveloped. Her reaction to Marcus is strong, but her "lovelorn" aspect could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the recipe detour slightly disrupts momentum. Pacing is tight but effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Futuristic slums and neon atmosphere are vivid, but the "rambling destiny" tone isn't fully realized. Sensory details excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolism (sticky label, avalanche), but dialogue with Marcus leans toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in worldbuilding, but some tropes (betrayed spy, ghostly ex) feel familiar. Nuance in Elara’s emotions saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the recipe tangent slightly dilutes focus. Ending lingers effectively.</comment>
