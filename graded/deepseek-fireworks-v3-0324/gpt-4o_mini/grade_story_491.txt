<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Serene's motivation is clear but her personality lacks deeper exploration; her actions align with her quest for wisdom, though her "voice" remains somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, but the connection between the greenhouse and the quilt feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, though the greenhouse's thematic potential isn't fully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance is muted by occasional telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (e.g., hidden wisdom in artifacts); prose avoids clichés but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity limits thematic depth; the ending lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
