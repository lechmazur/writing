<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's hesitance and motivation are clear, but her "bard" identity feels underutilized. The dinosaur plush effectively symbolizes her past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; dream-hopping sequences could be more distinct. The arc from sorrow to resilience is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and dreamscapes are vividly atmospheric, though the "crossing of the year" timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolism, but the "ironic awe" tone isn't fully realized. Ending is poignant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise, though some phrases verge on clich√© ("tapestry woven from sorrow"). Nuanced handling of time's fragility elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the bard role and "shyly loud" attribute feel tacked on. Length suits the introspective focus.</comment>
