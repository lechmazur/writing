<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "overzealous" trait could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The connection between the notebook and the pendant could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the mystical tone, though the "chaotic organization" could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but lacks a lingering punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The grandmother's secrets and the goddess motif feel fresh, though some phrasing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but the story could benefit from a stronger thematic resonance.</comment>
