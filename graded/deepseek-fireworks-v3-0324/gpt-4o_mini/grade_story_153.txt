<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her eternal student status feels slightly underdeveloped. Her use of the headlamp and journals reveals depth, though her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between digitizing thoughts and the miner's journal feels abrupt. The ending resolves neatly, though the middle could tighten.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the bioluminescent fungi/headlamp contrast enhances atmosphere. The timeframe (post-star) is haunting but slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (headlamp as burden/light) and subtext (immortality as acceptance). The ending resonates, though the theme could be more sharply articulated earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "mundanely glorious" feels forced. The detached tone works, though some phrases verge on overly ornate ("forgotten dreams").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about immortality's true cost.</comment>
