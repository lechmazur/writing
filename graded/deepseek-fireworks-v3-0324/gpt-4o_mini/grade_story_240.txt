<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's pragmatic soothsayer role is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her transformation into a "force of nature" is compelling, though her "lavishly humble" robes could be more integrated into her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the song and hammer forging miracles driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the storm's resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The setting deeply influences the story's mood and Elara's actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hammer, song) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "manufactured miracles" could be more subtly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The soothsayer-blacksmith hybrid is inventive, though the "dreadful hope" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story rather than dictating it. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression.</comment>
