<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her emotional depth is well-explored, but her "blameless" nature feels slightly underdeveloped given the smuggling context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the "final countdown" urgency isn't fully leveraged, making the stakes feel muted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details like jasmine and damp earth elevating the setting. The whispering gallery is underutilized, however.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the key) and subtext, but the theme of survival occasionally overshadows subtler emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (tunnels as metaphors, the lone survivor). Some phrasing borders on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the "grandiose modesty" tone feels inconsistently applied. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>
