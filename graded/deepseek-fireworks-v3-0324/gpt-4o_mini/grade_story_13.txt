<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear but his solemnity feels underdeveloped; his connection to the garden wisdom is compelling but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with poems guiding the arc effectively, though the climax (finding the garden) could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (parchment, shifting sands) enhancing the setting's mystique. The lab and tower are vividly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scrolls as breadcrumbs) and thematic depth (resilience vs. decay), but the ending's emotional payoff is slightly muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (hidden gardens, lone swordsmen). Some phrases verge on flowery without fresh subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the swordsman's role feels slightly forced. The brevity serves the story's meditative tone.</comment>
