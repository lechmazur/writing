<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Li Wei's calm demeanor and botanist heart create a compelling contrast, but his motivation to "spin a prophecy" feels slightly abstract. His humor and introspection add depth, though the longing theme could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the botanical press serving as a clever metaphor. The ending hints at a larger arc, but the tight word limit leaves some connections underdeveloped, particularly the prophecy's stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The palace's jasmine-scented air and butterfly carvings create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like the "rustle from the shadows" enhance the mood, though the timeframe's impact is minimal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flowers as lives, butterflies as secrets) elevates the narrative. The dialogue is sharp, but the humor occasionally undercuts the unease. The theme of preserving beauty resonates, though the prophecy's weight isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Li Wei's duality and the botanical press twist are inventive. Some phrases verge on overly poetic ("whispers of longing"), but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylish, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels intentional, though the prophecy's execution lacks punch. Leaves a lingering question about fate's fragility.</comment>
