<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his connection to the hair clip is evocative but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the transition from observation to action feels abrupt. Pacing is uneven due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The restaurant setting is vivid, but the lab reference feels tacked on. Atmosphere effectively supports the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (hair clip, sunrise) is strong, but the emotional payoff lacks depth. Ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept, though some phrasing leans generic. The hair clip's symbolism feels fresh, but the sentinel's role borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under word limits. The story lingers but lacks full thematic resonance.</comment>
