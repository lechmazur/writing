<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear but his transition from boredom to mischief feels slightly abrupt. His "valiantly bored" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the prank's execution lacks weight. The connection between craft fairs and Eli's rebellion could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard setting is vividly rendered, but the "ravine battered by storms" feels underutilized. Atmosphere supports mood well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext, but the ending's satisfaction is muted. The conflict with the watch is introduced effectively but resolved too neatly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors, though the "coy malevolence" tone wobbles. Avoids clich√©s but some emotional beats feel stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce decently, but the story feels slightly constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering question but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
