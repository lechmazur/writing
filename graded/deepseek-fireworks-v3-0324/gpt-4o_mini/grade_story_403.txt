<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "hope-worn" nature is well-established, but the shift to joy could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the fortune teller's booth feels underdeveloped as a plot device. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating library is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the theme. Sensory details (e.g., the seashell's spirals) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are effective, but the emotional resolution leans slightly toward telling. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "joyful agony" borders on contrived. The seashell metaphor is fresh, and the prose avoids excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story leaves a resonant impression, though the thematic depth could be sharper.</comment>
