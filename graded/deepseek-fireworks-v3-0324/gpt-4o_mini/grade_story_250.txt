<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "blunt heretic" trait feels underdeveloped. The teddy bear effectively grounds her nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ticker's role as a map is clever, though the "battle" metaphor slightly strains logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, but the temple's connection to the ticker feels tenuous. Atmosphere excels in supporting mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teddy bear, ticker) and emotional resonance. Ending is satisfying, though the "omniscient mind" conflict lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (lost knowledge, childhood talisman). Prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally over-explains emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "heretic" and "ticker" feel slightly forced. Length is deliberate, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
