<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "unlucky" trait is underdeveloped. Her earnest naivety shines, but deeper flaws or quirks would enrich her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric momentum rather than structured cause-and-effect. The wind chimes' guidance feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere with vivid sensory details. The workshop and playground swing create a haunting, evocative backdrop that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the endingâ€™s thematic resolution borders on didactic. The prose is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (quest for forgotten wisdom). Some metaphors are fresh ("spaces between rust and gold"), others generic ("whispers of the past").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the brevity limits deeper exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of melancholy and curiosity.</comment>
