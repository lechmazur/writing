<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's compassion and motivation are clear, but her "mage" aspect feels underdeveloped compared to her emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the submarine hull's role feels abrupt; tighter cause-and-effect would strengthen the arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the submarine feels like a forced inclusion; length suits the introspective focus.</comment>
