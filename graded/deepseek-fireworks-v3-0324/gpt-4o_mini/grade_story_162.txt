<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Max's carefree gambler persona is well-integrated, but his shift to introspection feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his 'uniquely trustworthy' attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the blueprint and island memories could be tighter. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop and island settings are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the story's mood, though the 'hush of old videotapes' feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism well (blueprint as a bridge). The ending is satisfying, but some themes could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but occasional phrases verge on clich√© ("laughter echoed like the waves"). Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative. The brief length works, though some ideas could be further developed.</comment>
