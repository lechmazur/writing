<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's "cynically gentle" nature is well-integrated, but her transition to rebellion feels slightly abrupt. Her motivation is clear, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the time machine's introduction feels sudden. Cause-and-effect logic holds, but the climax is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eldergrove's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (flowers, shadows) enhancing the mystical tone. The setting supports the theme beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flowers, shadows) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of rebellion could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original but leans on tropes (oppressive mayor, time travel). Some phrases feel overly poetic ("shadows learned to speak"). Nuance in emotion is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the time machine feels tacked on. The length suits the story, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
