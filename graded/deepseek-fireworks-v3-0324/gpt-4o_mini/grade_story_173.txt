<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "wandering orchardist" background feels underutilized in the underwater setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the multiverse concept feels slightly tacked on rather than fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly rendered, but the "multiverse" timeframe clashes tonally with the melancholic, grounded atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (leaves, phantom hand) and emotional resonance, though the theme of "kitchen table wisdom" is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (forgotten ruins, ghostly guidance). Some phrases verge on overly poetic without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the multiverse and orchardist roles feel like forced inclusions. The bittersweet tone is effective.</comment>
