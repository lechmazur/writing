<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her guilt and desire for reconciliation driving her actions. Her "guiltily innocent" attribute is well-integrated, though her wilderness guide background feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the sunken ship setting feels tangential to the core conflict. The pacing is effective, though the climax (sending the message) could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative but unevenâ€”the sunken ballroom is vivid but doesn't fully enhance the emotional core. Sensory details (salt, old wood) are strong, but the setting-concept connection is weak.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (blanket, ring) and subtext, though the "manic clarity" tone isn't fully realized. The ending is satisfying but could delve deeper into emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in its metaphor (blanket as diary), but the wilderness guide role feels generic. Some phrases verge on flowery ("manic clarity"), though the emotional nuance is handled well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite forced elements (ship, guide). The crochet metaphor is inventive, but the story slightly strains to accommodate assigned elements. Leaves a lingering emotional impression.</comment>
