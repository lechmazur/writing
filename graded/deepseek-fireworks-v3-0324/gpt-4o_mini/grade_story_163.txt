<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her "bitterly optimistic" attribute, but her backstory as a "lost heiress" feels underdeveloped and somewhat clich√©d.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the detour and scenic overlook feel contrived as a method to "unify" her fragmented reality. Pacing is decent but rushed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station is barely utilized, weakening the setting's potential. Sensory details are evocative but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (parking stub, clouds) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted by predictable beats. The ending is satisfying but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (heiress, scenic epiphany). Some phrases feel flowery without purpose. Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The story feels constrained by its length, lacking fuller exploration.</comment>
