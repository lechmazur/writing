<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with the fishing lure serving as a powerful symbol of his unresolved grief. His actions align well with his internal conflict, though his "privately public" attribute could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-loop structure is coherent and drives the plot effectively, but the quantum tunnel setting feels underutilized. The resolution is satisfying, though the pacing slightly rushes Eli's emotional breakthrough.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, particularly the rain and bell motifs, but the quantum tunnel lacks vivid sensory detail. The setting supports the theme but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lure, raindrops) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of acceptance is layered. Some metaphors verge on overused ("ghost haunting his existence").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original handling of trauma and time loops, though the "excited boredom" tone isn't fully realized. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact. Minor stylistic inconsistencies.</comment>
