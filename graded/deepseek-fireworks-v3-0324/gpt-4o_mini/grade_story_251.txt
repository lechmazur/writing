<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalence and prophetic nature are well-integrated, but her motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" feels slightly abstract. Her connection to the marbles is vivid, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The "final oath" resolution is satisfying, but the pacing slows in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony is atmospheric but underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., marbles' cracks) are evocative and enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (marbles as fate), but the theme of acceptance feels slightly rushed. Literary devices are effective but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "cracked marbles as forgotten dreams"). Avoids clich√©s, though "bashful arrogance" is a tad contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thought-provoking, but the lunar setting feels incidental. The brevity works, though some elements could be tighter.</comment>
