<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's duality as a poisoner and her thrill in defying gravity are compelling, but her "innocently guilty" attribute feels underdeveloped and slightly inconsistent with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt structure is engaging, but the skateboarding moment feels abrupt and disrupts the otherwise smooth pacing. The resolution ties back neatly to the rapier's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum's atmosphere is richly detailed, with sensory descriptions enhancing the mood. The "dusty starlight" tone works well, though the skateboarding slightly clashes with the setting's solemnity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rapier as duality) and evocative prose, but the emotional resonance is slightly muted by the rushed ending. The theme of balance is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of poisoner and scavenger hunt tropes, but some phrases ("edges of gravity") feel overly poetic without grounding. The skateboarding is a fresh but awkward addition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively weaves most elements, though the skateboarding and "code of instinct" feel tacked on. Leaves a lingering thought about duality, but the execution isn't flawless.</comment>
