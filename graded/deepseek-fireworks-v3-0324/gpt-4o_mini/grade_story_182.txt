<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "unknowing heir" aspect feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her longing for belonging.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the spoon and her heritage could be stronger. The ending resolves her emotional arc effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The magnetic mountain and abandoned movie house create a haunting, electric mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spoon, murals) and emotional resonance. The theme of belonging is clear, though the "frolicsome regret" tone feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases verge on flowery. The "trivially monumental" attribute feels contrived. Nuanced emotion, but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but the magnetic mountain feels underutilized.</comment>
