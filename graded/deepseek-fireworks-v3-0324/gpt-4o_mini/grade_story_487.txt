<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's docile yet bruiser nature is intriguing, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract. His calmness contrasts well with the chaos, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the baton's allure, but the shredded map feels underutilized. Pacing is strong, though the climax could benefit from more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the man-eating plants enhance the atmosphere. The drum solos add a unique rhythmic layer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (baton as key, plants as kin) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "language barriers" is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but "brash tenderness" tone wobbles. Some phrases verge on purple prose, though the core idea avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the map and language barriers feel tacked on. The length suits the mythic scope, leaving a haunting impression.</comment>
