<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's phobias and stunt double background are well-integrated, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. Her motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The map and net serve as effective plot devices, though the garage sales timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library and pyramid setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are strong, though the "echoes in the dark" could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the net) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors lean toward the generic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise is original, but some phrasing feels slightly formulaic. The mundanely spiritual attribute is intriguing but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though a few elements (garage sales, timeframe) feel less integrated. The brevity works in its favor.</comment>
