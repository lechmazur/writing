<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlin's underachieving nature and motivation to reclaim his heritage are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "voice" is distinct but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the space station setting feels underutilized in driving the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative but the abandoned space station and farmland clash tonally. Sensory details are strong but inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (doll as key) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on tropes (magical awakening). Some phrases feel formulaic. Nuance in emotion is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite forced elements. Creative combination of magic/tech, but the length exposes pacing gaps.</comment>
