<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's apprehension and motivation are clear, but her archer skills feel underutilized. The candle symbolism is strong, but her transition from shadow to courage could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the data center mission lacks setup. The festival feels disconnected from the cyberpunk core. Pacing suffers from word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cyberpunk atmosphere is vivid with neon and decay, but the balloon festival clashes tonally. Sensory details (candle scent, hum of laughter) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle, dawn) works well, but the theme of compassion cycles is heavy-handed. Dialogue is purposeful, though Kael's intro feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "truth vs. lies" conflict. Some phrases ("dying stars," "steel-gray skyline") verge on clich√©. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements feel forced together (archer + cyberpunk). The candle and dawn imagery lingers, but the story lacks depth beyond its premise.</comment>
