<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "cryptic medium" trait feels underdeveloped. Her connection to the telescope is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the accidental double-booking feels contrived. The telescope's role is compelling, though the pacing is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant setting is vivid but underutilized. The "comforting unease" tone is well-executed, enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of legacy could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original but leans on familiar tropes (art as a conduit). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive but some elements feel forced. The length suits the story, though the cybernetic setting doesn't fully integrate.</comment>
