<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's death wish and poison-tasting profession are compelling but could be more deeply explored. Her motivation to map energy flows is clear but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels compressed. The connection between the bookmark, hidden societies, and energy flows is intriguing but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and ice sculpture create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. Creative combination, but the short length slightly limits depth.</comment>
