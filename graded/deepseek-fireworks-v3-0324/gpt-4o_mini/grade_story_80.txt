<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her quest, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The doorknob's role drives the story logically, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the eerie tone and supports Elara's quest effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor ("giant's ribcage") enrich the narrative. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "the last fragment" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases ("quiet mania") feel slightly forced. Emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative well. The length feels deliberate, though the ending could linger more.</comment>
