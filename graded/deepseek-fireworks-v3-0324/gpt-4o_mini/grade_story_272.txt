<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leonard's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His interaction with the whistle reveals depth, though his cynicism could be more consistently woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the "reversed trails" method feels underdeveloped. Pacing is strong, though the resolution slightly rushes Leonard's transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-shift atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (sound of the whistle, hum of the coffee machine) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance and uses symbolism (whistle as hope) well. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors ("tree of regret") verge on clich√©. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors (whistle as a "key"). However, "hopeful yet cynical" feels slightly formulaic, and the "encrypted message archive" metaphor is forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering thought about reclaiming creativity, though some concepts (reversed trails) weaken cohesion.</comment>
