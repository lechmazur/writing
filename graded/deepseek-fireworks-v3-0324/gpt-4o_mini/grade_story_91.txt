<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's backstory as an escaped experiment is compelling, but his motivation to reawaken beauty could be more deeply explored. His gentleness is consistent but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from fear to curiosity in the townsfolk feels slightly abrupt. The cloud-shadow method is unique but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The weather station and ghost stories create a haunting atmosphere, though the setting's experimental nature isn't fully leveraged. Sensory details are evocative but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance is strong, and the theme of beauty vs. mechanization is clear. However, the ending, while satisfying, lacks deeper subtext or lingering questions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and the elements serve the narrative well. The brevity works, but the cloud-shadow method could be more integral to the plot.</comment>
