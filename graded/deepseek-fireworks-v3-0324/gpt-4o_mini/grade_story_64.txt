<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the connection between the scale and the coded scuffs feels slightly forced, disrupting momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the "hush before the verdict" timeframe doesn't fully mesh with the setting's energy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the tight word limit strains the integration of all elements, particularly the coded scuffs and timeframe.</comment>
