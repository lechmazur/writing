<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "fading" aspect feels underexplored. The lavender bundle effectively reveals her longing for connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the discovery of the tome. The arc from apathy to determination is satisfying but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details like the lavender scent and candlelight enhancing the melancholic yet mystical mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lavender, tome) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors ("newborn galaxy"), but "enthusiastic apathy" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, though the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic depth. Leaves a lingering sense of curiosity.</comment>
