<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Edrin's indifference is subtly woven into his actions and reflections, but his motivation to seal a covenant feels slightly abstract. The ribbon and haw figurine reveal depth, but his 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the covenant's stakes are vague. The altar scene ties the arc together, though the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacombs' atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, enhancing the mystic tone. The setting and objects (ribbon, haw) are meaningfully connected, though the bells' timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (haw, ribbon) and subtext (transformation). The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Theme of rebirth is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original handling of tropes (blacksmith, covenant), but the "rising from rubble" concept feels slightly forced. Prose avoids clich√©s, though some metaphors (e.g., "weight of indifference") are predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, but the covenant's ambiguity slightly weakens impact. Creative combination of objects and setting.</comment>
