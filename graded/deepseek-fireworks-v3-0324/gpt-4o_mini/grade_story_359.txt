<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's absent-mindedness and brewing passion are clear, but his motivation could be deeper. Clara's introduction feels organic, but her backstory is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the "chance encounter" feels contrived. The lion knocker's symbolism ties the arc together neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nature sound archive is vividly rendered, but the AI backdrop feels underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., brass knocker, golden light) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lion, brewing) and emotional resonance, but the theme of AI's impact lacks exploration. Dialogue is natural but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases ("battered like ships") verge on clich√©. Nuanced emotions, though the AI angle could be fresher.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, but the AI element feels tacked on. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection on human connection.</comment>
