<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen's paradox of being "strongly weak" is intriguing but could be more deeply explored. Her motivation is clear, but her actions sometimes feel slightly disjointed from her established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between tracking legends and finding courage is logical, though the levitation concept feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The "reimagined" Celtic village works well, though the timeframe ("between games") is unclear.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the ink pot). The ending is satisfying, but some themes could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel slightly overworked. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering impression, though some concepts could be tighter.</comment>
