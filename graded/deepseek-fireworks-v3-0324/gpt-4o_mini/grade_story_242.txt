<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her role as a bridge between cultures, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed; the revolution concept isn't fully explored within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vault and herbs create a rich atmosphere, though the café scene could use more sensory detail to deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clichés, though "mirthful solemnity" feels contrived. Nuanced emotion in Elara's hesitation stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story’s brevity limits thematic depth. Leaves a faint lingering question about the revolution’s scale.</comment>
