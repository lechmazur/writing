<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her role as a midwife and her desire to reclaim memories. Her "openly secretive" nature adds depth, though more dialogue or internal conflict could enhance her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The diary discovery drives the plot well, though the maelstrom's calming could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (herbs, moonlight). The maelstrom and orchard create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors Elara's turmoil, though the island's "drifting" could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (herbs as memory vessels) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused (e.g., "grains of sand").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its premise, but some phrasing feels slightly formulaic ("whispering secrets of the past"). The theme of memory is handled with nuance, though the "dissonant calm" tone isn't fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering reflection on memory, though the maelstrom's resolution could be more impactful.</comment>
