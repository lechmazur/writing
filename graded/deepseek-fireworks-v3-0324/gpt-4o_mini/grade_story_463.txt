<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's dry wit and sentinel role are subtly woven into his introspection and actions, though his motivation to "learn traditional methods" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the transition from confiscation to weaving feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (salt, decay, moonlight) expertly enhancing the mood. Setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (rope, dance) and subtext elevate the story. Ending is purposeful, though the waltz motif could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the lighthouse metaphor, but some phrases ("eroding promises," "reckless precision") edge toward clich√©. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the dance feels tangential. Style is polished, and the length feels deliberate, leaving a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
