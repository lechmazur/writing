<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear but her "carefully careless" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her connection to the orchid is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has coherence but the blood drive encounter feels abrupt. The botanical collection ties the arc together well, though pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—haunting, sensory-rich, and immersive. The mansion and timeframe blend seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (orchid, silence) and subtext, but the ending's liberation feels slightly unearned. Literary craft elevates the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in perspective but leans on gothic tropes. Some phrases ("loud silence") verge on cliché. Nuanced emotion saves it from being generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the blood drive and mansion clash tonally. The length feels deliberate, though some themes could be sharper.</comment>
