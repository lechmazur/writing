<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vesper's motivation is clear and nuanced, with the plush clownfish serving as a poignant symbol of her faded morality. Her "calculatedly playful" demeanor adds depth, though her zealot assassin background feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The mission to retell an epic from a villain’s perspective drives the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coral reef city is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The setting and timeframe (nature walks) harmonize well, though the "reversed echoes" method feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the plush) and subtext, with a memorable perspective. The ending is satisfying, though the "humorous solemnity" tone occasionally clashes with the darker themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clichés, but the "zealot assassin" premise feels slightly forced. The writing style is purposeful, though some metaphors verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering thought about morality, though the word limit slightly hampers depth.</comment>
