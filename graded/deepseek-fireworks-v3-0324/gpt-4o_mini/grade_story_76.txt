<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's "shyly unstoppable" nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to find beauty in decay is clear and consistent. His actions with the magnifier and censored books reveal depth, though his transition to community leader feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with Eli's discovery of the garden passage driving the transformation. The ending resolves neatly, though the film club addition feels tangential to the core arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The foggy bay and abandoned ship are richly atmospheric, with rust and peeling paint evoking decay. Sensory details (brass magnifier, faded ticket stubs) immerse the reader, though the film club slightly dilutes the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (magnifier as insight, rust as beauty) and subtext (dreams vs. decay). The ending is satisfying, but the film club detracts from the thematic focus on solitary rediscovery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Eli's quiet determination and the ship's transformation feel authentic. Only minor quibbles: "fierce repose" is slightly overwrought, and the film club is a predictable twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The length feels intentional, though the film club subplot slightly weakens focus. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
