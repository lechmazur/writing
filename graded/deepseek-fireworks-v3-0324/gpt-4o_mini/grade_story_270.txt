<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's "humbly arrogant" attribute and motivation to "harness the ephemeral" are well-integrated, but her cynicism could be more sharply contrasted with her vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the globe's awakening serving as a clear pivot. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the dread's escalation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library and "eerie nostalgia" tone are masterfully rendered, with sensory details (dust motes, humming globe) deepening immersion. Only the "borrowed century" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (globe as cosmos/loneliness) and subtext. The ending's thematic resonance—isolation vs. connection—elevates the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("weight of a borrowed century"), though "humbly arrogant" risks cliché. Minimal AI tells; emotional nuance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the tension between solitude and cosmic kinship, suggesting depth beyond the page.</comment>
