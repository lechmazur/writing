<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear but his princely background feels underutilized. His introspection with the mortar and pestle reveals depth, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the snowstorm and chance encounter driving the arc. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (dust, snow, stone), and the abandoned customs office enhances the theme of isolation. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (mortar/pestle, storm) and emotional resonance, though the dialogue leans slightly generic. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but the "exiled prince" trope and some flowery phrasing ("aching void") edge toward clich√©. Nuanced emotion saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, though the theme of loneliness is somewhat conventional.</comment>
