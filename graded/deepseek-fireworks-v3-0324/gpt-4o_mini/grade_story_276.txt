<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's unease and motivation are clear, but her "emissary" role feels underdeveloped. The postcards effectively reveal her inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The lurch and alarms feel abrupt, though they tie into the theme of redemption.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orbital station and postcards create a vivid contrast. Sensory details (rustling, sterile walls) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (postcards, debris) and subtext. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "thin coathanger") stand out. Some phrasing leans slightly generic ("beauty from decay").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the word limit strains the resolution. The theme of redemption is compelling but slightly overt.</comment>
