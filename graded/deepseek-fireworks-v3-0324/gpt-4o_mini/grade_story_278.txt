<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias' brooding nature and motivation to escape servitude are clear and consistent, but his "theoretically spontaneous" moment feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection; the decision to disappear lacks buildup, making the resolution feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crater base and murky tenderness create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "dance of dust" motif is overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glasses, dust) and emotional resonance, but the theme of liberation is somewhat heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (isolated artist, oppressive setting). Some phrases verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the story feels constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering but predictable impression.</comment>
