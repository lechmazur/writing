<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "systematically chaotic" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the cosmic event resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect is logical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "lizard people" debate risks tropiness. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the cosmic collision idea feels underexplored. Leaves a lingering question about connection.</comment>
