<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "nondescript seer" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her analytical innovation is well-integrated, though her distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The USB drive as a relic ties neatly to delayed justice, though the surprise party timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and rain-scented atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing mood and theme. Sensory details are strong, but the party's aftermath is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (rain, relic) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some subtext feels surface-level. Craft is polished but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (mythic relic, corruption). The rain motif is fresh, but the "innocent cynicism" tone isn't fully realized. Avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative element integration. The brevity works, though some themes could be deeper. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
