<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "welcoming landlord" role feels underdeveloped. His transformation is compelling but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the parade detour feels abrupt. The arc is satisfying, though the resolution leans on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The studio's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the parade's sensory details lack specificity. The bee pin's symbolism is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional climax is somewhat predictable. The ending resonates but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar beats (e.g., the transformative dance). Some phrasing feels formulaic ("manic clarity").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but the parade element feels contrived. Leaves a lingering, if slightly generic, impression.</comment>
