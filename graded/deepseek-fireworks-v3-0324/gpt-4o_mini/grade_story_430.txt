<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jax's closed-off nature and yearning for change are well-conveyed, but his motivation to "taste the stars" feels slightly abstract for his established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from despair to determination feels rushed due to the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe ("before the first lie") is underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "stars in a single kiss" motif edges toward clich√©. The grotesque creature is a standout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the word limit constraints are occasionally felt in pacing and depth.</comment>
