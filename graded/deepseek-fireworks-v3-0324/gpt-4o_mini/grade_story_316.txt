<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's timid yet determined nature is well-developed, and her motivation to fulfill a childhood promise is clear and consistent. Her actions align with her personality, though her "seraphic" quality feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the connection between the temple and arcade could be smoother. Pacing is effective, but the transition to collective action feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reimagined Greek temple and post-industrial setting create a vivid, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, sunlight) enhance immersion, though the arcade's role could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (typewriter ribbon, scoreboard) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors ("scattered harmony") feel overly poetic without deeper payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh imagery and subversion of tropes (healing through nostalgia). Some phrases verge on flowery, but the voice avoids AI-generic tendencies. Emotional nuance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the temple setting feels slightly detached. The brevity works, and the story lingers with thematic weight. A few tighter integrations would elevate cohesion.</comment>
