<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introversion and empathy are well-integrated, driving her actions and reflections. Her motivation to champion outcasts is clear and consistent, though her "drowsy enthusiasm" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the marionette metaphor feels slightly forced. Pacing is effective, though the transition from starfish to marionette could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The space pirate hideout and asteroid setting are evocative, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., the dried starfish) are used effectively, but the "drowsy enthusiasm" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (starfish, marionette) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on over-explanation. Theme of resilience is clear but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, but "mountain wisdom" feels tacked on. Some phrases are overly poetic ("weight of the universe"). Avoids clich√©s but occasionally strains for profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, though the marionette feels less organic. The brief length works, leaving a lingering thought about empathy and belonging.</comment>
