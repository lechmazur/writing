<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's rebellious nature and motivation are clear, but her "underestimated" aspect feels underdeveloped. The pocket knife adds a tangible edge to her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Lila's mission, though Marco's sudden involvement slightly disrupts pacing. The arc from stagnation to renewal is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (mildew, cobwebs) enhancing the atmosphere. The "ephemeral gloom" tone is well-executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (knife as tool for carving joy) and subtext (nostalgia vs. renewal). The ending is purposeful, though the dialogue feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of decay and culinary warmth, but some phrases ("sadly joyful") verge on clich√©. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the cuisine motif feels underexplored. The brevity works, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
