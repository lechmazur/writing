<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's morose demeanor and motivation to mend are clear, but her paladin role feels underutilized. The needle symbolism is strong, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The blackout and restoration drive the story logically, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory's lavishly austere setting and blackout atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the mood and character motivations. Sensory details are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes hope and collaboration, with strong symbolism (needle, light). Dialogue is natural, but the theme of restoration could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in combining paladin and sci-fi elements, but some tropes (scholar collaboration) feel familiar. Emotional nuance is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a satisfying glow of hope.</comment>
