<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jarek's edgy, pessimistic nature is clear, but his motivation to confront memories feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, but deeper introspection could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of resolution, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the transition from nostalgia to resolution. Pacing is well-managed overall.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom house and windmill create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (bioluminescence, damp earth) elevate the mood, though the windmill's connection to memory could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (candle, flyer) and evocative prose. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of memory distortion could be more sharply articulated. Emotional resonance is high.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and fresh metaphors avoid clich√©s, though "blurry vividness" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of regret, but some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering melancholy, though the windmill's role could be more integral to the theme.</comment>
