<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, her actions align with her "ordinarily extraordinary" trait, and her use of puppetry reveals depth. However, her "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the dentures, but the transition from bookstore to puppet show feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances the warmth theme. The dentures' connection to the setting is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong, and literary devices (e.g., the "fractured idyll" tone) are effective. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict (hearts grown cold) could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The story avoids clich√©s, though the "lull before an apologetic text" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the puppet show method could be more integral.</comment>
