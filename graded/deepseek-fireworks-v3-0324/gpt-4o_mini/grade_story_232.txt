<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her physician background feels underutilized; her obsession with inscriptions is compelling but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the cutlass discovery, though the transition from coffee grounds to blade carvings feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (salty breeze, brewing coffee), but the digital nomad camp feels incongruous with the historical mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coffee grounds, cutlass) and subtext, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the "dire enchantment" premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (obsessed scholar, relic as key); prose avoids clich√©s but some metaphors (coffee grounds as patterns) feel overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the camp setting and physician role distract from the core theme. The brevity works, but the story feels like a vignette rather than a complete arc.</comment>
