<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's insomnia and artistic struggle are vividly portrayed, but her motivation to "outlast the final obstacle" feels slightly abstract. The wizard’s hat as a muse is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows well, but the transition from midnight painting to dawn resolution is abrupt. The "final obstacle" lacks concrete definition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop and bioluminescent fungi create a lush, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (damp earth, paint) enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hat, smiles) and emotional depth, but the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. Theme of resilience is clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "frolicsome regret" borders on contrived. The wizard’s hat’s bullet hole is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the word limit strains the climax. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
