<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's daydreaming nature and scholarly curiosity are well-integrated, but her motivation to create a masterpiece feels slightly abrupt. Her actions align with her traits, but deeper introspection could strengthen her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, with the satellite discovery driving the vision. The pacing is tight but effective, though the skating rink connection feels underdeveloped. The arc is clear but could benefit from sharper transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The submerged palace is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The cursed lake and melting glacier backdrop enrich the setting, though the "pristine chaos" tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (meteor, mural) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused. Theme of compassion is clear but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but some phrases feel formulaic ("threads of compassion"). Emotional nuance is present but could delve deeper. Avoids clich√©s but risks over-ornamentation in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the skating rink feels tangential. Creative combination of themes, but brevity limits full exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, suggesting deliberate craft.</comment>
