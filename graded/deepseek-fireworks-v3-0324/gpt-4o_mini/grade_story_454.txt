<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jax's reckless nature and motivation for acceptance are clear, but his emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped. The clover symbolizes luck well, but his "rationally emotional" side isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the heist, with a clear arc. Pacing is tight but effective, though the synchronized watch alarms feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The funhouse mirrors enhance the theme of fractured identity, though the "map tear" setting is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clover, mirrors) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "distant companionship" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original setting and tone, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("laughter echoed like distant memories"). Emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the story feels deliberate. The length suits the narrative, though some concepts (e.g., "map tear") feel tacked on.</comment>
