<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Felix's motivation is clear but his "uniquely generic" trait feels underdeveloped. His brewing ambition aligns with his actions, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the staircase discovery feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the protest backdrop is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (damp earth, murmurs), but the graveyard setting clashes slightly with the brewing theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, darkness) and subtext, but the ending's resolve feels rushed. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (haunted mansion, mirror symbolism). Some metaphors feel fresh, but emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the protest timeframe feels tacked on. Style is clear, though the brevity limits thematic depth.</comment>
