<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Clara's actions, though the thief encounter feels slightly abrupt. The resolution ties back to her motivation effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering reflection on legacy and resilience.</comment>
