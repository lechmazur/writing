<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Felix's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "trickster" nature feels underdeveloped. The gift tag reveals depth, but his "impatiently patient" trait could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. The dares drive the action, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is uneven for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood, but the "futuristic farm" aspect feels underutilized. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (gift tag, biodome) is effective, but the theme of "chosen paths" is overstated. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (trickster lawyer, cryptic dares). Some phrases feel formulaic ("ghostly resolve"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. The length feels restrictive, though the story manages a lingering thought about self-discovery.</comment>
