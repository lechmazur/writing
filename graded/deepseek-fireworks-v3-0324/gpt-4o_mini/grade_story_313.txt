<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "unusually normal" attribute feels underdeveloped. His shift from deceit to redemption is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the ghostly interrogation feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tape dispenser) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though the ghost dialogue leans toward exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but slightly formulaic in its redemption arc. Avoids clich√©s, but the ghostly apparitions feel trope-adjacent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
