<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Khet's hesitantly bold nature is clear, but his transition from archer to adventurer feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between the recipe and his decision to leave is logical, though the TV subtitles feel somewhat forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Egyptian palace is vividly rendered with rich sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The setting supports Khet's internal conflict beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (recipe as narrative potential). The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (breaking free from destiny). The prose avoids purple tendencies but could be sharper in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the narrative well. The length suits the arc, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
