<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. Her "voice" is distinct, though deeper introspection could enhance her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the midnight calls' urgency could be better integrated earlier to tighten cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cloud city and obsessive calm tone are vividly rendered, but the library's abandonment could be more tactile to deepen atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, but the cloud city's relevance to the theme could be sharper. Leaves a lingering question of agency.</comment>
