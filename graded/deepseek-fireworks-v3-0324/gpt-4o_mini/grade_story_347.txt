<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "singularly multiple" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped. Her reactions to the shoelace and violin string reveal depth, though her "undercover" aspect is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the perpetual motion workshop and the plant experiment feels tenuous. The ending resolves neatly, though the middle could tighten.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "perpetual motion" concept isn't fully exploited. Sensory details (e.g., the violin string) are evocative and enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (violin string as fragility) and subtext (faith in self vs. plants). The ending is satisfying, though the "graceless beauty" tone occasionally clashes with the workshop's chaos.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though "plant whisperer" edges toward clich√©. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, but the "undercover" element feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but some elements (perpetual motion, undercover role) feel underbaked. The brevity works, leaving a lingering question about faith and connection.</comment>
