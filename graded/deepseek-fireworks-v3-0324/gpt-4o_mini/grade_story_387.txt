<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's selflessness and musical passion are vividly portrayed, but her motivation to map star migrations via music feels slightly abstract without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the vinyl record's sudden transformative effect on the ship lacks setup, slightly disrupting pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and cosmic atmosphere are richly evoked, with sensory details (sound, light) enhancing the mood. The setting deeply supports the theme of longing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (vinyl as a map) and emotional resonance, though the climax's "shimmering walls" veers toward melodrama. Theme of memory and trust is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but "savage grace" tone feels inconsistently applied. Metaphors (e.g., "whispers of forgotten dreams") are fresh but occasionally overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the word limit strains the vinyl's significance. Leaves a lingering sense of wonder, but some thematic threads feel underexplored.</comment>
