<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His yearning for connection and fear of vulnerability are well-explored, though his shift to embracing strategy feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the tight word limit forces some compression. The connection between kneading snow and mastering strategy is inventive but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and evocative, with stellar sensory details. The quasar observation deck and distant galaxies enhance the mood, though the snow map feels slightly disjointed from the cosmic backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bees, tracks) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused. The theme of connection is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "mixed blessings" concept leans toward stated rather than shown. The prose is purposeful but occasionally ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope. Minor pacing issues.</comment>
