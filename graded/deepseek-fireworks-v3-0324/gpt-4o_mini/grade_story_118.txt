<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character development is strong, with Dr. Elara's hive-mind therapist role and peculiar approach adding depth. Agents' motivations and regrets are clear, though some backstories feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but leans heavily on the therapy session framework. The candle wax method is inventive, but the resolution feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (candle wax, scent, flickering light) enhancing the mood. The setting and timeframe mesh well, though the facility's specifics are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (wax as regret) and emotional resonance. Dialogue is purposeful, but the hive-mind mechanic could be explored more deeply for greater impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the hive-mind therapist and wax-coding concept. Some phrases verge on flowery, but the narrative avoids clich√©s and maintains a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the tight word limit slightly hampers thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering thought about regret and healing.</comment>
