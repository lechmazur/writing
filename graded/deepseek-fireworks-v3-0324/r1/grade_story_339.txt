<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's joyless demeanor and guilt are vividly portrayed, but her transition from mime to dancer feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the seesaw's echo and drawer knob serving as potent catalysts. Pacing is excellent, though the crane dance could use more grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prismatic lake and construction cranes create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (light, sound) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (knob as conduit, shadows as ghosts) and a resonant ending elevate this. The theme of unspoken guilt is piercingly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, though "modest extravagance" feels slightly contrived. Metaphors are fresh, avoiding clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache.</comment>
