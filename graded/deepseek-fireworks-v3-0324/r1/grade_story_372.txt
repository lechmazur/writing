<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Veyra's lovelorn nature and spy background are well-integrated, but her motivation to betray Jax feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the drone threat resolution lacks depth. Pacing suffers slightly from word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Neo-Kyushu's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with synth-oil puddles and rusted reflections enhancing the cyberpunk tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "tasted like time" metaphor and Veyra's coldness stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the avalanche of drones feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
