<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her identity as a time refugee. Her actions reveal a quiet defiance and a willingness to sacrifice, making her compelling and distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The catapult's use and the star alignment feel organic, though the resolution is slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming, rusted gears) enrich the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tablecloth as memory, lighthouse as needle). The ending lingers with emotional weight and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is vivid but purposeful, and the handling of emotion is nuanced (e.g., Veyra's tattoo as silent defiance).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
