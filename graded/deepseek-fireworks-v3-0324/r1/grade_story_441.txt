<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher's barefoot wandering and stamp-collecting reveal a contemplative, yearning nature, but her motivation to compose a lullaby feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from collision to shared melody, with a satisfying arc, though the flash mob’s abruptness slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accelerator’s sterile contrast with the stamps’ intimacy creates a haunting atmosphere, though the timeframe ("between bus routes") feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, resonant symbolism (stamps as absences), and a lingering ending elevate this beyond mere vignette. The cassette’s fusion of science and song is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "soundwaves to find what’s missing") and nuanced emotion avoid cliché. Only the flash mob’s randomness feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements, with the stamps and accelerator enriching each other. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for contemplation.</comment>
