<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garrick's jovial yet reluctant nature is well-developed, and his motivation to reclaim his father's honor is clear and consistent. His interactions with the witch reveal depth, though his "boldly reluctant" attribute could be more explicitly woven into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the treasure hunt driving the narrative forward logically. The connection between beginning and end is strong, and the pacing is excellent for the word limit. The ritual's climax feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (hissing snapdragons, glowing petals) enhancing the eerie, magical atmosphere. The setting deeply influences the plot and character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (telescope as clarity, garden as doubt) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme of inherited burdens is explored with nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The witch's backstory and Garrick's familial ties add depth. Metaphors ("spilled salt" constellations) are inventive. Only minor stiffness in phrasing holds it back from perfection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. Creative fusion of fantasy and emotional stakes.</comment>
