<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blacksmith's motivations and personality are vividly portrayed, with her "professionally wild" nature and artistic drive clearly influencing her actions. Her dialogue with the boy adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the quarantine and dragon-building serving as clear catalysts. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending’s inevitability slightly undercuts tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ozone station and dawn setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (flag’s stiffness, industrial rain) enhancing the mood. The quarantine zone’s eeriness contrasts well with the child’s presence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (flag as dragon’s heart) and subtext (freedom’s duality). The ending is poignant, and the prose is lyrical without being overwrought. Dialogue feels organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("freedom’s a fire"). Avoids clichés, and the emotional nuance (e.g., the boy’s dread) feels authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a resonant whole. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving a lingering meditation on impermanence and defiance.</comment>
