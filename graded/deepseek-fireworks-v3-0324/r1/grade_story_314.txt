<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's exhaustion and grief are palpable, driving her actions and reactions with emotional depth. Her motivation to fix past regrets is clear and consistent, though her sudden acceptance of the supernatural could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the drumbeat and ghostly encounter propelling Mira toward catharsis. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the seafloor clearing feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kelp forest and bioluminescent specter create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frosted breath, sand spirals) elevate the setting, though the "blue flame" revelation is slightly overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bread box as legacy, drum as grief) and layered subtext (bureaucracy vs. healing) make this story resonate. The ending is both satisfying and open-ended, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of utopian dystopia and tribal mysticism is inventive, though the "laughing tears" tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers with emotional and thematic depth.</comment>
