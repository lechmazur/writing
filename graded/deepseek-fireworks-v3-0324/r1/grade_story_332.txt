<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her solitary, artistic nature. Her actions reveal a nuanced blend of vulnerability and resolve, though her "fiercely gentle" attribute could be more explicitly woven into her decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to sacrifice. The pacing is effective, though the transition into the garden's hidden realm feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered, with sensory details (jasmine, static, bioluminescence) enhancing the eerie, intimate atmosphere. The setting amplifies both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the notepad as confession, the dome as fracture) and subtext (grief as a language). The ending is hauntingly purposeful, leaving room for interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of sci-fi and poetic mysticism feels fresh, though a few phrases ("sentient tapestry") edge toward overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the lingering question of Elara's fate elevates it beyond the page.</comment>
