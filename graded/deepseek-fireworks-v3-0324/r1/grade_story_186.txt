<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect is tight, with the carnival and sculpture serving as elegant pivots, though the artist’s parallel action feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (The Tower, mercury turning gold) and a resonant theme of creation-as-destruction elevate the narrative, though the ending’s optimism slightly softens its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "spiderwebs" for cracks) and Lira’s distinct voice avoid cliché, but the carnival’s abrupt introduction hints at AI-like pacing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story’s brevity feels intentional, with elements like the quartz sculpture and thermometer seamlessly serving its thematic depth.</comment>
