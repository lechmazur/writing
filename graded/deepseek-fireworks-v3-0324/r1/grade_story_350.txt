<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The puppeteer's backstory and emotional depth are vividly conveyed through her interactions with the wedding gown and stamp album, revealing a nuanced, grief-driven motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the discovery of the gown and stamps driving a clear, haunting arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the temple's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Greek temple and puzzle event aftermath create a rich, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (cold fabric, whispering pages) deepen immersion, though the setting's connection to the stamps feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (tears as coordinates, stamps as absences) and subtext (mother's fate). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with layered emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("symphony of truth"). Avoids clich√©s, though "irritatingly perfect" leans slightly generic. Emotional nuance is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache. Only minor quibbles with the temple's integration.</comment>
