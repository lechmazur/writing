<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The puzzle maker's obsession and spiritual decay are vividly portrayed, but his "optimistically bitter" attribute could be more deeply integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the string and letters driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent, though the mechanism's reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and fog create a haunting atmosphere, perfectly mirroring the character's turmoil. Sensory details (e.g., "salt-thick fog") are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the string as guilt, the lighthouse as failing soul) and a resonant theme of buried secrets elevate this beyond the surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, though "lethargic excitement" slightly strains credibility. Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("sleeping serpent").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story's depth. The ending lingers, balancing hope and bitterness with precision.</comment>
