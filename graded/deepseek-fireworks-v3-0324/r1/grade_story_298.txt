<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The chameleon's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his role as an actor and solver of mysteries. His distinct voice and actions reveal a complex, layered character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the oil-era backdrop feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The palace's ruinous atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the ghostly tension. Sunlight through debris is a recurring motif that deepens the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the dress, scales) and subtext (truth vs. illusion). The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the prose elevates the emotional impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. Leaves a lingering question about performance as redemption.</comment>
