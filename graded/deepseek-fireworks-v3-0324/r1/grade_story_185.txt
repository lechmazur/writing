<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The collector's motivation is clear and compelling, her actions deeply aligned with her obsession with potential. Her "infuriatingly calm" demeanor contrasts beautifully with the chaos she unleashes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the pencil stub and Mozart's key driving the action logically. The ending feels both conclusive and open, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Probability Mapping Center is vividly realized, its liquid crystal walls and dissolving geometry enhancing the story's surreal tone. Sensory details (stardust, sonatas) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (pencil as blade, keys as cipher) and layered themes (potential vs. control). The ending lingers, and the prose is lyrical without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The concept of "buried talents" is fresh, and the collector's voice feels distinct. No AI-generated tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for resonance. A standout piece with depth and ingenuity.</comment>
