<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is hauntingly clear, her actions deeply aligned with her grief and role as a mender of illusions. Her "methodically playful" approach to indoctrination reveals layers of trauma and control.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's temporal leaps are handled with precision, each dreamer's encounter advancing the theme. The ending lingers, though the radio static device slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin is a masterstroke—corroded grandeur mirroring Veyra's psyche. Sensory details (swaying shadows, frayed gauze) immerse the reader in the story's eerie melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the ghost costume as both relic and tool, the letters as temporal stitches. Subtext about war's cyclical violence elevates the narrative beyond its surreal premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Startlingly original. No clichés; the "calm frenzy" tone and shared-dream mechanics feel fresh. Emotion is shown through visceral details (e.g., the engineer's scream becoming a laugh).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The brevity amplifies its impact, leaving the reader with the weight of Veyra's unresolved grief and the zeppelin's whispering ghosts.</comment>
