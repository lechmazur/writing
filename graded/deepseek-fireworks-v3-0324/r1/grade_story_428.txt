<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voss's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his obsession could be more nuanced. His "rarely authentic" attribute is subtly woven into his actions, though his final realization feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The temple's reveal as a mirror of his compulsions is a strong resolution, though the transition from doubt to epiphany could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple's decaying grandeur and the blotter's cold brass are vividly rendered. The atmosphere amplifies Voss's isolation, though the parakeet's intrusion feels slightly jarring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (vines vs. stars) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending's emotional resonance is potent, though the dealer's voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The prose is precise, though "daring caution" as a tone isn't fully realized—it leans more toward desperation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
