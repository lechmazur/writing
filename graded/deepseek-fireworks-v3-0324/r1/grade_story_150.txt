<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias Thorn's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vividly drawn, with clear motivation (curiosity) and distinct voice. Luminara's ambition and precision contrast well, though her backstory feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with the dice and shifting text driving action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory dome is richly evoked, with sensory details (hissing pipes, clattering dice) enhancing atmosphere. Setting and concept merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (serpent, keyhole) and subtext (truth vs. manipulation). Ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "fractured clockwork") are fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, and style is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about fate and free will. Creative and cohesive.</comment>
