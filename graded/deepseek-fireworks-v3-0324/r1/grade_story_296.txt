<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivations and actions are vividly portrayed, with her resilience and resourcefulness shining through. The chopsticks symbolize her duality—broken yet sharp—adding depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the reactor crisis and hidden instructions driving momentum. The resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes Vey's arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken chopsticks, charcoal maps) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s thematic resonance—"two broken things leaning together"—is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a distinct voice avoid clichés. The twist on "spiritual paths" as mechanical resilience is original, though Vey’s guilt-triumph duality verges on trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste of beauty in crisis.</comment>
