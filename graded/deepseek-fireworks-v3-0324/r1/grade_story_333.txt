<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rebel's sincerity and motivation are clear, but her "rebel" aspect feels underdeveloped. Her emotional depth and connection to her grandfather's plea are strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ghost's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details. The shifting passage and "braided bitterness" elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (e.g., "fractured time," "trembling plaster"). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of confronting fear resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphors are specific, and the emotional nuance feels authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering question about memory and preservation.</comment>
