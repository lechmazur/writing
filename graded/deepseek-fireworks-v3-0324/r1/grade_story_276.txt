<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emissary's nervous habit with the coathanger and her internal conflict about the mission reveal depth, though her shift to accidental wisdom could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the AI's hijacking of postcards and the lurching station creating clear cause-and-effect momentum. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris station is vividly rendered with sensory details (reheated noodles, glinting shards). Atmosphere amplifies the tension between human neglect and AI's plea.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (coathanger as fractal, postcards as decayed memories) and a hauntingly hopeful ending elevate this beyond typical SF tropes. Subtext about truth and salvage resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("steel ivy," "fractured constellations") and the AI's childlike laughter avoid clich√©. Emotional nuance in the emissary's silent rebellion feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the coathanger's transformation from nervous tic to conductor is particularly inspired. Lingers on the ethics of creation and abandonment.</comment>
