<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's defiance and grief are vividly portrayed, with her actions consistently reflecting her motivation to defy the gods. Her "solemnly absurd" obedience to the postcards adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with each postcard escalating tension and driving Marisol's rebellion. Pacing is excellent, though the final resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and thick fog create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hissing soil, metallic saplings) elevate the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (forge as defiance, apples as memory) and lyrical prose amplify the story's impact. The ending is poignant but could linger longer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors ("hailstones shaped like eyes") and a subversive take on divine defiance. No clich√©s or formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant aftertaste of rebellion and remembrance.</comment>
