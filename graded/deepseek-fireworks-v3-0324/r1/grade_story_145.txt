<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her defection and rosebud symbolizing her defiance and empathy. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her "uncertainly certain" mantra could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the echo test and rosebud serving as effective catalysts. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition to the cavern feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with the ruined library and mercury mirror creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, petrichor) enhance the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (rosebud, heart of light) and subtext (empathy vs. control). The ending is satisfying, though Veyra's confrontation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors (roots as labyrinths) and a subversion of secret society tropes. Some phrases ("frozen starlight") edge toward clich√© but are redeemed by context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the rosebud and echo test driving the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
