<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moss's docile yet bruiser nature is compelling, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract. His calmness in violence is a standout trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the baton and labyrinth driving action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution leans poetic over concrete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersiveâ€”carnivorous orchids, solstice drums, and glass corridors create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (baton as myth-conductor) and layered themes (love as root systems) elevate the prose. Ending is resonant but slightly opaque.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh metaphors (e.g., "love as a root system"). Minor risk of over-poetic abstraction in the climax.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into a mythic whole. The brevity feels intentional, though some thematic weight could be sharper.</comment>
