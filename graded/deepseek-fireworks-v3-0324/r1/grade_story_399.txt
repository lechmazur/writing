<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias Thorn's grumpy exterior and deep-seated trauma are vividly portrayed, with his motivation to quell inner turmoil clear and consistent. His trembling hands and spectral confrontation reveal layers of grief and guilt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the mandala and ash-driven visions logically escalating Elias's reckoning. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the witch's absence feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scrying room's starlight and shifting mandala create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ash, damp soil) deepen the mood, aligning perfectly with Elias's emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (constellations as scars, the eclipse/sun transformation) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, with Elias's tears as "minuscule galaxies" showcasing masterful craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("trauma as a constellation") and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©s. The prose is vivid yet purposeful, with no AI-generic phrasing. Originality shines in the mandala's role.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the narrative cohesively. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on grief. A standout example of literary microfiction.</comment>
