<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astronomer's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her past and the world's emotional decay. Her actions reveal a nuanced struggle between duty and rebellion, though her 'awe' could be more explicitly tied to her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the idol's destruction serving as a logical climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the moral dilemma's resolution could be slightly more textured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (frost-rimed glass, groaning ice) elevate the setting to a character in itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (veil, seeds, idol) and lyrical prose create profound subtext. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, though the theme of 'awe as resurrection' could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "fractures echoing the splintered sky"). Minimal cliché, though the "wounded ghost" simile slightly falters. Nuanced emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving resonant questions. Only the 'rationally organic' concept slightly strains the otherwise seamless integration.</comment>
