<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her past trauma, but her "lost heiress" backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. Her reckless precision and bitter optimism are compelling, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from fleeing to unification. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the lab's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details (ozone, bioluminescence). The setting enhances the fractured reality concept beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (parking stub, watch) and subtext. The ending is satisfying yet open, with a strong thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés, though the "lost heiress" trope is a minor weak point.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about rebirth and time.</comment>
