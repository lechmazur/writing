<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's impulsiveness and whimsy are vividly portrayed, driving her actions and dialogue with consistency. Her motivation to right a historical wrong is clear and deeply personal, though her "cartwheeling through chaos" could be more integrated into the climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Lyra's ascent to the fortress to the resolution of the ghostly conflict. The meteor shower and music sheet's role in the climax are logical and satisfying, though the "tackle" action feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (e.g., "moss-slick stairs," "roaring waterfall") enhancing the mood. The dusk timeframe and celestial elements amplify the story's magical realism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with potent symbolism (the music sheet as unspoken apologies) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant, though the ghost's defeat could feel less abrupt. Lyra's voice is distinct and engaging.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The whimsical tone and emotional inheritance theme are nuanced, though some phrases ("spectral fingers") edge toward purple prose. The meteor-star connection is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that balances its elements elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression of mended legacy. Minor quibbles with pacing near the climax.</comment>
