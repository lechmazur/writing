<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's trembling hands and sleepless decoding reveal her dedication and anxiety, but her motivation to map the trails feels slightly underdeveloped beyond the dragon scale.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the verdict deadline and marble code driving urgency. Pacing is excellent, though the dragon's backstory could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The floating marketplace and "mundane miracles" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (hissing balloons, humming scale) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scale as choice, coded marble) and a resonant theme (immortality's cost) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "technically wild" attribute feels slightly forced. The dragon's sacrifice subverts tropes effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and layered, with elements serving the story. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
