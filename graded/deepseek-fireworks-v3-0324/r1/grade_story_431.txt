<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's introversion and dancer's precision are vividly portrayed, with her knitting constellations serving as a compelling rebellion. Her motivation to escape the wasteland is clear and consistent, though her "affectionate detachment" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the cipher machine's output driving the narrative forward. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the resolution's cosmic leap feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cipher decoder’s office and wasteland setting are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (sandstorms, comet-dust thread) enhancing immersion. The tone complements the concept beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (knitting as rebellion, starlight as escape) and symbolism. The ending is satisfyingly transformative, with layers of meaning about art and logic. Writing style elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Fresh metaphors ("a pas de deux with gravity") and nuanced emotion. The narrative maintains a consistent, distinctive style without purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are masterfully integrated, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, prompting reflection on creativity and survival. A cohesive, inventive whole.</comment>
