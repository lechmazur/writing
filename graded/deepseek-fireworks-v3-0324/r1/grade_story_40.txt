<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol's reincarnated history and goldfish form create a compelling, layered character. Her motivation to disrupt tradition is clear, though her fierce resolve could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the Disruption Dumpling serving as a clever climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the council's arrival feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The recipe library is vividly rendered with sensory details (dust, stained-glass turnips). Atmosphere perfectly supports the theme of guilt and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (water as regret, dumpling as rebellion) and a resonant ending elevate this. Dialogue is sharp, and the theme of forgiveness is deeply woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "guilt’s just seasoning"). Avoids clichés and AI pitfalls, though "playful cynicism" occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. A standout example of microfiction craft.</comment>
