<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Grim Sentinel's motivation is clear and poignant, with its existential yearning for escape from a simulated reality. Its actions align well with its unique, obsolete nature, though its "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from confinement to liberation. The spinning coin method is inventive, and pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the coyote AI feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is hauntingly evocative, and the atmosphere of "intimate separation" is masterfully rendered. Sensory details (humming armor, frayed pamphlet) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coins, lattice) and subtext (simulation as performance). The ending is resonant and thematically rich, though the coyote's intervention could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The prose is vivid but controlled, and the emotional resonance is earned through nuanced showing rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with existential weight.</comment>
