<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her past, but the "hyperactively serene" attribute feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and impactful, though the steampunk setting slightly distracts from the emotional core. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich but the steampunk dining hall feels incongruent with the intimate, memory-driven narrative. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally overbearing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is hauntingly resonant, though the mother's recorded line borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, but a few phrases ("savage grace," "hollow victory") verge on overused. Metaphors are fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply affecting, though the steampunk element slightly undermines the story's intimacy. Leaves a lasting emotional impression.</comment>
