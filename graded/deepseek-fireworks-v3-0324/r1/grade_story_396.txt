<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Léa's motivations are clear and consistent, her charm and forgetfulness adding depth. Her actions align with her urban forager persona, though her "disinterested passion" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect progression. The negotiation and chance encounter drive the story effectively, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault and Sainte-Chapelle connection are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere. The setting amplifies the fragment's mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glass as "Paris’s breath"), layered themes (preservation vs. vitality), and a resonant ending. Dialogue is sharp, and the UV light reveal is a standout moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the fragment’s duality (relic vs. living artifact) lingers. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
