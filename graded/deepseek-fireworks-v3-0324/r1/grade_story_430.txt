<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vyrra's scars, the child’s drawing, and her hunger for stars create a layered, distinct character. Her voice is sharp, and her actions align with her tragic, defiant motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with a clear arc from solitude to transformation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the Crow-Cage's role could be slightly more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope park is vividly rendered, with prismatic hedges and liquid starlight amplifying the grotesque charm. Sensory details (honey, frost, charred cheek) immerse deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext (stars as lies, the drawing’s erasure). The ending lingers, and the conflict—hunger vs. fear—resonates. Dialogue is razor-sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The Crow-Cage’s mocking verses and Vyrra’s glass-bone transformation feel fresh. Language is ornate but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The park’s margins, generational cycles, and grotesque charm serve the story’s depth. Leaves a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
