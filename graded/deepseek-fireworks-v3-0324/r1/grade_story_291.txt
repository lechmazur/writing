<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's defiance and scars are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her "voice" is distinct, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with logical cause-and-effect and effective pacing. The mirror maze's collapse feels slightly abrupt but serves the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and cosmic echoes create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glass shards, auroras) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Striking use of symbolism (rope, mirrors) and subtext (prejudice as a maze). The ending is satisfying, with layered themes of defiance and identity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "calculated wilderness") are inventive. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about self-perception versus legacy.</comment>
