<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her heritage, but her "aimless" trait feels underutilized given her purposeful actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the hopscotch cipher driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, though the archivist's abrupt shift could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (saffron, snowflakes) enhancing the archive's haunting weight. The setting and object are perfectly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (recipes as treaties, spices as guardians) and a layered theme of cultural preservation elevate the story. The ending lingers with poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "grilled symbols" metaphor slightly strains credulity. Avoids clich√©s and showcases a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the brevity feeling intentional. Leaves the reader haunted by the tension between loss and renewal.</comment>
