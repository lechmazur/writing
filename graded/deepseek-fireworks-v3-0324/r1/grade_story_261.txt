<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's borderline immortality and grief over lost ecosystems are compelling, but her motivation could be more explicitly tied to her lover's plea earlier in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from decay to revival, though the "launch" action's connection to the garden's transformation could be slightly more intuitive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The world-building is exceptional, with the particle acceleration garden and poisoned soil creating a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, crackling air) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (ink as a map of decay, the oak as an ignition chamber) and emotional resonance, though the ending's shift to hope could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (principles that "bent like steel") and no clich√©s. The fusion of botanical and atomic matter is ingenious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question: Can revival outpace entropy?</comment>
