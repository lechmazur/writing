<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swordswoman's guilt and motivation are vividly portrayed, driving her actions with emotional depth. Her "reservedly bold" nature is subtly but effectively shown through her interactions and decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The Door of Release concept ties the beginning and end together elegantly, though the historians' role feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, blending the neon shop's grit with the rosebush's symbolism. Sensory details (ozone, wooden mask) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship—rich symbolism, layered themes of guilt and release, and a hauntingly ambiguous ending. The prose is precise yet poetic, avoiding purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (rose petal as "dying flame") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés, and the fusion of tribal mysticism and urban decay feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the nature of absolution.</comment>
