<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the action of upholding the chorus driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly immersive, with the nectar facility and star paths enhancing the ethereal grit. Sensory details (e.g., "iridescent nectar dimmed like guttered stars") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism in the cane, metaphor in the chorus). The ending is poignant, and the theme of defiance against cosmic order resonates deeply.</comment>
