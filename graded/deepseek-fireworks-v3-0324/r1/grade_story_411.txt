<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gear's motivation is deeply intertwined with her mechanical nature and unresolved grief, creating a compelling, distinct character. Her actions and voice are consistent and reveal layers of her psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from Gear's duty to her personal revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and star river are breathtakingly original, with sensory details (glyph-etched leaves, gasoline-rot roses) that immerse and elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mechanical trees, fractured confessions) and a hauntingly satisfying ending. The prose is lyrical but purposeful, with subtext about silence and redemption.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clichés. The fusion of mechanics and organic decay feels fresh, and emotional nuance is shown, not told (e.g., her wrench’s dirge).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, profound vignette. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering ache of unresolved time.</comment>
