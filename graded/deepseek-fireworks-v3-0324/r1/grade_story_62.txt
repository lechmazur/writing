<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher's rare honesty and deceitful reflex create a compelling contradiction, but his motivation to "rewrite existence" feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly coiled, with the butcher's arrival as a pivotal moment. Pacing is excellent, though the ending's ambiguity might frustrate some.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Orchard amphitheater and sewer pipe are masterfully juxtaposed. Sensory details (rot, moonlight) deepen the atmosphere of decay and delusion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (truth as pest, roots as scripture). The lie to the butcher is a devastating climax. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice, though the "code of existence" phrasing borders on pretentious. Metaphors (river, cockroach) are fresh and unsettling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The seed as both hope and poison lingers. Only the philosopher's grand ambition feels slightly unmoored.</comment>
