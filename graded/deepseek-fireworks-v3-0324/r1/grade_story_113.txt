<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's hesitance and "shyly loud" contradiction are well-developed, but her motivation to unravel sorrow could be more explicitly tied to her backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the dream-hopping transitions risk slight abruptness in this word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Xenon-lit tunnel and "fragility of time" create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere; sensory details (e.g., plushâ€™s glowing seams) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (tapestry, plush) and subtext; ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant. Minor deduction for over-reliance on "irony" as a narrative crutch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("trenches filled with liquid clockwork"). Only slight stiffness in "shyly loud" repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story elegantly; brevity feels intentional. Lingers in memory due to emotional precision.</comment>
