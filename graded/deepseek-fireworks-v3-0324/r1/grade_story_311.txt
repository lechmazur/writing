<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, anchored by the photograph and his sister's fate. His actions align with his rebellion, though his "serendipitously stubborn" attribute could be more explicitly woven into his decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from tension to rebellion. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the EarthGov envoy's swift alignment feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered, with sensory details (spectral light, blighted orchids) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting amplifies the stakes of control and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (photograph as vow, greenhouse as suffocation) and a resonant ending elevate this. The prose is lyrical yet purposeful, with subtext about oppression and renewal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The lunar rebellion premise is inventive, and Kael's quiet defiance feels authentically human. Minor quibble: "serene anger" slightly over-explains.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where all elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about the cost of freedom.</comment>
