<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions revealing depth—his hunger vs. his moral compass. His 'voice' is distinct, blending cynicism and reluctant heroism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the marbles and hatpin driving action logically. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cyberpunk atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (acidic rain, neon glare). The setting enhances both action and theme organically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hatpin as hope), evocative prose, and a resonant ending. The conflict is small-scale but deeply human, and the theme of decency shines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The hatpin's dual purpose and Kael's "fervent apathy" feel uniquely human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about sacrifice in a broken world.</comment>
