<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra's timid yet determined nature is vividly portrayed, and her motivation to mend fractures is clear and consistent. Her actions align well with her established traits, though her 'seraphic' quality feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from promise to resolution. The scoreboard as a cipher and the banner as a collective memorial are inventive and logically connected. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, blending industrial decay with arcade nostalgia. Sensory details (dust, flickering lights, the hum of wires) deepen immersion. The Greek temple reimagining is slightly underutilized but evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (ribbon as thread, scoreboard as memorial) and subtext (pain woven into strength). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant. Writing style elevates the story's emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "laughter tangled with tears") are fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told. The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional weight. Creative and deeply thoughtful.</comment>
