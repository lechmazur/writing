<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is clear and compelling, blending defiance and reverence. Her "patiently frantic" demeanor and distinct voice elevate her beyond a mere archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled, with the storm's escalation mirroring her resolve. Pacing is impeccable, and the fractal metaphor ties the climax to the opening elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sky burial site is visceral and thematically resonant. Sensory details (ozone, burnt sage) and the prism's spectral light create a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("lightning’s kiss," "fractal to fractal") and layered subtext about defiance vs. surrender. The ending’s prism metaphor lingers with philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "storm clouds coiled like serpents") and a unique fusion of cyberpunk and mysticism. Avoids cliché, though "euphoric agitation" slightly strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s core theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for awe without sacrificing cohesion or depth.</comment>
