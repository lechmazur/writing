<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her actions align with her unknowing heir status, but her "frolicsome regret" tone could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with peeling paint layers driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The magnetic mountain and abandoned movie house create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, tarnished spoon) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spoon as map, mural as legacy) and a satisfying ending. The dialogue with the projector figure is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("chaos hates a co-author"). No clich√©s; the prose is vivid without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the story cohesively. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
