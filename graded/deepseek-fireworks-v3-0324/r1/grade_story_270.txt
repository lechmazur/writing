<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer's cynicism and arrogance are well-defined, but his shift toward vulnerability feels slightly rushed. His motivation is clear, though his final realization could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax's resolution could linger slightly longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—the lighthouse library and tarnished globe are vividly rendered. Sensory details (dust, fractured light) deepen the eerie nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (echoes, ash) and layered subtext elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the conjurer's grin feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("constellations tarnished to ghosts"). Avoids clichés, though the "shared isolation" theme leans slightly toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that lingers. The elements serve the story masterfully, and the brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
