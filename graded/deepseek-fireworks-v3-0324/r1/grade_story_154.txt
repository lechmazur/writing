<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aoife's "strongly weak" attribute is vividly portrayed, shaping her actions and voice. Her motivation is clear, though her poetic failure feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc. The ink pot's urgency drives momentum, though the bard's interruption slightly disrupts pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—neon-lit Celtic village feels immersive and original. Sensory details (humming ink pot, VR mourners) elevate atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly. The word limit feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about modern mythmaking.</comment>
