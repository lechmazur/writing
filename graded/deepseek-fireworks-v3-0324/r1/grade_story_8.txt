<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and compelling, blending rebellion with ancestral legacy. His actions align well with his empirically rebellious nature, though his dazed state could be more consistently woven into his decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Alaric's rebellion to the garden's transformation. Pacing is excellent, and cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the resolution with Voss feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The Sound Garden is vividly realized, with sensory details (singing ivy, glass orchids) enhancing the atmosphere. The setting perfectly complements the theme of cosmic harmony and chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using rich metaphors (chalk as a wand) and symbolism (equations as auroras). The ending is satisfying, and the theme of breaking inherited constraints resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of math and music. The tone avoids clich√©s, and the emotional resonance is achieved through subtext and atmosphere rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering impression of rebellion and cosmic possibility.</comment>
