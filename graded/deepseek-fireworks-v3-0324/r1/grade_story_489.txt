<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observer's spectral inertia and her transformation are compelling, but her backstory as the first dancer feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the whistle and whale's call driving the narrative, though the dancer's immediate understanding of the whistle's purpose could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse and storm create a vivid, haunting atmosphere, with sensory details (whale's dirge, salt-stained silence) enhancing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as undercurrent, dance as ritual) and a resonant theme of tradition as a current elevate the story, though the ending's emotional punch could linger longer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "aggressive kindness" and "brazen calm" verge on over-poetic phrasing. The whale's call and lighthouse are fresh, avoiding clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that balances brevity with depth, leaving a haunting impression of cyclical renewal.</comment>
