<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The warrior's boastfulness is subtly woven into his defiance, but his motivation to escape feels slightly underdeveloped given the complexity of the fabricated reality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the balloon pops and rewiring action creating a coherent, escalating tension. The resolution is abrupt but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The wasp nest setting is vividly immersive, with sensory details (hum, latex, wax) amplifying the atmosphere of "precise madness."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lint as code, loom as reality-weaver) and a haunting ending elevate this beyond surface narrative. The warrior’s raw laugh lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no clichés, fresh metaphors ("lint-lined ark"), and a subversive take on fabricated worlds. Voice is distinct and controlled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce brilliantly; the pocket lint’s transformation into a key is a masterstroke. Only the soliloquies feel slightly underutilized.</comment>
