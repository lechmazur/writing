<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sassy cook's distinct voice and clear motivation to disrupt order are well-executed, though her academic mischief could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the camera's glitch-revealing function driving the chaos logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, inventive whole. The brevity enhances its punch.</comment>
