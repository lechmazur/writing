<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with his cautious smuggler persona and complex motivations. His "meticulously impulsive" nature and empathy as an "unfinished sacrament" add depth, though his "enthusiastic apathy" could be more consistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the painter's confession driving revelations about the rigged algorithms. Pacing is strong, though the transition to Elias's personal revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drought prediction center is hauntingly atmospheric, with the UV butterfly and sterile lobby enhancing the tension. Sensory details (e.g., "air conditioning hummed like a trapped wasp") are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, drought) and layered subtext (water as truth, empathy as theft) elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the "enthusiastic apathy" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("empathy was theft") and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the "musical memories" concept slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on manipulation and memory.</comment>
