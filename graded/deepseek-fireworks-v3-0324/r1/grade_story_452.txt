<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to her father's legacy. Her actions align with her softhearted yet defiant nature, though her "champion" role could be more explicitly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from decay to defiance. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the corporate enforcers' arrival feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is vividly rendered, with stellar sensory details (neon rain, glitching holograms). The planetarium and police station contrast beautifully, amplifying the theme of fractured narratives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (buckle, constellations) and a hauntingly hopeful ending elevate this. The black hole's song is a masterstroke, though Vex's dialogue could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The "organic patterns" motif is fresh, though the "Great Unspooling" backstory leans slightly on genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical gem. The elements serve the story flawlessly, and the brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant aftertaste of defiance.</comment>
