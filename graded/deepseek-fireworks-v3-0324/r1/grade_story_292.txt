<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ezra's transformation from raider to storyteller is compelling, with clear motivation and distinct voice. The mug as a relic of his past adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from defiance to redemption. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the museum raid feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The speakeasy's atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (velvet, chamomile, amber cracks) enhancing mood. Setting and object are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (mug as compass) and subtext. The ending is poignant and resonant, with layered themes of redemption and storytelling as survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
