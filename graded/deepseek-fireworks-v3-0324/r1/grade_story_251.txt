<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara's ambivalence and prophetic burden are vividly rendered, though her "bashful arrogance" could be more consistently woven into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's cosmic stakes and tight pacing are masterful, but the "final oath" concept feels slightly underdeveloped for its weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lunar colony's atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with sensory details (hissing oxygen, dust) elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (marbles as fractured universes) and a resonant ending balance literary ambition with emotional impact, though the "scoreboard" metaphor borders on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original voice and fresh metaphors ("starlight reached the moon long after its source had died"); only a faint whiff of AI-like precision in the cosmic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with only the "jigsaw puzzle edges" feeling slightly contrived. The brevity serves the story's mythic scale.</comment>
