<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from discovery to sacrifice. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and its dissonant atmosphere are richly evoked, enhancing the story's mood and Aria's isolation. Sensory details (e.g., chimes, vinyl) are masterfully used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's emotional impact is profound, with layered symbolism (vinyl as data, chimes as language). The ending is hauntingly satisfying, and the prose elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of cosmic whales, sonic beacons, and a patchwork ship feels fresh. Nuanced emotion and vivid metaphors stand out.</comment>
