<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vale's grief and desperation are palpable, driving his actions with a razor-sharp focus. His motivation is clear, though his "sober cardsharp" trait feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The ritual's specificity (coffee cooling) adds urgency, though the inkwell's destruction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The island's eerie atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details (driftwood like skeletal fingers, cicada screams muffled by fog) deepening the haunting mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (inkwell as guilt, starlings as liberation) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is poignant, though the specter's appearance could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though "analyzing cameo appearances in strangersâ€™ dreams" borders on convoluted. The emotional core feels genuine, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering ache.</comment>
