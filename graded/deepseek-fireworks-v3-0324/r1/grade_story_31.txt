<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's grief and Lira's defiance are vividly portrayed, with motivations deeply tied to their cyberpunk world. Lira's "endearingly irritating" nature adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven, with the key's revelation and Lira's sprint creating a clear arc. Pacing is brisk but coherent, though the drone confrontation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is a masterstrokeâ€”bioluminescent peaches and corporate drones clash beautifully. Sensory details (holographic fireflies, rotting peaches) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (key as memory, garden as legacy) and subtext (corporate erasure vs. organic resilience). The ending lingers with poetic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("ghost orchard," "data-scythe") and nuanced emotions elevate this beyond typical cyberpunk tropes. Lira's voice feels authentically scrappy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly; the garden's decay mirroring Kael's loss is inspired. The brevity amplifies impact, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
