<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, blending recklessness with deep loyalty. His "impulsively thoughtful" nature is well-integrated, though Lyrin's unraveling could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's abruptness slightly undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The "fractured grace" tone permeates every element, though the social upheaval could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (charcoal, spirals) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though Lyrin's survival feels slightly contrived.</comment>
