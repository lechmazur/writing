<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisela's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past, but her free-spirited herbalist trait feels underdeveloped compared to her academic and emotional struggles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the letters and sewing kit driving the narrative forward logically. The ending feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (salt, wind, mother-of-pearl) enhancing the atmosphere. The coral station and drowned garden are powerfully symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices and subtext, the story evokes longing and resilience. The ending is poignant, though the theme of doubt could be more subtly threaded earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, but a few phrases ("hollow echoes of shame," "brine-scorched wind") edge toward overused lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The brevity feels intentional, though some elements (like the herbalist trait) could be more integrated.</comment>
