<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vessa's motivation is clear and compelling, but her "overzealous" trait could be more pronounced in her actions. Her distinct voice and reactions to the notebook and phantoms reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-and-effect logic is strong, and pacing balances urgency with atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—sensory details and the orchard's chaotic beauty immerse the reader. The setting amplifies the story's themes of decay and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (notebook as legacy, orchard as liminal space) and evocative prose elevate the narrative. The ending resonates, though the goddess's echo could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. Metaphors (e.g., "roots clawing upward") are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown through action and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a haunting, cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about memory and entropy.</comment>
