<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edith's motivation is clear and her "dutifully defiant" nature shines through her actions. The stuffed toy ear adds a unique layer to her character, though its magical realism could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Edith's visions, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The cause-and-effect chain is logical, though the pacing tightens unnaturally at the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "amber prison" setting and sensory details (steam, chili, dust) are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. The atmosphere supports both character and concept effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (quilt, chili, ear) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending is satisfying, though the dialogue ("Read them!") could feel more natural. The theme of gentle rebellion resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The stuffed ear's magic is inventive, and the prose avoids purple tendencies. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. The length feels intentional, and the ending lingers. Creative combination of assigned parts.</comment>
