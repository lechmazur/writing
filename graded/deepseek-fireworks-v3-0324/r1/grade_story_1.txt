<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's phobias and stunt double background are well-integrated, revealing depth through her reactions to the envelope and net. Her motivation to confront fear is clear, though her "dance with madness" could be more explicitly tied to her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the envelope and pyramid leading logically to the net's unraveling. Pacing is excellent, and the garage sale bookends provide cohesion. Minor quibble: the net's connection to echoes feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—mildewed grimoires, fossilized nets, and Velcro sounds create a haunting, tactile world. The library's surreal dread amplifies Clara's journey. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (net as fear, envelope as memory) and a resonant theme—triumph through unraveling—elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the Polaroid's mundanity could be sharper in its emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "net dissolved into salt"). Avoids clichés, and the phobia/stunt double juxtaposition feels inventive. Nuanced handling of fear and memory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale where elements serve the story. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. Combines surreal and mundane with striking originality.</comment>
