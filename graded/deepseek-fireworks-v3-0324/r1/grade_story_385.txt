<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are intriguingly ambiguous, blending scientific curiosity with ethical recklessness. Her "pleasant meddler" persona is distinct, though her backstory could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the glyphs and seeds driving the narrative forward logically. The ending feels earned, though the beach scene's surrealism slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward create a haunting, clinical atmosphere. Sensory details (kelp, flickering monitors) are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (glyphs as seeds, skates as memory vessels) elevates the story. The ending lingers, though the "phytolinguistics" lie feels slightly contrived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity enhances the story's dreamlike quality, leaving room for interpretation.</comment>
