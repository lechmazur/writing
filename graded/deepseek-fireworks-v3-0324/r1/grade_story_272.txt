<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clyde's socially awkward yet deeply introspective nature is vividly portrayed, with his motivation to confront regret through invention feeling both clear and poignant. His "hopefully cynical" self-description adds layers to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the whistle's use and the archive's reversal logic driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The diner's late-shift atmosphere and the archive's eerie glow create a haunting, immersive world. Sensory details (e.g., the whistle's carvings, the jukebox's warped ballad) deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (the sapling glyph, the whistle's decay) and subtext (regret vs. renewal). The ending is resonant, and the dialogue ("Sentiment’s a design flaw") crackles with purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The "forgotten arts" concept and reversed-trails mechanics feel fresh, and the prose is vivid without being overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
