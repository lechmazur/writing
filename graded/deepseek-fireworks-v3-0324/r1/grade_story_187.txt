<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wanderer's stoicism and motivation are vividly portrayed, with her resolve and backstory adding depth. Her "brash tenderness" voice is distinct and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The urgency of the erased formula and the floorboard's role drive the narrative efficiently within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted—bleak yet charged with magic. Sensory details (brittle leaves, chalk-dust) and the "mesmerizingly bland" sky deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (floorboard as ledger) and subtext ("necessary lies rot if unused"). The ending is hauntingly purposeful, leaving thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The handling of "necessary lies" and the teacher's blurred face feel fresh. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity enhances its impact. Lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
