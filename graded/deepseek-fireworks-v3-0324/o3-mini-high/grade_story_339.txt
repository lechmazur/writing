<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong portrayal of internal conflict and motivation, though the character's "joyless" nature could be more vividly shown through actions rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly abstract; the seesaw method feels forced. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thoughtful, though the seesaw element weakens momentum. Leaves a lingering sense of resolution.</comment>
