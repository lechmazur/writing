<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oliver's agoraphobia and mayoral role create a compelling tension, but his motivation to rewrite destiny feels slightly abstract. His actions align well, but deeper introspection could sharpen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the snuffbox, but the transition from study to dunes feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the resolution could be more concrete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with rain and dunes enhancing mood. The snuffbox's connection to the setting is evocative, though "whispering dunes" slightly clashes with the urban backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of legacy is poignant. The ending is purposeful but could linger more. Subtext is strong, though some emotions are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, but phrases like "eager resignation" verge on overused. Sensory details are vivid, though the tone occasionally wavers into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story feels slightly constrained by its length. The snuffbox and rain rhythm are inventive, though the dunes feel underutilized.</comment>
