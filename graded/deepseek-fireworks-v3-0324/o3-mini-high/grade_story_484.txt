<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brewer's motivation is clear but his "uniquely generic" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his resolve, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the rite initiation, but the protest subplot feels tangential. Pacing is strong, though the ending resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details. The mansion graveyard and encroaching darkness are expertly intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is purposeful but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional tropes (e.g., "fractured reflections"). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks a fully distinct style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the protest timeframe feels forced. The brevity serves the story, leaving a resonant, if slightly uneven, impression.</comment>
