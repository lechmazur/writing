<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The birdwatcher's motivation is intriguing but somewhat abstract; his "anxiously relaxed" demeanor and yearning for cosmic chaos are compelling but could be more concretely tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract imagery; the cosmic blink and mask discovery drive the narrative, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with the leaf-cluttered office and marble floor reflections creating a haunting, bureaucratic limbo. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the theme of nonviolence vs. cosmic chaos sometimes clashes tonally. The ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is high, though some phrases verge on purple prose. The birdwatcher's voice and the mask's symbolism feel fresh, but the "braided bitterness" tone occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but dense; the elements serve the narrative, though the brevity forces some conceptual heavy lifting. Leaves a lingering, if slightly muddled, impression.</comment>
