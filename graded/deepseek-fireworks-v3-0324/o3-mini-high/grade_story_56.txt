<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear but his "energetically lethargic" stride feels contrived. His swindler persona and inner turmoil are compelling, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has coherence but feels rushed. The dropped book meet-cute is abrupt, and the resolution of Marcus's arc is hinted at but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard/skyscraper setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details (rust, gnarled roots) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (blank price tag, rejuvenating circuitry) and subtext. The ending is purposeful but could resonate deeper with sharper emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the setting and concept, but some phrases ("energetically lethargic") feel forced. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the tight word limit strains cohesion. The story lingers but lacks the polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
