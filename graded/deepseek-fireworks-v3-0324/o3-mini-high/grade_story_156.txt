<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The diplomat's confusion and fervor are compelling, but his motivation to liberalize traditions feels somewhat abstract and could be more concretely tied to his personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot meanders with poetic introspection but lacks a tight cause-and-effect structure. The ending resolves thematically but not narratively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subterranean setting is vividly atmospheric, though the "eerie salt mine" concept isn't fully exploited. Sensory details (lanterns, echoes) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (metaphors, symbolism) elevate the prose. The theme of transformation resonates, though some abstractions dilute emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in its blending of elements, but phrases like "joyfully tragic" verge on clich√©. The diplomat's voice occasionally feels overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ambitious and cohesive, but the word limit strains under thematic weight. The spare computer key and birds feel more decorative than integral.</comment>
