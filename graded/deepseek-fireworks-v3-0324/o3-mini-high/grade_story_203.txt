<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's stage fright and exorcist role create an intriguing tension, but his motivation to "sculpt possibility" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though deeper nuance could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent, with the key-turning moment as a pivot, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. Pacing balances urgency and reflection well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orbital debris and crumbling workshop merge beautifully with the tone, creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "clattering machines") are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wildflowers, key) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending resonates with thematic clarity and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into florid phrasing ("defiant hush"). The cosmic/exorcism blend feels fresh, though some tropes (ancestral deceit) lack subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the setting and theme shining. The brevity feels intentional, though a few forced inclusions (toy assembly) slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
