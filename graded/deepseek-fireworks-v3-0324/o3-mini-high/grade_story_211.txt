<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lucky Gambler's motivation is clear but his "lucky" attribute feels underutilized; his actions align with defiance but lack deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the spin-the-bottle method feels contrived; pacing is strong, though the ending resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story feels constrained by its assigned components rather than elevated by them.</comment>
