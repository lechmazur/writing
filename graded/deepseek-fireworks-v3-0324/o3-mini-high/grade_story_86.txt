<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; the "brittle spirit" and "fierce determination" clash tonally. The candle as a symbol is effective, but his "reckless bravery" feels sudden.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot meanders between past and present without tight cause-and-effect. The festival encounter feels tacked on, disrupting pacing. Resolution is poetic but lacks narrative thrust.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cyberpunk and ancient timeline imagery blend strikingly, though the data center feels underutilized. Neon and candlelight create vivid contrast, but sensory details are sparse beyond visuals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (candle, dawn) and lyrical prose, but emotional impact is diluted by overwrought phrasing. Theme of truth vs. deceit is compelling but overly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original cyberpunk-archer fusion, but "borrowed dawn" and "bones of ancient timeline" verge on clich√©. Some metaphors (e.g., "neon veins") feel recycled from genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain logic (archer in a data center?). Lyrical style compensates for uneven pacing, though the word limit exposes rushed transitions.</comment>
