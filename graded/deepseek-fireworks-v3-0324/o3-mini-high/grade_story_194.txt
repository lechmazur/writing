<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gideon's motivation is clear but his "gracefully awkward" charm feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The coded letter drives the narrative, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing suffers from the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ossuary-restaurant setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. Atmosphere enhances the story's eerie, mysterious tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, but the emotional impact is uneven. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance. Theme of renewal is clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (mysterious stranger, coded messages). Some prose feels overly ornate, detracting from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but elements feel forced. The brief length works, but the narrative lacks lingering depth.</comment>
