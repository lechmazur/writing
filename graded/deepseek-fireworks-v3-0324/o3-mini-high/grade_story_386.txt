<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his identity as a time refugee, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness in the narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the character's resolve, but the climax (catapulting the tablecloth) feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and atmospheric, with the atom-powered lighthouse and "borrowed dawn" creating a hauntingly vivid setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, though some metaphors verge on over-ornamentation. The ending resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but occasional phrases ("unstoppable will," "timeless legacy") edge toward clich√©. The tablecloth as a relic is inspired.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the lighthouse and tablecloth serving the narrative elegantly. Leaves a lingering sense of melancholy hope.</comment>
