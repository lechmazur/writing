<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gentle brawler's duality of softness and strength is compelling, but his motivation to chronicle social changes feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders between vignettes, lacking a tight arc. The flat tire incident feels disconnected from the broader narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements feel loosely stitched together; the story's brevity highlights its lack of narrative cohesion rather than sharpening it.</comment>
