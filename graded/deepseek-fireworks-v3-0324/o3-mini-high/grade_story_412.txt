<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eliot's duality as a bookish assassin is compelling, but his geographically challenged trait feels underutilized in driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed; the cyclical nightmares and key cover deciphering could be more tightly woven into the resolution.</comment>
