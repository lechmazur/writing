<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's melancholy and ambition are vividly portrayed, but his "humorless comedic actor" trait feels underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders in a dreamlike way, which suits the tone but lacks clear cause-and-effect progression. The ending resolves softly but feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly immersive, with evocative sensory details and a setting that amplifies the character's isolation and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, though some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending lingers with quiet poignancy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its melancholy surrealism, but some phrases ("time’s unraveling tapestry") edge into purple prose. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive mood piece, though the story’s brevity limits thematic exploration. Leaves a wistful, reflective aftertaste.</comment>
