<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vega's digital nature and silent expressiveness are compelling, but his motivation to "dig deeper than memory allows" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric buildup; the integration of the barometer and seismograph feels inventive but slightly contrived in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world-building is lush and immersive, with the library and block parties creating a vivid contrast. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere, though the "drowsy enthusiasm" tone occasionally clashes with the urgency of Vega's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose stand out, but the emotional resonance is muted by the story's abstract focus. The ending is poetic but lacks definitive closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and a distinct voice, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés but risks sacrificing clarity for style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the story’s brevity leaves some thematic potential unexplored. Lingers more in mood than meaning.</comment>
