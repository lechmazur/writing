<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marvin's eccentricity and inner conflict are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to outmaneuver fate feels slightly abstract. His actions align well with his traits, though deeper nuance in his voice could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, but the tight word limit leaves some cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped. Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a striking, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details are immersive, and the setting enhances both character and theme, though the solar panels' hum could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, but the ending's wistfulness lacks punch. Literary devices are used deftly, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, but phrases like "bittersweet grit" recur excessively. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown. Avoids clich√©s but risks over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the thematic depth isn't fully mined. Creative combination of elements, but some feel underutilized.</comment>
