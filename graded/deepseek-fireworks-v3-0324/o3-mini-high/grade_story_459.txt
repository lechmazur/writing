<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elliot's character is vividly drawn with clear motivation, though his "elegantly clumsy" attribute could be more consistently integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly fragmented by repetitive motifs (ghost tours, flower crown). Pacing is effective, though the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle lab and ghostly atmosphere are richly evocative, but the setting's uniqueness occasionally overshadows the core concept of silence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but some literary devices verge on overworked. The ending is poignant but could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (ghosts as metaphors for grief). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the sand castle lab feels slightly gimmicky. The brevity serves the story well.</comment>
