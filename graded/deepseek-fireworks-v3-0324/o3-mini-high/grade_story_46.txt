<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer's motivation to learn the language of dreams is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. Her actions align with her role as guardian of rumors, but her 'voice' remains indistinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, but the connection between piano practice and the orchard's mysteries feels tenuous. Pacing is effective, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and waterfalls create a lush, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (ferns dancing, waterfalls whispering) are evocative and enhance the mood, though the piano practice feels slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary devices elevate the story, but the emotional resonance is muted by the performer's blankness. The ending is purposeful but lacks catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal premise, but some phrases verge on overly flowery. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite its dense elements, but the brevity limits deeper exploration. It leaves a lingering question but struggles to fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
