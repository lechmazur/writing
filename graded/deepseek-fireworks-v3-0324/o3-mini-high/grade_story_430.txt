<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his grotesque charm and generational sorrow, though his "closed-off" nature could be more actively demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically rich, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution of his defiance. Pacing is strong but could linger more on key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's surreal tone, though the "before the first lie" timeframe feels underutilized despite its poetic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent symbolism and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases verge on over-ornamentation. The handling of generational sorrow avoids clich√© but occasionally feels abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that lingers. The elements serve the story well, though the "nag" action feels slightly forced.</comment>
