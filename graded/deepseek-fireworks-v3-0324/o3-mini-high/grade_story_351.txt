<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's dreamy yet rebellious nature is well-established, but his motivation to "stand by the unremembered" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his traits, though deeper introspection could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric buildup. The "delicate undoing" concept drives the narrative, though the resolution feels rushed. Pacing is uneven due to dense prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the melancholic tone and Elias's quest, though the spectral figure's introduction could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, but some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending is poignant, though the theme of remembrance could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into florid phrasing ("wan moon," "ephemeral echoes"). Emotional resonance is strong, but some descriptors feel algorithmic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the word limit strains the exploration of Elias's transformation. The story lingers but risks sacrificing clarity for poetic density.</comment>
