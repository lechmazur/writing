<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's phobias and stunt double background create an intriguing contrast, but his motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his fears, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the connection between garage sales and the pyramid library feels disjointed. Pacing is uneven, with some rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with evocative sensory descriptions of the library and net. However, the garage sales disrupt the mood's consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (knots, net) is effective, and the ending is purposeful. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on vague spiritualism. Some phrases feel overly ornate ("mundanely spiritual"), and the garage sales clash tonally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the garage sales and net feel forced. The story lingers but lacks full cohesion.</comment>
