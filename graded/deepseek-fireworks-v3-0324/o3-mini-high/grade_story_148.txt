<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caleb's motivation is clear and consistent, with his storm-chasing past and carousel restoration deeply intertwined. His "eagerly unwilling" nature adds nuance, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from turmoil to triumph. However, the carousel's connection to the monastery feels slightly forced, and the tapestry subplot could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and desert contrasts are evocative, with strong sensory details (whispering winds, raindrops on cobblestones). The setting enhances Caleb's introspection and the carousel's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tongs, tapestry) and emotional resonance elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overworked ("luminous possibility").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its blend of storm-chasing and monastic life, but phrases like "nostalgic innovation" feel overly polished. Emotional depth is shown, not told, but some tropes linger.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the carousel and tongs serving the theme well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of renewal.</comment>
