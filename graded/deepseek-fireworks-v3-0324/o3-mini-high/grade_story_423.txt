<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's earnestness and burdened heart are clear, but his motivation to "spark flames in a land of ice" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his quest, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the astronomical map, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution. Pacing is effective, though the greenhouse tear-mapping method feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ruined aqueduct and desert setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (e.g., "glimmering stars," "scorching sands") immerse the reader, though the greenhouse connection is weaker.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism ("divine canvas of life") elevate the prose. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of rebirth could be more subtly woven. Emotional resonance is strong, though some metaphors verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the star-mapping premise, but phrases like "crisp nostalgia" risk clich√©. The knight's logic is nuanced, though the greenhouse tears feel contrived. Style avoids purple prose but occasionally overreaches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the map and desert setting serving the narrative well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection, though the greenhouse element slightly disrupts flow.</comment>
