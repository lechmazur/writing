<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear but his "bizarrely typical" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his sorrowful resolve, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the resolution via cloud tracking feels abrupt. Pacing is uneven—some moments linger while others rush.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The futuristic metropolis and rooftop stables create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (coffee aromas, sterile drones) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stamp, clouds) and subtext, but the ending's hopeful tone clashes slightly with the earlier melancholy. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original blending of futuristic and folkloric elements, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés but risks losing clarity in poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. Leaves a lingering question about legacy, though the execution isn't flawless.</comment>
