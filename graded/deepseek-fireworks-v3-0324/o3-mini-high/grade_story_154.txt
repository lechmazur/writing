<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier's motivation is clear but his "strongly weak" attribute feels inconsistently rendered, oscillating between exhaustion and sudden bursts of determination without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric vignettes; the levitating ink pot is a striking moment, yet the connection between "tracking urban legends" and the core conflict feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Celtic village setting is vividly atmospheric, though the "reimagined" aspect lacks specificity. Sensory details (whispering winds, glowing runes) excel, but the timeframe ("between games") muddies temporal grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink pot as talisman) and lyrical prose, but the theme of "jubilant despair" is stated more than earned. The ending’s hopeful echo feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but uneven in execution: "strands of courage" and "jubilant despair" verge on cliché, while the courier’s voice occasionally slips into generic weariness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements like the ink pot and levitation shine, but others (urban legends, games) feel tacked on. The brevity works for mood but sacrifices narrative depth.</comment>
