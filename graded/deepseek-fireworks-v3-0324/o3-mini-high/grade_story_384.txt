<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>John's motivation is clear and consistent, blending culinary passion with seismic curiosity, but his "frantic" nature feels slightly overplayed without deeper emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract connections (culinary/seismic) without fully resolving them, leaving the arc feeling incomplete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative, with sensory details (dust, vibrations) enhancing the eerie, decaying facility. The setting amplifies John's isolation and obsession.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors, symbolism) are used effectively, but the ending lacks punch. The theme of illusion vs. truth is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of culinary and seismic themes, though some phrases verge on purple prose. The premise avoids clich√©s but risks pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but stretched thin by its ambitious scope. The length suits the mood, but deeper thematic exploration is needed.</comment>
