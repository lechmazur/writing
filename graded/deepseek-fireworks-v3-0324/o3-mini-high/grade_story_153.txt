<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, with his immortality quest and scholarly detachment well-integrated. His actions align with his traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the digitization goal, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground setting and cosmic twilight timeframe merge evocatively. Sensory details (headlamp's beam, ancient murals) deepen atmosphere, though mole people could be more vividly realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (headlamp, journals) and thematic depth. The ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance could be sharper. Literary craft elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "gifted burdens" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of emotion and fresh metaphors (e.g., "mundanely glorious") stand out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels deliberate. Creative combination of immortality and digitization lingers, but mole people's role could be tighter.</comment>
