<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Caspar's jaded nature and motivation to preserve hunting methods are clear, but Maribel's fervor feels slightly underdeveloped. The gloves reveal his past, but his transformation lacks deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the gloves' mystery, though the pottery class encounter feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, but the spectral guardian's riddle resolution is rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and colonial rooftops create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (ceramic shards, twilight glow) immerse the reader, though the "delightfully menacing" energy could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (gloves, throne) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on ornate. Theme of legacy resonates, though subtext could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but "demure audacity" and "delightfully menacing" feel contrived. Some phrasing is overly flowery. Emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the throne's significance is vague. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic weight. Creative, but minor logic gaps remain.</comment>
