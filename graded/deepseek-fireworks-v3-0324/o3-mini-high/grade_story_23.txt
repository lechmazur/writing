<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his creative spirit is well-established, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the cosmic stakes feel underdeveloped within the word limit. Pacing is smooth but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere with vivid sensory details, though the setting's connection to the bard's quest could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices and thematic depth, but the ending's cosmic resolution feels abrupt. Strong "show, don't tell" execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the cosmic scale clashes slightly with the intimate tone. Leaves a lingering, if uneven, impression.</comment>
