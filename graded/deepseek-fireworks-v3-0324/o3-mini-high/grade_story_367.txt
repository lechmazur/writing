<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herbalist's paradoxical nature ("thoughtfully thoughtless") is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration. His motivation to study tides is clear, but his "fervent indifference" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot meanders between dreams and observations, lacking tight cause-and-effect. The ending resolves thematically but feels abrupt structurally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass-walled observatory and ocean cliff create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (rustling tomes, waning light) elevate the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (goose, bellows) and lyrical prose, but the theme of perfection's price is reiterated too explicitly, reducing subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose ("fervent indifference"). The herbalist's voice is distinctive but inconsistently nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive meditation on imperfection, though the word limit strains thematic depth. Leaves a lingering, if slightly overwrought, impression.</comment>
