<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlon's motivation is intriguing but somewhat obscured by the dense prose. His dual roles as dog walker and botanical custodian feel underdeveloped, though his resolve to "stand where fear dares not tread" adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is atmospheric but disjointed; the blood drive encounter feels tangential. The haunted mansion's connection to Marlon's botanical role is compelling but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mansion's eerie atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "loud silence" motif enhances tension, though the botanical collection's decay could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich in literary devices and subtext, but the ending lacks resolution. The theme of silent agreements is potent, though the blood drive detracts from its focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally verbose. The "carefully careless" paradox feels fresh, but some phrases verge on purple prose. Avoids clich√©s but risks over-complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce unevenly; the blood drive and mansion clash tonally. The prose is lush but sometimes sacrifices clarity for style. Leaves a haunting, if muddled, impression.</comment>
