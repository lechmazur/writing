<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vivid but slightly obscured by poetic abstraction; his "quiet mania" and fragmented self are compelling but could be more grounded in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over clear cause-and-effect; the plunge into memory feels abrupt yet thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich literary craft (symbolism, subtext) elevates the story, though some metaphors verge on overworked. Ending is haunting but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending surreal and nostalgic tones, though a few phrases ("coax thunder") edge toward cliché. Nuanced emotion saves it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the sport motif feels tacked on. Length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
