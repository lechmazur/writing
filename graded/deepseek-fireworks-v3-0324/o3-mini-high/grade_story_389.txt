<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The warlock's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "confusing certainty" feels slightly underdeveloped. His distinct voice and steely determination stand out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The connection between the warlock's actions and the lost artifacts is compelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the word limit slightly strains the depth. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery, suggesting deliberate brevity.</comment>
