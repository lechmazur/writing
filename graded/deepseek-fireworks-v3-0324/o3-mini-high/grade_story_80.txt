<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orion's "ingeniously clueless" nature is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his motivation is clear but his actions sometimes feel disjointed from his traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in places, with some logical gaps in Orion's investigative method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vividly rendered, but the connection to the doorknob and "quiet mania" tone could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism, though the ending's resolution feels slightly abrupt. The theme of obsession is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional over-reliance on atmospheric descriptors ("ephemeral echoes") risks purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story's brevity sometimes undermines cohesion. Leaves a lingering, if uneven, impression.</comment>
