<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The deputy's impassive nature and cautious bravery are clear, but his motivation to witness "pure grace" feels abstract and underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, but deeper introspection would strengthen his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The twist tie and oil changes are intriguing but don't fully drive the narrative. Pacing is deliberate, though the ending feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with lush sensory details that elevate the mystical tone. The abandoned cathedral and orchard create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that complements the deputy's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose enhance the story's impact, though some metaphors verge on overwrought. The theme of renewal amid decay is poignant, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal setting and twist tie motif, but the "secret language of bees" feels contrived. Some phrasing is overly ornate, risking purple prose. The tone is consistent but occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, though a few (like bees) feel forced. The brevity works, leaving a lingering mood, but the narrative could benefit from sharper thematic focus.</comment>
