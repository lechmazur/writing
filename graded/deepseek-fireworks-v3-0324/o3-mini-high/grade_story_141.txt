<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus's superstitious nature and strange methods are well-integrated, but his motivation to transcend the physical realm feels slightly abstract. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the scavenger hunt encounter feels abrupt. The ending ties back thematically, but the middle could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater cave setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "curious dread" is immersive. Sensory details (echoes, drips) enhance the mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (notebook, myths) and subtext, but the epiphany feels slightly rushed. The theme of women's wisdom is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "space between thunder and lightning" motif edges toward overused. Nuanced emotion and fresh metaphors elevate it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length, with a lingering thematic resonance. The elements serve the story, but some transitions feel forced.</comment>
