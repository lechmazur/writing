<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's paradoxical attachment to the broken chopstick and his resolve to empower others through culinary rituals are compelling, though his "hatefully adored" intensity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The cookbook method feels underdeveloped as a driving force.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submarine facility's eerie atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (fluorescent buzz, creaking steps) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the theme of chaos and order.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (broken chopstick, relics) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though the central conflict—reconciling chaos and order—could be sharper. The ending resonates but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases verge on overly ornate ("hatefully adored intensity"). The fusion of culinary and spiritual motifs feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, but the cookbook and submarine facility connection strains logic. The brevity works, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
