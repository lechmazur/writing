<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "almost radical" determination feels consistent but lacks deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on metaphysical abstraction, making cause-and-effect relationships feel tenuous. Pacing is dense for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen is vividly rendered with potent sensory details, though the "abrasive calm" tone occasionally clashes with the setting's intensity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, but the ending's resolution feels overly reliant on cosmic abstraction rather than character agency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose. Some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic silence") verge on clich√© despite evocative phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story's density sacrifices emotional immediacy. The length feels deliberate but taxing.</comment>
