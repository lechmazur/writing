<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "spontaneously cautious" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though some transitions feel abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The coral reef city and bioluminescent imagery are particularly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes emotion. The theme of revolution is compelling, though the ending leans slightly toward exposition over subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
