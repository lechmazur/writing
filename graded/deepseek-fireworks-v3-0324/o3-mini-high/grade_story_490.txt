<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is vividly clear, blending obsession with the forbidden and a paradoxical mix of dedication and apathy. His actions and voice are distinct, though his "methodically random" attribute could be more consistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The caretaker's quest drives the narrative well, though the visitors' arrival feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are richly evoked, with sensory details (lavender, rusted beams) enhancing the mood. The repair station and deserted shore harmonize beautifully with the tone of forbidden allure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "newborn galaxy") elevate the prose, and the theme of forbidden knowledge resonates. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the caretaker's obsession and the juxtaposition of "enthusiastic apathy." Some phrases verge on overly ornate, but the voice avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It lingers in the mind, though the pacing could be smoother.</comment>
