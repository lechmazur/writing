<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mad botanist's motivation is clear and consistent, blending scientific rigor with mystical curiosity, though his "comically serious" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the film reel's discovery, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The high-altitude tea house setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (mist, lanterns, snapping plants) enhancing the eerie mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the belt, ionized energies) deepen the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "fickle loyalty" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on overly ornate ("spectral breezes intertwined"). The botanist's voice avoids clich√© but occasionally feels strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "intermission" timeframe feels underutilized. The story lingers with thematic depth but could refine its stylistic balance.</comment>
