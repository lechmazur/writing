<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aldric's death wish and poison-taster background are compelling but could be more deeply explored. His motivation to map energy flows is clear but slightly overshadowed by the dense prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed in places. The connection between the ice sculpture's collapse and Aldric's fate is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and hidden societies create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are rich, though the ice sculpture's inclusion feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, energy flows) and evocative prose. The ending is impactful but could benefit from more emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into overly ornate language. Some tropes (hidden societies, death wish) are handled well but not subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite its complexity. Elements serve the narrative, though the tight word limit slightly hampers full exploration.</comment>
