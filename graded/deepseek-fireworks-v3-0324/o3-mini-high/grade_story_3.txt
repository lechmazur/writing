<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation and personality are vividly portrayed, though his "serenely frantic" nature could be more consistently demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meandering; the cosmic riddle motif is compelling but could drive the narrative more forcefully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sailor's graveyard setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details that immerse the reader, though the "between seasons" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though the word limit slightly hampers thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering, if abstract, impression.</comment>
