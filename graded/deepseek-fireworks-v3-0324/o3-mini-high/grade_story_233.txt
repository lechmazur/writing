<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Terrin's naivety and longing are clear, but his motivation to "hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate" feels underdeveloped and overly poetic for his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The plot has a mystical arc but feels disjointed, especially with the abrupt inclusion of "between commercials." The pacing is uneven, rushing through key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vault's atmosphere is richly detailed, but the "peculiarly virtual" energy of the statue clashes with the ancient, tactile setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are present but heavy-handed. The ending is poignant but undermined by earlier inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into flowery prose ("seeds of understanding," "whispered promise"). Some phrases feel AI-generated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The elements don't fully cohere; the story struggles to balance mysticism with its modern touches ("between commercials").</comment>
