<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his past, though his "uncertainly certain" determination could be more vividly shown through action rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a coherent arc, but the echo test method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is strong, though the ritual's execution lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly detailed, with the castle ruin library and rosebud serving as potent symbols. Sensory details elevate the mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional purple prose and predictable tropes (spectral guardian, forgotten legacy). Emotional nuance is present but inconsistently shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the echo test feels forced. The story lingers with thematic weight, but some logic gaps remain.</comment>
