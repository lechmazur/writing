<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The statue's motivation is clear and consistent, blending melancholy and hope, but its telepathic abilities feel underutilized in driving deeper character exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the "weatherize" action is inventive but could be more tightly woven into the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the "gloomy cheerfulness" tone occasionally clashes with the world's mechanical grit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, but the ending lacks a definitive emotional punch despite its thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. The statue's voice and the hair tie's symbolism feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story's brevity slightly undermines its thematic weight. A lingering, unresolved tension works in its favor.</comment>
