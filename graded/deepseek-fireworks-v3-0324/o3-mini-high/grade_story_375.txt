<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The saboteur's dual nature is compelling, but his motivation to "channel the wrath of a star" feels abstract and underdeveloped. His actions align with his defiance, but deeper introspection is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surreal elements (mannequins, star-wrath) without clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is uneven, with dense exposition early on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with decay and hope intertwined. Sensory details (broken antennas, creaking walkways) immerse the reader, though the gorge's role is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flashlight, mannequins) and subtext (imperfection as revolution). The ending is purposeful, but some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose ("fierce, yet placid anger"). Avoids clichés but struggles with tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lingering thought—imperfection as revolution—is potent but not fully explored.</comment>
