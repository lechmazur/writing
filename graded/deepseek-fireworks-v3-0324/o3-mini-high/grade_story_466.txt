<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The character's morally ambiguous nature and motivation to decode the forgotten are clear, but his "cunning connoisseur" persona feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from mundane shopping to mystical discovery. The connection between the beginning and end is strong, though the transition to the tower feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (autumn leaves, crumbling stone) enhancing the mood. The smoke signal tower and vintage seed packets are meaningfully connected, creating a haunting, immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story effectively uses literary devices (symbolism, imagery) and has a memorable, layered narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of "decoding the forgotten" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but some phrases feel overly ornate ("gentle chaos," "fervent bid"). Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though the brevity slightly limits thematic exploration.</comment>
