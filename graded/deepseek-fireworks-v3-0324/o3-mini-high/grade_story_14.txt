<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eddie's naive gambler persona is well-defined, but his motivation to "capture one last spark before oblivion" feels slightly abstract. His actions align with his reckless hope, though deeper introspection could strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently, with Eddie's journey twisting unpredictably. The tight word limit is managed well, though some transitions between scenes (e.g., lectures to harbor) feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal station's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (creaking shadows, murmuring tides) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the story's enigmatic energy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., candle mold as fate's symbol) are effective, and the ending resonates. However, the theme of "unspoken bargains" could be more explicitly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in Eddie's arc, but some phrases ("laughing tears") verge on clich√©. The prose avoids purple tendencies but occasionally leans into predictable gambler tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it. The brevity works, though deeper thematic exploration would elevate it further.</comment>
