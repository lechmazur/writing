<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence and a sense of arc, but the pond-ring method feels tangential to the core conflict of faith and brewing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The secret dog park setting is evocative and enhances the alchemist's isolation, though the "during brewing" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext elevate the story, but some metaphors verge on overworked (e.g., the pond rings). The ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into florid prose. The golden typewriter ribbon is a standout, but "exultant grief" feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the dog park setting and pond method slightly distract from the central theme.</comment>
