<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mage's "lukewarm" and "loyally peculiar" traits are intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the tight word limit forces abrupt transitions; the "clash" action drives momentum but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”vivid lunar base and spectral fog create haunting immersion, though the doormat's lore feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism elevate the prose, but the ending's "poignant calm" verges on overwrought; theme of renewal is compelling but heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ephemeral silhouettes") and predictable tropes (haunted past, spectral echoes). Some freshness in tone, but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the lunar base feels underutilized; the story's brevity works, though some themes beg expansion.</comment>
