<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desert wanderer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness. His actions align well with his research-driven resolve, though deeper emotional nuance would elevate his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within the word limit, but the connection between the orchard's apple and the pirate ship feels tenuous. Pacing is well-managed, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The space pirate ship and stardust tapestry are vividly rendered, though the orchard's relevance to the setting is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used effectively, and the theme of translated love adds depth. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but phrases like "translated love" verge on overused. The prose occasionally feels ornate without payoff. Emotional resonance is present but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite its density. Elements serve the narrative well, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering sense of cosmic wonder.</comment>
