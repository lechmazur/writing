<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his abandoned identity, but his "professional scapegoat" role feels underdeveloped and slightly incongruent with his introspective journey.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the cryptic phone calls and sacred symbols could be more tightly woven into the action to avoid feeling like detached devices.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cloud City's atmosphere is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the "library card" timeframe feels tangential rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's hopeful resolution slightly undermines the earlier tension and mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("forgotten dreams," "whispered secrets"). The metal washer is a standout fresh detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, though some elements (scapegoat role, library card) feel less essential to the core narrative.</comment>
