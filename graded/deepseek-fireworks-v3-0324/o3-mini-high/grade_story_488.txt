<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "fierce ambition" and nostalgia are compelling but could be more grounded in tangible actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a dreamlike coherence, but the connection between the quantum beach and the condemned building feels tenuous. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The quantum beach and corroded rapture create a vivid, surreal atmosphere, but the setting's rules are unclear. Sensory details (damp sand, sea glass) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "hymn to the convergence") are lush but occasionally overwrought. The ending is poetic but lacks concrete emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases ("corroded rapture," "quantum mysteries") verge on pretentious. The family holiday element feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans heavily on abstraction. Elements like the map and holiday celebration don't fully integrate into the core theme.</comment>
