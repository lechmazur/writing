<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Remy's motivation is clear and consistent, but his telepathy feels underutilized. His "efficiently inefficient" trait is well-integrated, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meandering. The connection between decoding journals and glacier patterns feels forced. Pacing is uneven due to dense prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, but the "cusp of seasons" timeframe isn't fully exploited. Atmosphere enhances the story's mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich literary devices and subtext elevate the story, but the ending lacks punch. The theme of redefining success is compelling but occasionally overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though some phrases verge on purple prose. The vintage button hook and noble foolishness lend authenticity, but the telepathy feels gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. The style is lush but sometimes obscures clarity. Leaves a lingering impression, though the word limit strains the narrative.</comment>
