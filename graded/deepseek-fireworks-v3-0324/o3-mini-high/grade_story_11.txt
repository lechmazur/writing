<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's flighty yet determined nature is well-conveyed, but his "strangely normal" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but occasionally overshadowed by dense prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but overly reliant on abstract musings. The action ("linearize") drives the narrative, but pacing suffers from excessive introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The initiation hall's atmosphere is richly detailed, with sensory immersion. The grease-stained patch ties elegantly to the setting, though the "flicker of unity" mural feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the prose veers into purple territory. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrasing ("serene anger," "linearize the chaotic"). Some metaphors feel fresh, others clich√©d. Nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The lingering thought is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
