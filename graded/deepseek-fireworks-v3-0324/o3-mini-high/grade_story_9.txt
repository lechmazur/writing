<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The soothsayer's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "mild panic" feels underdeveloped. His sarcasm and bitter prophecy add depth, but his actions could better reflect his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the puzzle box's role feels unresolved. Pacing is strong, though the environmental stewardship theme occasionally disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The neon-lit desert and billboard maze are vividly rendered, creating a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (light, dust, flickering signs) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the puzzle box's significance feels slightly forced. The brevity works in its favor, leaving a lingering unease.</comment>
