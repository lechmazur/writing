<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vigilante's motivation is intriguing but slightly inconsistent; the antique dentist's drill as a talisman is unique, but his "lazily ambitious" nature feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the vigilante's methods, though the barbershop quartet gossip feels contrived. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The "city of forgotten fountains" is a standout, but the timeframe ("pause between raindrops") is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes thought, but the ending lacks deeper thematic resonance. The writing style is ornate but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases verge on purple prose. The dentist's drill and whimsy feel fresh, though the barbershop quartet method is gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the length feels restrictive for the ambitious concept. Leaves a lingering impression, though not fully realized.</comment>
