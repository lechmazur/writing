<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grandmaster's chess background and motivation to find hidden passages are clear, but his "delightfully dull" exterior feels underdeveloped and inconsistently portrayed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the xenophobic conflict feels abrupt, and the hydroponic farm's role in the resolution is unclear.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hydroponic noodle farm is vividly surreal, and the atmosphere of "agonizing bliss" is immersive, though some sensory details are overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (puzzle piece, chess) and evocative prose, but the ending's thematic payoff is somewhat vague.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, though some phrases ("swirl of dusk-lit confetti") verge on purple prose. Emotional nuance is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story occasionally feels strained by its constraints. Leaves a lingering, if slightly muddled, impression.</comment>
