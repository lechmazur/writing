<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The apprentice's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of their "uniquely literal" attribute. Their actions align with their goal, but their personality feels somewhat flat.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, but the connection between the phone booth key and star maps feels tenuous. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong atmospheric details, but the "haunted" aspect is underutilized. The war-for-water backdrop is intriguing but not fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are used well, and the story evokes a sense of mystery. However, the theme of "grand designs" feels overstated, and the ending lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some clich√©d phrasing ("bright-eyed," "whispered secrets"). The prose occasionally veers into purple territory, though the concept is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by its elements. The length suits the narrative, but some ideas (e.g., the phone booth key) aren't fully explored.</comment>
