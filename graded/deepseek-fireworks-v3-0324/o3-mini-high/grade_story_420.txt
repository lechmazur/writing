<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "excited boredom" feels slightly underdeveloped as a defining trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the ring and dinosaur bones feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, though the dinosaur bones and bark texture feel underutilized. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>
