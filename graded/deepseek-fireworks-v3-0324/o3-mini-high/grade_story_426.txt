<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The character's "angrily peaceful" spirit and motivation to preserve folk medicines are compelling, but his "secretive pathfinder" trait feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over clear cause-and-effect progression. The marathon training feels secondary to the ghost train's mystique.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, nostalgic atmosphere. The cracked teapot ties elegantly to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teapot, playlists) and subtext, though the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. The theme of blending old and new is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "hacking playlists" method is inventive, though the "angrily peaceful" dichotomy could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the marathon training feels underutilized. The story lingers emotionally but lacks narrative punch.</comment>
