<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The juggler's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "frenzied" nature could be more vividly shown through actions rather than described.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract imagery, which slightly obscures cause-and-effect logic. The arc feels complete but rushed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The void and abandoned summer create a haunting atmosphere, though the "yawning void" risks cliché. Sensory details (tea leaves, murals) are evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical prose elevate the story, but some metaphors verge on overworked. The ending resonates, though the theme of "cultural bridges" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose. The juggler's voice is distinct, but the euphoria tone feels inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the void/love letter pairing feels slightly forced. The brevity serves the story’s dreamlike quality well.</comment>
