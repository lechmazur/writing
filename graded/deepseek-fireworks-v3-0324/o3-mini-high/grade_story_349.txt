<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aeron's cynically hopeful nature is clear and drives his actions, but his backstory as a drone pilot feels underdeveloped in relation to his medieval setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the speed-dating event feels jarring and disrupts the medieval fantasy tone. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory and twilight setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (herb bundle, horizons of mercy), but some metaphors verge on purple prose. Ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrasing feels overly ornate or AI-like. Emotional depth is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements naturally. Leaves a lingering thought, though not deeply resonant.</comment>
