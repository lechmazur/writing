<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gideon's curiosity and morbid fascination are well-developed, driving his actions consistently. His "loudly serene" tone adds depth, though his mortician background could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly meandering. The bracelet and journals tie together, but the vanishing footprints feel underutilized as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (twilight glow, rustling leaves) enhance the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) and thematic depth ("polite anarchy," cyclical life/death) elevate the prose. The ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "rustle of revelation" borders on overused. The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans into ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts (vanishing footprints) could be sharper.</comment>
