<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear but his "analytically playful" attribute feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has coherence but feels rushed. The connection between the orchard and futuristic hub is tenuous, and pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, blending futuristic and ancient elements well. Sensory details enhance immersion, though the setting's duality occasionally clashes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the emotional impact is uneven. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (cursed orchard, relic quest). Some prose feels overly ornate, though the fusion of futuristic and ancient is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but constrained by its elements. Creative thinking is evident, but the length limits depth and lingering impact.</comment>
