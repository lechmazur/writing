<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat abstract; his "inner compulsion" and "reckoning" feel poetic but lack concrete grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but meandering; the cosmic and personal threads intertwine elegantly, though the resolution feels overly ethereal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality wavers between striking (the coathanger) and clichéd ("branches of redemption"); prose sometimes slips into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but overly ambitious for its length; elements serve the theme well, though depth is sacrificed for lyricism.</comment>
