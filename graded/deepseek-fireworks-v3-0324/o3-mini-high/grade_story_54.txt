<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Malcolm's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "even-tempered" nature feels underdeveloped compared to his rebellious actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed; the connection between the offload and preserving hunting techniques could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe (unsent letter) feels slightly detached.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices and atmosphere, but the ending lacks a definitive punch. The theme of defiance is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (lonely smuggler, starlit guidance). The prose occasionally veers into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the word limit constraints show in rushed transitions. Leaves a lingering thought but not a lasting impact.</comment>
