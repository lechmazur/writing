<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'brainy observer' trait feels underdeveloped. The porcelain doll adds depth, but his scholarly side lacks exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels slightly rushed. The connection between street art and lost civilizations could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered, but the futuristic setting isn't fully integrated with ancient mysteries. Sensory details are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though some metaphors verge on overworked. Ending is purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into purple prose. Some tropes (lost civilizations, fragile strength) are handled predictably.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. Lingering thought is present but not fully resonant.</comment>
