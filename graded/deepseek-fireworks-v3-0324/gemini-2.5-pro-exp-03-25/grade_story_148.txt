<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's storm-chaser background and desert solitude contrast effectively with his alpine setting, revealing depth through his struggle with patience versus brute force. His motivation to restore the carousel is clear but could benefit from more explicit emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is coherent, with the tapestry decoding serving as a clever pivot, though the carousel’s restoration arc feels slightly rushed. Pacing balances introspection and action well within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alpine monastery and abandoned carousel create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., the tongs’ "cold weight") are precise and immersive, though more alpine-specific textures could deepen the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the tapestry as metaphor for focus) are strong, and the theme of resilience resonates. The ending is satisfying but could linger more on the carousel’s symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the carousel’s juxtaposition with monastic austerity. Nuanced emotions ("eagerly unwilling") avoid cliché, though some phrases verge on over-poetic ("weaving his own fragmented focus").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the carousel and tapestry enriching each other. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on creation and patience.</comment>
