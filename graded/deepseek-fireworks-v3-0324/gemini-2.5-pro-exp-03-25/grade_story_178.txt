<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving the narrative with emotional weight. His exhaustion and desperation are palpable, though his "overburdened clerk" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from crisis to interdimensional leap. The trivia-night encounter is a weak link, but the stakes and resolution are compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse and alien world are vividly rendered, with sensory details that immerse the reader. The "dissonant calm" tone is masterfully sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stamps as anchors, bioluminescence as disease) and layered themes (relativity, sacrifice) elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly open yet satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and inventive, avoiding clich√©s. The quantum-mechanical twist on interdimensional travel feels fresh, though the trivia-night setup leans slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for resonance without sacrificing depth.</comment>
