<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rex's motivations are clear and consistent, but Elara's backstory feels slightly underdeveloped. His paranoia and actions align well with his stranded, desperate state.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the sabotage's execution could feel more consequential. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The island's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (bioluminescent moss, insect symphony) enhancing the oppressive mood. The setting feels integral to the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (crystal ball, typewriter) and subtext (knowledge as both salvation and weapon). The ending is haunting but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "bitter honey" risks leaning into clich√©. Rex's delirium and Elara's ambiguity feel authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, layered narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
