<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's faintheartedness and desperate motivation are clear and consistent, driving his actions and use of the ruler. His paradoxical role as a guardian seeking forbidden knowledge adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with Kael's clandestine ritual driving the narrative. The tight word limit is managed effectively, though the ending could feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oppressive atmosphere of the chamber contrasts brilliantly with the mundane sounds outside, enhancing tension. Sensory details (creaks, barking) immerse the reader.</comment>
