<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby's grumpy yet reluctantly heroic demeanor is well-developed and consistent, with clear motivation rooted in his disdain for his accidental role. His transformation feels earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the overheard conversation and beetle's metamorphosis driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The swamp orchard and dawn setting are vividly rendered, with sensory details (oily sludge, skeletal branches) enhancing the atmosphere. Monks and carnival contrast effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (beetle as stagnation/change), evocative prose, and a resonant ending elevate this beyond surface plot. Theme of fate vs. agency is subtly powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "skeletal branches of the polluted swamp orchard") and nuanced emotional beats avoid clich√©. The premise feels wholly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Every element serves the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
