<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's phobias and motivations are vividly portrayed, driving his actions with a clear, perverse logic. His voice is distinct, though his internal monologue could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from monotony to confrontation. Pacing is excellent, though the garage sale intro feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pyramid's oppressive atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details amplifying Leo's claustrophobia. The net's mundanity contrasts brilliantly with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the net as inner knots) and a hauntingly quiet resolution elevate this beyond mere adventure. The ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, avoiding clich√©s. The net's purpose is refreshingly ambiguous, though some phrases verge on over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where every element serves the theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
