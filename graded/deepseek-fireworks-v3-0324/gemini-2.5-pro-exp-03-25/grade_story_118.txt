<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's hive-mind nature and therapeutic role are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct, eerie voice. Thorne's jitters are effectively externalized, revealing depth in both characters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by 734's action, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect is logical, but the ending feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile facility and eerie atmosphere are richly detailed, with sensory elements (beeswax, ozone) enhancing the mood. The setting amplifies the story's tension and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (wax, charger plug) and subtext. The ending lingers, and the prose is polished, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, though the hive-mind concept risks feeling slightly gimmicky without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story elegantly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
