<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "nomadic dreamer" trait feels underutilized beyond initial setup. Her "ferociously polite" demeanor is well-executed but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The intervention is logical, but the coin toss's significance fades quickly, leaving the opening feeling slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances the conflict. The mariner’s wheel’s incongruity is a standout detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (wheel, blooms) and subtext (masked intentions). The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally. Dialogue is sharp but sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though some phrases verge on formulaic ("cloying sweetness"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, but lacks deeper layers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the nomadic dreamer and coin toss feel slightly tacked on. The length suits the story, leaving a subtle but not lingering impact.</comment>
