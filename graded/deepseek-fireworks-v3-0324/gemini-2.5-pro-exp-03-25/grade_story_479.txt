<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seraphina's motivation is clear and consistent, blending ancient practices with modern digital preservation. Her "fruitlessly patient" attribute adds depth, though her glamorous undertaker role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual of paint mixing and digital measurement driving the narrative. Pacing is excellent, and the ending resonates with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opulent workshop and social network archive create a striking contrast. Sensory details (turpentine, brass tape) immerse the reader, enhancing the melancholic yet defiant atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (paint as memory, brass tape as measurement of digital echoes) elevates the story. The ending is poignant, and the theme of defiance against oblivion is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The blend of archaic ritual and digital decay avoids clich√©s, though "glamorous undertaker" borders on gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and impermanence.</comment>
