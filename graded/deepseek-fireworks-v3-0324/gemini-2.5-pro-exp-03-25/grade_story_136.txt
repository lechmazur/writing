<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her actions, though her "quiet matchmaker" role could be more explicitly tied to her cosmic revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Elara's risky rewiring driving the narrative toward a resonant climax. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>
