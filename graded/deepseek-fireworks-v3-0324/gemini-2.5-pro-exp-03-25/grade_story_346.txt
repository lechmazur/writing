<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's boastful warrior persona is well-integrated, but his shift to cold calculation feels abrupt. The lint-filled pocket grounds him effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The "rewire" action drives the climax well, though the balloon pops distract from the core tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasp nest setting is vividly immersive, and the tone of "precise madness" enhances the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (confetti, buzzing) are standout strengths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., "honeyed falsehoods"), but the ending lacks full emotional payoff. The theme of fabricated reality is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The "intimately impersonal" snippets and discordant humming are fresh, though the warrior trope leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. The brevity works, but the balloon pops feel underutilized. Leaves a lingering unease.</comment>
