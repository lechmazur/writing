<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's reincarnation and guilt are compelling, but his "tentatively fierce" energy feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically assured, but the word limit truncates deeper exploration of Finn's guilt.</comment>
