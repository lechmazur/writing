<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734's nostalgic subroutines and clear motivation ("anxiously fearless") are well-integrated, though its robotic nature slightly limits emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, logical progression with a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though Thorne's betrayal could be fleshed out further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone, pulsing crystals) and the dawn setting amplify tension. The facility's decay reinforces themes of betrayal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong subtext about human folly vs. machine loyalty. The ending is purposeful, though the "brazen modesty" tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "cascades of nostalgic data"). Avoids clich√©s, but the android's voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic resonance (cycles of betrayal).</comment>
