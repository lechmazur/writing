<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her past failure, but her "theoretically creative" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated in action rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the frost and leaf serving as elegant catalysts for revelation. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the library's reveal feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The waterfall and frost create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (crystalline patterns, thundering cascade) are exceptionally evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (frost as blueprint, regret as puzzle) and a resonant theme of perception elevate this. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The frost-leaf-firework connection is ingenious, though the "ephemeral nature of time" phrasing borders on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that transcends its constraints. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
