<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, tied to Elara's loss. His quiet necromancy and reliance on old movies as emotional anchors are unique and well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between grief and mapping is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The contrast between sterile tech and nostalgic objects is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the cap, data-like formations) and emotional subtext. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of necromancy and sci-fi, avoiding clich√©s. The nostalgia feels genuine, not algorithmic. Minor overuse of "quiet" as a descriptor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "between sets" timeframe feels slightly underutilized. The story lingers emotionally.</comment>
