<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's serene demeanor contrasts effectively with his obsessive quest, revealing depth through subtle actions like the wristband snagging. Motivation is clear but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action. The quilt unraveling drives the narrative, though the resolution feels more thematic than concrete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—damp earth, phantom blossoms, and extinct plants create a haunting, immersive world that elevates the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (quilt as obfuscated knowledge), but the ending’s ambiguity slightly undermines impact. Literary craft is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clichés. The wristband and quilt are fresh metaphors, though the "art of illusion" theme feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about the value of the search itself.</comment>
