<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's dual identity as a street performer with a dangerous past is compelling, and his motivation to reconcile with an adversary is clear. However, his creative block feels underdeveloped in relation to his broader conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coral reef triggering the memory sequence effectively. Pacing is strong, though the resolution of "between calls" could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is vividly rendered with sensory details (machine oil, spiced rum), and the bio-luminescent coral adds a striking contrast. Atmosphere deeply supports Silas's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of tactile imagery and symbolism (gauntlet as burden/key). Emotional resonance is high, though the theme of atonement could be more explicitly woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The coral reef as a memory trigger is inventive, and Silas's internal conflict feels nuanced. Minor over-reliance on "coded desperation" as a descriptor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about Silas's past and future.</comment>
