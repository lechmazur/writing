<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic and effective pacing. The moon path method and guardian confrontation drive the narrative cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (silver sap, phosphorescent fungi) enhance the eerie, dreamlike tone.</comment>
