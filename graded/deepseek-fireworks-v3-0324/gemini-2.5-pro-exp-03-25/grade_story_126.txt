<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is sharp and clear, but his merchant background feels underutilized beyond technical skills. The butter churn reveals his connection to authenticity, but his "aloof passion" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical escalation from observation to rebellion. The ascent via the poster is inventive, though the station's security feels conveniently lax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sterile, post-arboreal setting is vividly rendered, with the butter churn's tactile presence contrasting brilliantly against the synthetic world. Sensory details (ozone, dust) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (churn as relic, poster as crumbling past) and subtext (humanity's soul traded for survival). The ending is purposeful, though the broadcast's immediate impact is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The butter churn as a rebellion tool is fresh, though "aloof passion" edges toward abstraction. Language is precise without being purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on authenticity and illusion.</comment>
