<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, with his subdued vigilante nature and pursuit of the Silent Step art well-integrated. His actions and dialogue reveal depth, though his "artfully clumsy" attribute could be more subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Kaelen's dual focus on flattery and mirror-tracking, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is tight yet effective for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" tone are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The funhouse mirror is a standout, deeply connected to the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bead, mirror) and subtext (war's cost). The ending is purposeful, though the theme could resonate more deeply with sharper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors ("ghosts of hurried departures"). The subdued vigilante trope is handled uniquely, though some phrasing leans slightly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering tension, though the ancient art's stakes could be clearer.</comment>
