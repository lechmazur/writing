<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby's docile bruiser persona and disturbingly calm demeanor are well-integrated, but his motivation to "mold a myth" feels slightly abstract for such a grounded character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect, though the language barrier subplot fades too quickly after setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered, with sensory details (humidity, drum solos) amplifying tension. The baton's phosphorescent glow ties elegantly to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext (myth vs. reality), but the ending’s thematic punch could be sharper. The "brash tenderness" tone is distinctive but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "maddening rhythm section for rustling foliage"), though the "docile bruiser" archetype edges toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce impressively, but the myth-making motive needs deeper grounding. The word limit feels purposeful, not restrictive.</comment>
