<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jedediah's motivation is clear and consistent, blending outlaw defiance with poetic curiosity. His actions align well with his desire to disrupt predictability, though his "saturated ambivalence" could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the misalignment action driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the phantom coffee shop mechanic feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive, with vivid steampunk details and atmospheric tension. The observatory setting enhances the thematic clash between order and chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the humming runes, heat-haze text) are effective. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of curiosity vs. chaos could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the cowboy-poet-steampunk fusion. Some phrases verge on ornate ("saturated ambivalence"), but the voice remains distinct and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, with the length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, though the coffee shop projection slightly disrupts tonal consistency.</comment>
