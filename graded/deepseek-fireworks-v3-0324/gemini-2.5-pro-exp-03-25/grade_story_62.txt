<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's wannabe philosopher persona and sewer-dwelling background are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "rewrite existence" feels slightly abstract. His voice is distinct, though his internal deceit could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Alistair's monologue, but the transition from sewer to orchard feels abrupt. The ending mirrors his fading hope effectively, though the middle lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard amphitheater and "bruised twilight" create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (decay, phantom blossoms) are evocative, but the sewer's contrast isn't fully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary devices (leaky cup as symbolism) and subtext, but the "mismatched sock" metaphor, while clever, risks trivializing the existential theme. The ending lingers poignantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh in its absurdist take on mundanity, though the "candid deceit" tone occasionally wavers. No clich√©s, but the "cosmic laundry" idea borders on gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically deliberate, with creative use of elements. The brevity works, but the orchard setting feels slightly underdeveloped compared to the sewer.</comment>
