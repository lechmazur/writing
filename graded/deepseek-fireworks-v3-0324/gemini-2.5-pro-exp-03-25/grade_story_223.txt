<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's seasickness and naval background are well-integrated into his character, but his "awkwardly charming" attribute feels underdeveloped. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the moon-phase method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is effective, though the transformation sequence could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon are vividly rendered, creating a strong atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, though the "quiet longing of centuries" could be more tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the theme of self-confrontation is compelling. The ending is satisfying, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors. However, the "nostalgic defiance" tone isn't fully realized, and some phrasing leans toward ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements. The brief length works, but a few elements (e.g., moon phases) feel slightly forced.</comment>
