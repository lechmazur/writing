<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with her solitary nature and artistic sensitivity shaping her actions. Her "fiercely gentle" demeanor is subtly but effectively conveyed through her protective grip on the notepad.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the notepad's confessions driving Elara's decision to reconnect. The leap of faith is foreshadowed and resolved with satisfying coherence, despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered, its bioluminescence and cosmic backdrop enhancing the story's themes of isolation and possibility. Sensory details (recycled air, alien pollen) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (the garden as a canvas, the notepad as a bridge to courage). The ending resonates emotionally, and the prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The hushed confessions and cosmic setting feel fresh, and Elara's nuanced emotions are shown, not told. No AI-generated tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, polished work where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of hope and vulnerability.</comment>
