<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barnaby's dual nature (kindly guard vs. aspirational escapee) is compelling, but his "loyal disloyalty" could be more sharply defined to avoid ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot's arc is clear but slightly rushed; the spoon's ritual could be more integrated earlier to strengthen coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—the cafe's surreal hush and "frothy despair" are vividly rendered, though the grocery store comparison feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and subtext (e.g., spoon as compass), but the ending's "thinning hush" could resonate more deeply with earlier motifs.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "soft edges of time" metaphor risks overuse. Avoids clichés but could push further into strangeness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but some elements (e.g., typewriter rhythm) feel underdeveloped for their thematic weight.</comment>
