<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's social awkwardness and motivation are clear, but his "inventor" aspect feels underdeveloped. His use of the whistle is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The reversed trails method is creative but could be more seamlessly integrated into the action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the tight word limit slightly hampers deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
