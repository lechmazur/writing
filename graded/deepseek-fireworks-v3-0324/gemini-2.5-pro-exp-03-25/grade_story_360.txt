<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's meekness and sincere curiosity are vividly portrayed, aligning perfectly with her unconventional necromancy. Her motivation to understand rather than dominate death is clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the broken pen and dew drop serving as effective catalysts for Elara's epiphany. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (phosphorescent fungi, echoing laughter) enhancing the mystic tone. Setting and concept merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (light refraction as metaphor for understanding) and subtext. The ending is profound yet understated, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. The dew-drop revelation feels fresh, and Elara's nuanced introspection avoids AI sterility. Language is vivid but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply thoughtful vignette. Elements serve the story organically, and the brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive. Lingers in the mind.</comment>
