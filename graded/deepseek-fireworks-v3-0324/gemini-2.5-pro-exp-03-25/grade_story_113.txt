<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's hesitance and 'shyly loud' attribute are well-integrated, revealing depth through her internal conflict and subtle actions. Her motivation is clear but could be more explicitly tied to her personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the dream-hopping mechanic feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit, but the resolution could be more definitive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and dreamscape are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, melancholic atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (dinosaur plush, temporal shards) and lyrical prose. The ending is poignant but slightly ambiguous. Theme of carrying grief is resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors ("temporal seam stitched poorly shut"). Avoids clich√©s, though the dream-hopping trope risks familiarity. Emotional nuance is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the plush and 'shyly loud' trait standing out. Leaves a lingering melancholy. Word count feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
