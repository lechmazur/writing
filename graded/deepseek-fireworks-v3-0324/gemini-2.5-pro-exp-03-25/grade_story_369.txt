<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's fanatical puzzle-making and spiritual tracking are vividly portrayed, but his "optimistically bitter" nature could be more deeply explored to align with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the packages, but the connection between the string and the "weight of secrets" feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and lethargic excitement tone are masterfully intertwined, creating a haunting atmosphere that amplifies Elias's isolation and internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (string, lighthouse beam) and subtext, though the ending's ambiguity slightly undermines its impact. The writing style is evocative but occasionally verbose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases verge on overly ornate. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though Elias's bitterness could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative well. The lingering tension of the second letter adds depth.</comment>
