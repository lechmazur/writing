<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "undercover" role feels underdeveloped. Her reaction to the plant reveals depth, though her distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the twist about the plant's role is well-executed. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The workshop's biomechanical heart is vividly rendered, and sensory details (hissing pistons, pulsating veins) create a rich, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shoelace as mundanity vs. cosmic stakes) and a resonant ending. The theme of containment vs. ambition is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, though the "test of faith" concept leans slightly generic. The plant's paradoxical nature is brilliantly handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers.</comment>
