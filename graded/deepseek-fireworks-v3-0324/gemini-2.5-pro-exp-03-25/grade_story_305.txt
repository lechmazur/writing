<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reticence and scholarly nature are well-integrated, but her motivation to "dethrone complacency" feels slightly abstract. Her technical mischief is clear, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. The word limit is used efficiently, though the cake timer feels slightly tangential.</comment>
