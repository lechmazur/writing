<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is vivid and haunting, though her mathematical struggle feels slightly underdeveloped in relation to her grand ambition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by her obsession, but the climax's logic (dream-shards as storm catalysts) strains credulity without deeper setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exquisitely rendered—petrified tree, desolate Earth—and amplifies Elara's isolation. Sensory details (brittle pages, static-like mania) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (fragmented self, stolen dreams) and evocative prose, though the ending's emotional punch is muted by the abstract resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept, with fresh metaphors ("trying to hold smoke"). Only minor stiffness in the Sky-Sail exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a poignant whole, but the sport-as-key device feels slightly contrived. Lingers hauntingly nonetheless.</comment>
