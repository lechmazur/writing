<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear but their "social media exorcist" role feels underdeveloped. Their actions align with curiosity, but the unique profession isn't fully leveraged.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but lacks tension. The infiltration feels routine rather than revelatory. Pacing is smooth, but the arc is subtle to the point of being slight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—decay and secrecy are vividly rendered. Sensory details (dust, dim light) immerse effectively, though the mess hall could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext (receipt as mundanity vs. hidden lives), but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but not resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("digital hauntings"), though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Avoids clichés but risks stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels like a vignette rather than a complete narrative. The length suits the mood, but depth is hinted, not fully realized.</comment>
