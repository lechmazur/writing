<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and deeply woven into their ethereal nature, though their "expectantly resigned" attitude could be more vividly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the celestial alignment and cane's dissonance driving the breach logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and original, with sensory details (ozone, unshed tears) elevating the atmosphere. The facility's humming power is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cane as chaos, chorus as order) and a haunting ending leave lasting impact. The prose is lyrical without sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("stitched starlight"). Avoids clich√©s, though "ethereal grit" slightly over-relies on juxtaposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, amplifying the story's mythic weight.</comment>
