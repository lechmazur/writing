<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Galen's telepathy and bronze form create a compelling, distinct character. His motivation to find truth is clear and drives his actions, though his passive role slightly limits dynamic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit. The scribe's epiphany serves as a subtle but effective resolution, though the council's deceit could be more directly challenged.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting and gloomy cheerfulness are vividly rendered, with sensory details (coal smoke, hissing steam) enhancing immersion. The hair tie's symbolism ties setting to theme flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hair tie, calligraphy) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though Galen's internal processing could be slightly more varied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dictated falsehoods"). Nuanced emotion and consistent tone avoid clichés. Only minor stiffness in Galen's introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering impact—truth's fragility in systemic corruption.</comment>
