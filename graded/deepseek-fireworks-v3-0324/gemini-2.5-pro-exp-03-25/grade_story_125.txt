<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's underachieving mage persona and motivation to break his cycle of apathy are clear and compelling, though his internal conflict could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the misdelivered packages and final unveiling creating a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland setting is vividly atmospheric, with sensory details (static, groaning conduits) enhancing the eerie mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (doll head as catalyst) and subtext (heritage as a tool against apathy). The ending is purposeful and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The doll head's "exceptionally usual" nature is a standout twist. Nuanced emotional handling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about Kael’s potential.</comment>
