<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's stoicism and motivation are clear, but his "brash tenderness" feels slightly inconsistent with his otherwise reserved nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the resolution feels abrupt, lacking deeper exploration of the teacher's concession.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details like the "chalk dust" and "sterile earth" enhancing the eerie, arcane mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (floorboard as conduit) and subtext, though the ending could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The floorboard's role is inventive, and the tone avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about preservation vs. danger.</comment>
