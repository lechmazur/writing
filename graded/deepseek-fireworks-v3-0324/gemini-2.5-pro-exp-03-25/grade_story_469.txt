<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, blending survival instinct with a nuanced sense of duty. His "logically emotional" state is well-integrated, though his "blameless smuggler" persona could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the countdown and overreach action driving urgency. Coherence is strong, though the fissure discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and moon-petal scent create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are exceptional, but the "grandiose modesty" tone occasionally clashes with the setting's decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the key as symbol) are effective, and the theme of survival resonates. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>
