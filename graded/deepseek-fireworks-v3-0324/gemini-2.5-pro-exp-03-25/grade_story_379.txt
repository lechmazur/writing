<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias Vance's background as a trickster lawyer and his current mission to catalogue disappearing languages are compelling and well-integrated, though his "impatiently patient" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the diversion of the drones, but the connection between the rivals' dares and Elias's linguistic work feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's tension, though the "futuristic farm" aspect could be more distinctively futuristic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (the gift tag) and subtext (chosen paths), but the emotional resonance of Elias's conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though the rivals' cryptic dares border on contrivance. The prose is purposeful and avoids purple tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and leaves a lingering question about Elias's dual identities, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>
