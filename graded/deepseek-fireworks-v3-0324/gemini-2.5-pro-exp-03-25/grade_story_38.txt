<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His obsession with botanical samples and non-violence is compelling, though his drunken confessions could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's actions, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The connection between subway stops and the attic’s whispers is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic’s haunted atmosphere is masterfully rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The setting deeply influences Elias’s actions and the story’s eerie tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (plants as memory) are effective, and the theme of non-violence resonates. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clichés. The handling of Elias’s insomnia and the attic’s sentience feels fresh, though some metaphors border on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering question about the whispers’ origin, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
