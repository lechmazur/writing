<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's spectral sensitivity and motivation to help ghosts are compelling, but his "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels underutilized in driving deeper character exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, though the ghost tour subplot slightly disrupts the tight focus on the lab and the ghost. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's eerie atmosphere and the contrast between preservation and ephemerality are masterfully rendered, but the "dissonance of silence" could be more vividly sensory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sand castles, flower crown) and emotional weight elevate the story, but the ending lacks definitive resolution, leaving some thematic threads loose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and haunting, with minimal clichés. The ghost’s backstory feels fresh, though Elias’s profession slightly strains believability in this context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette that lingers, though the ghost tour detour slightly dilutes its intensity. The length feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
