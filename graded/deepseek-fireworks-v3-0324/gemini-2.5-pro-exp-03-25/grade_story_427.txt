<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's mechanical arm and philosophical duel background are compelling, but his motivation to "weave dreams" feels slightly abstract. His desperation is clear, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed in the confrontation. The sock's significance is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly atmospheric, with strong sensory details (salt-laced air, rusted hinges) enhancing the tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit slightly hampers deeper exploration of the philosophical stakes.</comment>
