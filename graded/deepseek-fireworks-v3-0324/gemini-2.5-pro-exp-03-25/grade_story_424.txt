<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's quiet zealotry and singular focus on sacrifice are compelling, but her "oddly typical" appearance feels underdeveloped in contrast to her intense internal drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the visualization of forgotten wishes driving a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution leans slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory's decaying grandeur and the city's unrest create a rich, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust motes, brittle paper) enhance the mood brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (banknotes as "compressed history") and subtext. The ending's sorrowful resonance lingers, though the theme of sacrifice borders on didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but some phrases ("paper cuts of the soul") verge on cliché. The handling of emotion is nuanced but occasionally overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. The brevity feels deliberate, and the elements serve the story’s depth rather than constrain it.</comment>
