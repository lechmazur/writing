<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply personal, with his actions and emotions aligning well with his "professionally wild" attribute. His longing for freedom and connection to his daughter adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with quarantine serving as a strong narrative constraint. The connection between Kael's isolation and Elara's milestone is poignant, though the word limit slightly rushes resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The high-altitude setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (prayer flags, thin air) enhancing atmosphere. The ozone station contrasts effectively with Kael’s artistry, reinforcing themes of confinement and creativity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flag, sculpture) and layered themes (freedom, sacrifice) elevate the story. The ending is resonant, though slightly explicit in its thematic summation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "audacious meekness"). Avoids clichés, though the paddleboarding connection feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering emotional impact, though the ozone station’s relevance could be sharper.</comment>
