<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with her grief, but her "late-blooming hero" trait feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her obsession, but the heroism aspect lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's quest, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending resolves her immediate goal but feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances Elara's isolation. The rooftop farm and scarred moons are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong imagery and subtext. However, the emotional impact is slightly muted by the brevity, and the theme of cosmic balance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The writing avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The style is purposeful, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements, but the length feels restrictive. It leaves a lingering thought but could benefit from more space to breathe.</comment>
