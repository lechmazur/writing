<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alistair's agoraphobia and mayoral burden are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His actions align perfectly with his desperation to escape legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the rain's rhythm driving the action logically. The arc feels complete, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The dunes and rain create a haunting atmosphere, deeply connected to Alistair's emotional state. Sensory details (ozone, sand) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (snuffbox as burden), evocative prose, and a resonant ending elevate this. The conflict between duty and freedom is subtly powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. Avoids clich√©s, and the agoraphobic mayor in the desert is a striking inversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of possibility.</comment>
