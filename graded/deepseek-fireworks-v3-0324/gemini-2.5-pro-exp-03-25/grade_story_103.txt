<question>1</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is deeply etched into the narrative, with his regret and yearning for a lost path vividly portrayed. His younger self's dilemma and the older knight's reflection create a compelling duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mirrored reflection serving as a brilliant device to explore past and present. The pacing is masterful, and the resolution feels earned despite the brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are hauntingly evocative, enhancing the knight's isolation. The sun-drenched courtyard contrast is striking, and sensory details (waves, gulls) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (glove, petals, scroll) and layered emotion. The ending is poignant yet subtly hopeful, with subtext about sacrifice and self-forgiveness lingering powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("joyful agony," "salt-scars of the sea") and nuanced handling of regret elevate this beyond cliché. The voice is distinct, avoiding AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Every element serves the story’s emotional core. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant ache. A standout example of micro-literary craft.</comment>
