<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Finnian's motivation is clear and consistent, his actions reveal a deeply introspective yet foolhardy nature, and his distinct voice shines through the confessional tapes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Finnian's research to his decree, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
