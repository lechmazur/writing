<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Agnes' motivation is clear and compelling, blending her mundane expertise with extraordinary circumstances. Her "cynically gentle" nature is subtly woven into her actions and voice, though deeper introspection could elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the moon-cycle vulnerability and pressed flowers creating a logical, original resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the time machine's role could be slightly clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional—the "shadows learning to speak" and the garage's contrast with Agnes' baking background create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (flour, cold metal) are deftly used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (flowers as antidote, dough as rebellion) and a resonant theme of cyclical resistance. The ending is poignant and thematically cohesive, though a touch more subtext could make it flawless.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The baker-temporal-rebel premise feels fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "sourdough hope") are inventive. Minor stiffness in phrasing ("resonant frequency of uncorrupted life").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-perfect balance of assigned elements. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering emotional impact. Only a hair more thematic depth would make it unimpeachable.</comment>
