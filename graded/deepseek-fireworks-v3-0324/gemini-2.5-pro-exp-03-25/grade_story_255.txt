<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her synesthetic method revealing depth. Her "innocent cynicism" voice is distinct, though her nondescript nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the USB drive and rain-scent method driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the party's connection to the relic could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with the abandoned tower and post-party hush enhancing tension. Petrichor as a sensory key is brilliantly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: synesthesia as decryption is original, themes of justice and truth resonate, and the ending satisfies. Literary devices (e.g., "ghosts of laughter") elevate the prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original—no clichés, fresh metaphors (e.g., "weather patterns forming across a digital landscape"). Nuanced emotion and style avoid AI-generic pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate; elements serve the story’s depth. Lingers on the cost of truth-seeking, proving brevity can be potent.</comment>
