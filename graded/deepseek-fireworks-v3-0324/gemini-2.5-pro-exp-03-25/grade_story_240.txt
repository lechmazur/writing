<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, blending pragmatism with a desire for elemental influence. Her actions align perfectly with her "lavishly humble" facade and deeper ambitions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the hammer's rhythmic strikes driving the resolution logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's tension could linger more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gnarled village and its precarious setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's eerie, organic tension. Sensory details (groaning wood, rusted hammer) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: the hammer's "song" as percussive surgery is a striking metaphor. Subtext about control and artifice vs. nature resonates. Ending satisfies while unsettling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept. No clichés; the soothsayer's pragmatism and the hammer's role feel fresh. Emotion is shown through action (e.g., sweat-wiping as satisfaction).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story’s theme of constructed power. Leaves a lingering unease about Elara's influence, suggesting depth.</comment>
