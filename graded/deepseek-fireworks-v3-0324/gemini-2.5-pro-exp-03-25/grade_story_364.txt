<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions consistently. His "skewed visionary" trait is well-integrated, though his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between pottery and temporal mechanics feels slightly forced. The ending resolves elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with evocative sensory details (old paper, woodsmoke). The anomaly study setting enhances the theme of fading history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lichen as resilience) and subtext. The ending lingers, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The fusion of botany and hieroglyphs feels fresh, but minor phrasing ("mundane miracles") leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a resonant question about preservation and perception.</comment>
