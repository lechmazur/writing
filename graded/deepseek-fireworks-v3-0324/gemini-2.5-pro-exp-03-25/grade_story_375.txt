<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, with her "angry peace" and obsession with imperfection driving her actions. Her distinct voice and consistent reactions to the setting enhance her depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Elara's sabotage plans to her search for guidance. The connection between her method and the city's decay is logical but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rusting catwalks, flickering light) amplifying the atmosphere. The radio tower city and its eerie mannequins perfectly complement Elara's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flashlight, mannequins) and subtext (brokenness as power). The ending is purposeful, though the stellar wrath concept could be more fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "angry peace" and imperfection themes feel fresh, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while maintaining stylistic flair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, leaving a lingering sense of tension. The brevity feels deliberate, and the thematic depth elevates it beyond the word limit.</comment>
