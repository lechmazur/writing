<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jedediah's motivation is clear and compelling, blending physical labor with a deeper quest for healing. His "gracefully awkward" recovery and clumsy handling of herbs add depth, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the coded letter, but the tight word limit forces some abrupt transitions. Pacing is strong, though the ossuary's revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is vividly atmospheric, with polished femurs and unsettling energy. Sensory details (crisp air, metallic letter) immerse the reader, though the "harsh tenderness" tone could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (bones, nightmares) and subtext (healing vs. destruction) are layered, but the ending's resolve lacks emotional punch. Literary craft is strong, though some metaphors verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ossuary's dual role and Jed's lumberjack-healer duality. Avoids clich√©s, but the nightmares' cryptic sequences flirt with predictability. Nuanced emotion elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the letter and ossuary driving the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic depth. A lingering unease lingers effectively.</comment>
