<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the satellite shard discovery driving the narrative logically toward its hopeful resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette that lingers. Elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the brevity feels intentional.</comment>
