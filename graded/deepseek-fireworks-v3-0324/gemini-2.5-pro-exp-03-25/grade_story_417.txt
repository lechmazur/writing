<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Malachi's unhinged zealotry is vividly portrayed, with his motivations and actions deeply intertwined. His childlike conviction and desperate absurdity create a distinct, compelling voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Malachi's uprooting of the fern serving as a clear, symbolic climax. The cause-and-effect logic is strong, though the ending's ambiguity slightly weakens resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jungle-Victorian parlor contrast is masterfully evoked, with sensory details (gaslight, damp earth) enhancing the oppressive atmosphere. The setting amplifies Malachi's isolation and fervor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bottle cap, uprooting) and layered subtext elevate the story. The prose is precise yet poetic, with a haunting ending that lingers. Shows far more than it tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The absurdity feels fresh, and the writing style is distinctive. Nuanced handling of Malachi's fractured psyche avoids AI-generic emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story leaves a visceral impression, balancing thematic depth with unsettling ambiguity.</comment>
