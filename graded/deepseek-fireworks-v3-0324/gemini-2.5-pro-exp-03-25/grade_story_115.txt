<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and cautiousness are well-balanced, driving her actions believably. Her motivation to make amends is clear, though Kael's absence slightly weakens the dynamic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the reforging, but the ease of wish-fragment collection feels slightly contrived. Pacing is strong, though resolution is ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nano-scale city and its eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like "uncertain heartbeats" of lights are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (mask, wishes) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending's uncertainty is purposeful, though slightly muted in emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The "wish-powered reforging" concept is inventive, and prose avoids purple tendencies while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the mask and city reinforcing theme. Length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
