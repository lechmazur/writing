<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his fear and isolation driving his actions. His distinct voice and the revelation of his internal struggle through interaction with Anya are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from pursuit to revelation. The meditative trance transition feels slightly abrupt but serves the thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's ethereal tone. Sensory details like "flour dusting his worn jacket" ground the surreal elements effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (chessboard, shadows) and subtext (trust vs. isolation). The ending is purposeful, though the theme of diversity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The grotto's concept and Elias's ability feel fresh, though the cooking-class meet-cute slightly strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for lingering reflection.</comment>
