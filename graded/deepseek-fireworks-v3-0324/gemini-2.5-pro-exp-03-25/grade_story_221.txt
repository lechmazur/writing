<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kai's dual identity as a wreck-diver and ghost whisperer is subtly woven into their introspection, revealing depth. The motivation to redefine tradition is clear but could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is coherent, with the letter and amber serving as anchors, but the transition from rebellion to resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is vividly rendered, with decay and light used masterfully to mirror Kai’s emotional state. Sensory details elevate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (amber, dust motes) and layered subtext about memory and forgiveness create impact. The ending resonates, though the letter’s unresolved nature slightly weakens closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of manufactured joy") avoid cliché. Nuanced melancholy feels authentic, though some phrasing edges toward over-poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the carnival and amber enriching theme. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
