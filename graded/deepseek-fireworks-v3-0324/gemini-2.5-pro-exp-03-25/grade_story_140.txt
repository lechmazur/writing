<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's tortured protector role is compelling, but his motivation could be more explicitly tied to his past failures. His voice is distinct, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The doll's introduction via the planetarium feels slightly abrupt but ultimately serves the story.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—abandoned circus and eerie dawn amplify the uncanny. Sensory details are vivid and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll as cosmic gatekeeper) and subtext. Ending is purposeful, though the "cosmic horror" reveal could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The doll's "suspiciously sweet" duality is particularly inventive. Minor overuse of "frayed spirit" phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste. Could tighten the planetarium link.</comment>
