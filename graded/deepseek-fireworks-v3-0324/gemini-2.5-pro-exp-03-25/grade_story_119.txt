<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with actions aligned to survival. The "secret astral projector" trait adds depth, though his "unyielding compassion" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the "sun shadows" method feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (ozone, rust, shadows). The abandoned carnival amplifies tension, though the roller coaster's decay could be more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., "phantom scent," "skeletal shadows"). Ending is purposeful, but the theme of compassion vs. survival could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though "sometimes always" phrasing is awkward. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with creative integration. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering tension. Minor quibbles with "sun shadows" and "sometimes always."</comment>
