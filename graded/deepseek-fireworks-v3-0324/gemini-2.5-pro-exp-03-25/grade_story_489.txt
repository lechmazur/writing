<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in their spectral existence, but their 'voice' could be more distinct to enhance their ethereal presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the whale's call and dancer's step creating a compelling temporal anchor. Pacing is excellent, though the resolution could linger slightly more.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is masterfully crafted, with sensory details (salt-laced stone, whale's moan) immersing the reader. The lighthouse setting is hauntingly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (whistle as signal flare, whale's song as primal energy) elevates the narrative. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s depth. Leaves a lingering question about tradition’s survival, suggesting thematic richness.</comment>
