<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's distrust and ambition are vividly portrayed, driving her actions consistently. Her "rebelliously docile" facade adds depth, though her internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the candlestick's unlocking serving as a clear climax. Pacing is excellent, though the sewing machine's stoppage feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The guild hall's grime and arcane undercurrents are masterfully evoked. Sensory details (coal dust, ozone) deepen immersion, and the setting amplifies Elara's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (seashell, candlestick) and subtext (legacy vs. institutional rigidity) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates, though the theme could be more explicitly threaded earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The seashell method is inventive, but some phrasing ("nostalgic innovation") leans slightly toward forced lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette. The brevity feels intentional, and the fusion of elements (mage, guild hall) is ingenious. Leaves a lingering sense of hidden potential.</comment>
