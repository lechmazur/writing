<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and deeply personal, blending his professional decline with a physical struggle. His "sweetly fierce" determination is subtly shown through his mediation efforts, though his illusionist background could be more integrated into his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mediation, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The walkie-talkie method is inventive but risks gimmickry. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground fairy city and "memory of fire" are vividly imagined, with sensory details (static, peeling paint) enhancing atmosphere. The cosmic timeframe adds mystique but slightly strains cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fan, fireworks) and subtext (personal vs. collective salvation). The ending is purposeful but could linger more. Dialogue (via static) is clever but limited.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, avoiding clich√©s. The walkie-talkie device and genetic tremor are fresh twists. Some phrases ("cosmic possibility") edge toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively, with creative integration (e.g., fan as conductor). The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting question about Alistair's fate.</comment>
