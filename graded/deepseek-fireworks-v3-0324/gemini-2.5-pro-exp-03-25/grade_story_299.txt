<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and nuanced, blending personal history with communal duty. Her "unsure champion" status is well-explored, but her internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a logical progression from problem to solution. The "living exhibition" idea is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (church bells, sea thrift) enhancing the melancholic yet defiant atmosphere. The colony feels tangible and urgent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amber brooch, bells) and subtext (imperfect love as both burden and fuel). The ending resonates, though the theme could be more sharply honed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors ("cheerful gloom"). Avoids clich√©s, but some phrasing leans slightly ornate ("rationally rebellious spirit").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about resilience in the face of cultural erosion.</comment>
