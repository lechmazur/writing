<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "coy" nature feels underdeveloped compared to her burning ambition. The duality of her confidence (or lack thereof) is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear cause-and-effect arc. The time reversal is inventive but risks feeling gimmicky without deeper thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brewery's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the "morning paper" timeframe feels slightly underutilized. The setting enhances the story's mood perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of literary devices (e.g., "borrowed valor"), but the ending's hollowness, while intentional, lacks emotional punch. The theme of shortcuts vs. mastery is compelling but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "diabolically benevolent" descriptor leans slightly toward tropes. The prose is fresh but occasionally over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the tight word limit slightly truncates thematic depth. Leaves a lingering question about authenticity in mastery.</comment>
