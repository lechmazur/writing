<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris Thorne's obsession with temple inscriptions and his desperate turn to coffee grounds reveal a compelling, layered motivation. His actions align well with his established traits, though his physician background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the cutlass discovery and coffee-ground revelation driving urgency. Pacing is excellent, and the cause-effect chain (disturbed artifact → weakening magic) is clear and logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the digital nomad camp and ancient temple creates a rich, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (cold steel, trembling earth) enhance immersion, though the camp's modernity could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose, potent symbolism (cutlass as anchor, coffee as oracle), and a haunting ending elevate this. The theme of disturbed history demanding resolution is masterfully conveyed through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The coffee-ground method is inventive, and the tone avoids purple prose. Some phrases ("bleed across the hush") verge on over-poetic but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, impactful whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers with unsettling resonance. A standout example of constrained storytelling.</comment>
