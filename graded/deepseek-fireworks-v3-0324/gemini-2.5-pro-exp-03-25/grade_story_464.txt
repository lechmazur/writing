<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and consistent, her actions reveal a rebellious intellect, and her voice is distinct, though her "sassy cook" persona could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect and effective pacing. The fracture action drives the narrative cohesively to its satisfying end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile, controlled setting contrasts brilliantly with the chaos Anya unleashes. Sensory details (e.g., "non-Euclidean colors") enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices (symbolism in the polaroid, metaphor in "treasure chests"). The ending is purposeful, and the theme of rebellion against order resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is vivid without being purple, and Anya's nuanced mischief feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the story lingers with subversive impact. The brevity feels deliberate, not restrictive.</comment>
