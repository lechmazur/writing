<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The seer's analytically innovative mind and unique method of decoding via scent create a distinct and compelling character, though their 'nondescript' nature could be more vividly contrasted with their extraordinary abilities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the USB drive and relic discovery forming a clear arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the 'surprise party' setup feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and sensory details (dust, fairy lights, petrichor) are masterfully woven into the atmosphere, enhancing both mystery and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (justice as petrichor) and subtext. The ending satisfies while leaving room for reflection, and the prose elevates the story beyond its brief length.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clich√©s. The scent-based decoding method is ingeniously specific, though the 'innocent cynicism' tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lingering impression of justice as a sensory revelation.</comment>
