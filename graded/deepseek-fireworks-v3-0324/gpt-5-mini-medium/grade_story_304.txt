<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is poetic yet enigmatic, blending tenderness with violence in a way that elevates his character above cliché. His voice and introspection are distinct, though his actions occasionally border on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot's cohesion suffers slightly from abrupt tonal shifts, but the spider's web metaphor threads through effectively. The ending is ambiguous yet purposeful, though the middle feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric detail—nebula-lit balustrades, oil-glazed roads—immerses the reader. The baroque asteroid setting is vividly original, though its theatricality sometimes overshadows narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich with lyrical symbolism (lens as rosary, laughter as "ribbon of borrowed starlight"). The theme of fragile redemption resonates, though the prose occasionally veers into overwrought territory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique voice defy AI tropes, but the assassin's dichotomy (tender yet lethal) edges toward a well-worn archetype. The spider's web motif feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette that leverages its brevity. The elements serve the story, though the asteroid's grandeur occasionally distracts from the emotional core.</comment>
