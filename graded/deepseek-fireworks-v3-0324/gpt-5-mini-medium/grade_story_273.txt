<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The incognito aristocrat's motivation is clear, compelling, and subtly revealed through actions and symbolism. Their "strangely honest" attribute adds depth and distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is elegantly structured with a clear arc, though the cosmic prelude feels slightly detached from the grounded rebellion. Pacing is deftly managed despite brevity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and profound. Elements serve the story organically, leaving a lingering meditation on memory and power. Length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
