<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's transformation from city planner to temple-bound prepper is vivid and well-motivated; her "unyielding will" drives actions consistently, though her "rarely authentic" trait feels under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically, with the handshake as a pivot, but the tight word count leaves some cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., escape plan execution) slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive—frescoes, ink-scented air, and lacquered cupboards create a rich sensory tapestry that amplifies the tension between ritual and reason.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (ink blotter as talisman, blueprints as chains) and subtext (bureaucracy vs. rebellion). Ending resonates with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés; metaphors (constellations as alleyways) feel fresh. Minor stumbles: "rarely authentic" repetition, some overly ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly—temple setting and ink blotter feel integral. Brief length serves the story’s intensity; leaves reader pondering freedom’s duality.</comment>
