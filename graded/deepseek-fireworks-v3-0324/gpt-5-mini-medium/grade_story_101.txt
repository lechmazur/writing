<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's character is vividly realized—her warmth, manic clarity, and role as a guide for tenants are consistent and compelling. Her "cryptically obvious" advice and actions with the bee pin reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is elegantly structured around the parade's detour, using it to drive tenants into the studio and Mara's adaptive teachings. Pacing is tight, and cause-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The studio's atmosphere is immersive, with sensory details (lemon oil, brass pin) enriching the mood. The setting amplifies the theme of adaptation and unrecorded truths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (bee pin as history), layered metaphors (endings as "foldable plans"), and a resonant theme of reimagining fear. Dialogue is sharp and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original voice; avoids clichés. The bee pin’s half-true origin story and Mara’s manic clarity feel fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Elements serve the story’s depth, leaving a lingering question about adaptation and resilience. No sense of constraint.</comment>
