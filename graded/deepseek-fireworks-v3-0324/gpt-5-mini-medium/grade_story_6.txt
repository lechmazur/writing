<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced within the word limit, but the resolution hinges slightly too much on the trickster's reaction, which feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (e.g., the dragon-scale scrap as both answer and riddle) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the trickster's immediate capitulation slightly undercuts tension.</comment>
