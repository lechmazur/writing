<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The DJ's duality—playful in public, solemn in private—is compelling, and his reverence for the ritualistic mapping feels authentic. However, deeper internal conflict or backstory could elevate him further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from filing to revelation, but the thread method's abrupt introduction slightly disrupts coherence. The arc is poetic but could tighten causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse's alchemical-night atmosphere is exquisitely rendered, with copper, jasmine, and borrowed starlight creating a haunting, immersive mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (records as petitions, thread as cartography) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending resonates, though the central conflict could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "north" as a scent). Minimal clichés, though the "hesitant constellation" risks slight over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, but the sweater thread feels slightly contrived. The brevity serves the mystique, leaving a lingering sense of sacred discovery.</comment>
