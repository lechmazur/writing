<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's irony as a humorless comedic actor is compelling, but motivation to bottle a star's breath feels slightly abstract. Actions align with grief, though "objectively personal" gifts could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot meanders deliberately but achieves coherence. Pacing is effective, though the climax (bottling his own breath) could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly vivid—playground and wilderness merge beautifully. Inkwell's dryness as an "accusation" is a standout sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (inkwell as memory vessel) and subtext about artistic grief. Ending is poignant, though the fox's cameo feels slightly ornamental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice; metaphors feel fresh (e.g., "memory like a shot already diluted"). No AI tropes—nuanced handling of silence as a stage.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the tension between performance and authenticity.</comment>
