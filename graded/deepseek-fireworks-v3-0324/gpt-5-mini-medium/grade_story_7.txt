<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentient doll collector's motivation and actions are consistently aligned, weaving a compelling blend of resignation and purpose. Her "expectantly resigned" attribute deepens her eerie yet determined persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves cohesion within the tight word limit, though the "chorus of healing" concept feels slightly underdeveloped as a driving force. Pacing is strong but leans atmospheric over plot-centric.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nectar collection facility is vividly rendered with sensory richness, blending industrial and sacred tones seamlessly. The twisted carnival cane and star paths enhance the haunting, liminal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., "fossilized constellation") elevate the prose. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict—testing taboos—could be sharper. Theme resonates through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors avoid clichés. The doll collector’s paradoxical grit and ethereality feel uniquely human. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative vignette. Elements serve the story’s mood over strict plot, but the brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering uncanny beauty.</comment>
