<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, blending rebellion with a tangible relic (butter churn). His "honestly strange" nature feels organic, though his detachment risks undercutting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a strong arc, but the ascent via poster edges strains plausibility. Pacing is tight, though the climax's impact slightly dilutes due to abrupt technical reveals.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—decadent space station and post-arboreal decay are vividly rendered. The butter churn's rusticity contrasts brilliantly with sterile futurism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (churn as reliquary, circuits as illusion) and subtext about truth vs. comfort. Ending satisfies, though some metaphors verge on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clichés; "aloof passion" and "rebellious sparks" feel fresh. Minor stumbles: "pixel dust" leans generic, and the merchant's clinical passion borders on robotic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere powerfully, but the poster-as-ladder detracts slightly. Lingers on themes of authenticity, though the climax's physicality clashes with earlier subtlety.</comment>
