<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's hesitancy and "shyly loud" demeanor are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation tied to the dinosaur plush. His actions align well with his mission, though some nuance in his voice could deepen his distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the dream-hopping machines, with a clear arc from setup to resolution. Pacing is tight but effective, though the anachronism misfires feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and "crossing of a year" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (cedar, old songs) enrich the world and reinforce the bard's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("fragile loom of time") and symbolism (the plush as a "ledger of small survivals"). The ending is poignant, and the theme of mending regret resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and minimal cliché. The emotional nuance (e.g., "brittle wonder") feels genuine, though a few phrases skirt precarity ("sheepish herald").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive fusion of elements. The brevity serves the story’s lyrical density, leaving a lingering impact. The dream-hopping conceit is particularly ingenious.</comment>
