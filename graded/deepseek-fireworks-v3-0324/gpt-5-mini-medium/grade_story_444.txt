<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambassador's motivation is clear, but her 'fierce' nature feels underdeveloped. The ghost costume adds fragility but doesn't fully integrate with her diplomatic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the chain of letters concept shines, but the zeppelin setting feels underutilized in driving the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset—evocative sensory details (radio static, salt-and-grease ink) create a haunting, immersive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) elevate the prose, but the ending lacks definitive resolution, leaving thematic impact slightly diluted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés—the concept of shared dreams and letters across time feels fresh, though some phrasing verges on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements, but the sunken zeppelin and radio static feel more decorative than essential to the core theme.</comment>
