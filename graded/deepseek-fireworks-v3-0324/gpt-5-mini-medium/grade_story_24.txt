<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear and deeply woven into their actions; their "ordinarily extraordinary" perspective is consistently revealed through their unique methods of storytelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the lull before the text, with a clear cause-and-effect chain. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the bookstore's vastness slightly distracts from the bar's intimacy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and seedy bar are vividly rendered, with sensory details (coal-lit basements, sticky stools) enhancing the atmosphere. The dentures' warmth ties the setting to the core concept beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (dentures as embers) and subtext (apology through art). The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving a lingering warmth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors ("sow feelings," "fractured idyll"). Avoids clich√©s and algorithmic predictability, with nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers beyond its final line.</comment>
