<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's cosmic powers and academically wild nature are intriguingly juxtaposed with his mundane factory role, creating depth. His motivation to break free from inherited rules is clear and compelling, though slightly underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the ritual as a clever vehicle for introspection. The ending feels earned, though the cosmic powers' integration could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The gargoyle-terraced abyss and corridor are vividly haunting, amplifying the story's tension. Sensory details (e.g., the cameo's "cold plainness") enrich the atmosphere masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ledger, cameo) and layered themes elevate the narrative. The ending resonates, though the cosmic elements occasionally overshadow emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally original voice and fresh metaphors ("algebra of constellations"). Avoids clich√©s and formulaic prose, though the "cosmic powers" trope risks feeling lofty without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, bold fusion of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. The cameo's role as both compass and rebellion is particularly inspired.</comment>
