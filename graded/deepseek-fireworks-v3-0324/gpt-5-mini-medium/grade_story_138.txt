<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation and personality are vividly rendered, with a distinct voice and layered contradictions. However, the aristocratic aspect feels slightly underdeveloped compared to his psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though the lab setting's relevance to the narrative feels tenuous at times.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich with sensory details, but the "spontaneous combustion lab" clashes tonally with the introspective focus. The timeframe ("between text messages") is clever but underutilized spatially.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext, with a hauntingly memorable ending. The drone and stubs elevate the storytelling beyond mere vignette status.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors, though some phrasing edges toward over-poeticism. The "hollow recklessness" motif occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive and resonant micro-narrative that leverages its constraints artfully. Only the lab setting feels marginally forced.</comment>
