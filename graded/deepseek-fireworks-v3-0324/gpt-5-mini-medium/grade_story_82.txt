<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's reluctance and analytical playfulness are vividly portrayed, but his motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" feels slightly abstract. Actions align well with traits, though deeper nuance could elevate it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the futuristic hub's role feels underexplored. The dragon tooth discovery drives the arc effectively, though resolution is subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—sensory details like "bruised fruit" and "mineral and time" create a haunting, immersive world. The cursed orchard and hidden sunrise harmonize beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of literary devices (e.g., "orchard tilt toward revelation and dread"). Subtext about progress vs. forgotten voices is potent. Ending is poetic and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dragon tooth's mysticism and the orchard's curse. Language avoids cliché, though some metaphors ("secret throat") edge toward over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, haunting whole. The futuristic hub slightly disrupts tone, but the story’s brevity feels deliberate and powerful.</comment>
