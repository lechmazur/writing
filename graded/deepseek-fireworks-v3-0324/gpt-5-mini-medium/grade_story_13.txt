<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordsman's solemnity and motivation are clear, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. His actions align with his role as a steward of evolutionary whispers, though deeper introspection could elevate his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and logically driven by the poems and box, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the garden's revelation. Cause-and-effect is clear, though pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Outstanding atmosphere—sensory details (ozone, thyme, cobweb mercury) enrich the toppled tower and garden. The setting and timeframe harmonize perfectly with the tone and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (metaphors like "time made fragile") and subtext about stewardship elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, though the central conflict is subtle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh imagery (e.g., "annotated moonbeams"). Avoids clichés and purple prose, though some phrases verge on overly ornate ("concentric patience").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering meditation on transience, though the swordsman's emotional depth could be sharper.</comment>
