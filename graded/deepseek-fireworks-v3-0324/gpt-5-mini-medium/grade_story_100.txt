<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dreamer's defiance and reverence are well-balanced, and their obsession with the pennies reveals depth, though their "ravenous agenda" could be more explicitly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is cohesive and satisfying despite the brevity, with clear cause-and-effect logic. Pacing is strong, though the ending leans slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (lichen, moonlight) reinforcing the dreamlike tone. The statues and guardian amplify the tension perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and layered symbolism (coins as confessions, the guardian's patience) elevate the story. The unresolved apology adds poignant subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Remarkably original, with fresh metaphors (clockwork lung, "algebra of a lie"). No clich√©s; the voice feels distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements meld seamlessly into a haunting, cohesive whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering thematic weight.</comment>
