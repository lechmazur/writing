<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tailor's nostalgia and quiet menace are vividly rendered, but his motivation to "ascend beyond mortal limits" feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s surreal logic unfolds with poetic coherence, though the tight word count forces some transitions to feel abrupt. The mirror’s role as a portal is masterfully integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—coal, rain, and humming machinery evoke a haunting steampunk melancholy. The mirror’s menace and the storm’s rhythm deepen the setting’s immersive power.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with layered metaphors (stitched memories, lightning as thread) and a haunting thematic exploration of duality. The ending’s ambiguity lingers, though the confessional dialogue borders on overly stylized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery, but a few phrases ("negotiated their own pace," "perform rituals") edge toward formulaic abstraction. The emotional core remains piercingly human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements, with only minor stiffness in the tailor’s esoteric goal. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant questions about identity and transcendence.</comment>
