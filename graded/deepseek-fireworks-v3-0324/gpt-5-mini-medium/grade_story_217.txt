<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistently aligned with their traits. The 'underestimated rebel' attribute shapes their actions well, but the 'sadly joyful' attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, though the ending feels slightly rushed. The method of 'intensifying' wonder is effective but could be more tightly woven into the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory details. The haunted amusement park setting enhances the story's mood, but the 'ephemeral gloom' tone occasionally feels overbearing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes emotion. However, the theme of 'priming a stagnant heart for wonder' could be more subtly integrated into the narrative's fabric.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and minimal clich√©s. Some phrases border on overly poetic, but the voice remains distinct and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with creative use of assigned elements. The brief length works, though some themes could be explored deeper without feeling rushed.</comment>
