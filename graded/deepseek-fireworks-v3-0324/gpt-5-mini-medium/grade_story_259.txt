<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ira's "normally unusual" aura and tender motivation for collecting myths are vividly portrayed, giving her a distinct and memorable presence. Her actions align seamlessly with her traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically, with the accidental meeting and mural collaboration driving a cohesive arc. Pacing is tight but unhurried, resolving with satisfying subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant's atmosphere—varnish fumes, servo whirs—is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (salt, solder-tinged tea) deepen the world's strangeness and warmth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: layered symbolism (telescope as compass, mural as living myth), evocative subtext, and a hauntingly tender ending. Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Striking originality in voice and concept. No clichés; metaphors ("telescope fogged as if recalling salt air") are fresh. Emotion is shown, not told, with nuanced subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The story lingers, with the ledger's circuit-wire stitching embodying its themes of permanence and impermanence.</comment>
