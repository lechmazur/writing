<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by his research, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the arc. Cause-and-effect is clear, and the ending feels purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is extraordinary—evocative sensory details (lignin, rain) and the giant’s book amplify atmosphere. The library breathes life into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (metaphors like "moth wings"), subtext about memory and ruin, and a haunting ending elevate this. The "electric peace" lingers.</comment>
