<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel's coy fury and the automaton bird's interpretive role create a compelling dynamic, though the sentinel's shift from unsteady to steady could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, with a clear arc from prophecy to revelation, though the "ambush of fate" feels slightly abrupt despite fitting the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the docking bay and "between worlds colliding" are vividly rendered, with sensory details (salt, coolant, brass feathers) deepening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary craft—metaphors like "futures in reverse" and the manuscript's confession elevate the story. The ending's balance of relief and hurt is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The automaton bird's mechanical lullabies and the prophecy's mundane origin subvert expectations brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly; the story feels deliberate and lingers. A standout example of constrained storytelling's potential.</comment>
