<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prince's loneliness and exile are effectively portrayed through his interactions and the mortar and pestle, though his royal status feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the snowstorm and key-turn serving as elegant structural hinges. Pacing is flawless for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is superb—sensory details (thyme, old coin, snow) deepen the mood. The abandoned customs office feels purposeful but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Impactful storytelling with rich subtext (loneliness as exile, rituals as remedies). Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are expertly deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant, though the "unseen forces" verge on cliché. The prince’s voice occasionally feels too refined for his circumstances.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically layered, with elements serving the story brilliantly. The ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>
