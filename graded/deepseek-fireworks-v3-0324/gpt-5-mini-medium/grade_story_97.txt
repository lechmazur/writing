<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The oracle's fact-mindedness contrasts powerfully with his emotional journey, creating a compelling duality. His motivation is clear and deeply human despite his supernatural role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from concept to resolution, with heartbreak-induced visions elegantly driving the recomposition of memory. Pacing feels deliberate, not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stunning atmospheric cohesion—the unstable dimension's tactile surrealism ("rooms that inhaled") mirrors the oracle's emotional instability. Sensory details are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Profoundly evocative prose with layered symbolism (compass as liturgy, empathy as coordinates). The ending’s quiet resonance lingers beyond the last line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in voice and vision. No clichés; metaphors ("maps dissolved like salt") are fresh. Emotional depth is shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A near-perfect synthesis of elements into a cohesive, haunting whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for contemplation.</comment>
