<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The psychic genealogist is vividly realized, her motivation clear and compelling. Her 'proudly humble' nature and unique method of interpreting diaries deepen her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc despite brevity. The action of 'lengthening' grief ties beautifully to the ending, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich literary craft: layered symbolism (dice, bells), evocative metaphors. The ending lingers, and the theme of fragile hope is poignantly explored.</comment>
