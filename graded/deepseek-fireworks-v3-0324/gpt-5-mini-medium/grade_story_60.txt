<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blacksmith's indifferent exterior masks a deep, unspoken motivation, revealed subtly through actions and objects. His "indifference" is a well-crafted facade, but his ritualistic behavior and connection to the ribbon suggest richer layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the ritual, with a clear arc from initiation to resolution. Pacing is deliberate, leveraging the "between bells" timeframe to heighten tension. Cause and effect are elegantly implied rather than spelled out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The catacombs are vividly rendered, with sensory details (dust, rain-scented ruin) amplifying the mystic atmosphere. The setting actively participates in the narrative, almost as a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and symbolism (the ribbon, the objects as fragments of memory). The prose is lyrical but precise, with metaphors that avoid cliché. The ending satisfies by leaving the covenant's terms ambiguous yet potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, with no clichés or formulaic turns. The blacksmith's "haw" and the ribbon's symbolism feel fresh. Minor deduction for slightly over-poetic phrasing in places ("slow geometry of falling").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story’s theme of quiet covenant, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers in the mind due to its restrained yet evocative power.</comment>
