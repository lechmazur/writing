<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's literal interpretation of the world and his brazen calm are vividly portrayed, driving his actions and interactions with the world. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his 'bright-eyed' trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the action of overcharging the beacon, with logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the ending feels satisfyingly resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-war water scarcity backdrop are richly atmospheric, enhancing the eerie, speculative mood. Sensory details (humming metal, damp stones) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using vivid symbolism (phone booth key, star maps) and a layered central conflict (knowledge vs. risk). The ending is resonant, and the theme of literal vs. metaphorical thinking is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original and free of clich√©s, with fresh metaphors ("glass purred like a planet"). The writing avoids AI pitfalls, maintaining a consistent, unique voice and nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where all elements serve the narrative. The brief length feels deliberate, and the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
