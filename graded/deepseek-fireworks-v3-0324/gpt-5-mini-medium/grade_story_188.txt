<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ex-lawman's internal conflict and transformation are vividly rendered, though his backstory could be more fleshed out. His motivation to escape violence is compelling but slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The letter’s misdelivery is a clever catalyst, though its resolution feels marginally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with rich sensory details. The castle’s decay mirrors the protagonist’s state, though the "corroded rapture" tone is slightly overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spectacles, seeds) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the prose occasionally veers into excessive lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the "probably improbable" phrasing feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant. The brevity works, but the story could linger longer on the protagonist’s decision.</comment>
