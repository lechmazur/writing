<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The former game show host's motivations are clear and consistent, but his transformation could be more deeply explored. The bitter honey motif works well but slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed, particularly the sabotage subplot. The connection between beginning and end is strong, but pacing suffers in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Superb atmosphere—sensory details (crickets, salt, vinegar) are evocative. The insect symphony hall is brilliantly realized, though the crystal ball’s pulsing could be more grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices, though the ending’s "gentle overturn" feels slightly abrupt. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The bitter honey motif risks repetition but is otherwise fresh. Nuanced emotion, though the sabotage rationale could be less clinical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, with creative use of elements. The length feels deliberate, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
