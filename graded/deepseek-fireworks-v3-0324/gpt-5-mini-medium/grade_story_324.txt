<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The insecure advisor is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and internal conflict, though his reliance on the jar occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by curiosity, but the resolution ("steadier and utterly undone") feels slightly abrupt for the buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—corridors "fold like promises," jar pulses ambiguously—but the "simmering future" timeframe isn't fully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich subtext (jar as conscience, echoes as guilt), though the dreamer's calling could be sharper. Ending lingers hauntingly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, with fresh metaphors ("compass made of absence"). Only minor over-reliance on "clearly ambiguous."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a visceral unease about truth-seeking.</comment>
