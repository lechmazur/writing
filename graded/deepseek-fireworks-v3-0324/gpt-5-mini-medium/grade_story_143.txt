<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character’s nervous energy and desperate hope are vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and alignment of actions to his goal. The "fidgety" trait is consistent but could be deepened further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and effectively driven by the ritual, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong, but more cause-and-effect clarity would solidify the arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a resonant question about fragility and renewal. Minor tightening would perfect it.</comment>
