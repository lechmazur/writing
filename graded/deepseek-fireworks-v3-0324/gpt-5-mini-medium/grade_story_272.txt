<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character’s socially awkward inventor trait is vivid and consistent, with motivation sharply defined by regret and a desire to rebuild. The wooden whistle adds depth, revealing his need for small rituals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, with "reaping" as a driving action and logical cause/effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending’s map revelation slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with the diner and encrypted archive blending perfectly. Sensory details (static, neon, coffee) elevate the mood of restless introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (tree of regret) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of rebuilding through reclaimed "forgotten arts" resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding tropes. The wooden whistle and "reversed trails" method feel fresh. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, with minimal cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. Lingers on the reader with its iron-and-rain acceptance, suggesting depth beyond the text.</comment>
