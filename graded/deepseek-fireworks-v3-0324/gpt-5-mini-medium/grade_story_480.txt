<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation and method are unique and well-aligned, but his "indifferent enthusiasm" could be more vividly shown through dialogue or sharper actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven with a clear arc; the receipt and music hall chord elegantly connect beginning to end. Pacing is brisk yet coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant—sodium light, dust motes, and humming alleyways deepen the eerie, liminal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors (receipts as ledgers, comments as bones) and subtext (algorithmic ghosts) elevate this beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Startlingly original voice and concept. Avoids clichés; even "social media exorcist" feels fresh. Nuanced handling of emotion through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story's haunting, open-ended pulse rather than feeling imposed. Lingers provocatively.</comment>
