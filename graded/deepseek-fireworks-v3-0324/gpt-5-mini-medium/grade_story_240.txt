<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The soothsayer’s pragmatism and ambition are sharply defined, with motivations and actions tightly aligned, though his 'lavishly humble' trait feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the soothsayer’s method, though the resolution feels abrupt—more time to explore the village’s split reaction would strengthen the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village and its eerie atmosphere are vividly immersive, with sensory details (hammer strikes, dew gathering) anchoring the world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (hammer as talisman) and subtext (miracles as accountability); the ending lingers with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (weather mapped into brass); avoids clichés, though "dreadful hope" toes the line of melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a resonant whole; the brevity feels intentional, leaving room for interpretation without sacrificing cohesion.</comment>
