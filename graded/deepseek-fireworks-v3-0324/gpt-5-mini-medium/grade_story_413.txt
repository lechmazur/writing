<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The listless noble's motivation is clear and consistent, his naively sophisticated manner adds depth, and his reactions reveal a subtle, ironic self-awareness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, and the rendezvous-driven action feels purposeful. Pacing is deliberate, though the resolution could be slightly more resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The corn maze and pre-sentience era merge hauntingly. Sensory details (smell of the scarf, whispering corn) elevate the atmosphere to near-perfect immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of the scarf, metaphor of wind's "hollow applause") and layered subtext about intention make this linger. The ending is evocative but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clichés. The premise—testing intention in a pre-will world—is ingenious, and the prose avoids purple excess while remaining vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. The elements serve the story’s philosophical core, leaving a haunting question about agency and consequence.</comment>
