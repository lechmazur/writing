<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is deeply woven into the narrative, revealing layers of complexity through his rituals and reactions. His 'hateful adoration' of the chopsticks is a compelling paradox, but his inner voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the character's methodical actions, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. The pacing is deliberate but never sluggish, though the ending could resonate more sharply.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The submarine setting is masterfully evoked through sensory details—fluorescent hums, hull sighs, and kelp mosaics. The atmosphere amplifies the story's themes of isolation and latent meaning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor and subtext, the story lingers in the mind. The cookbook's instructions and the chopsticks' symbolism are particularly striking, though the emotional peaks occasionally feel overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh imagery ("let ruin become grammar") and a voice that avoids cliché. The only flaw is a slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting narrative where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional, though a touch more closure might elevate it further.</comment>
