<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar's duality in habits and motivation is compelling, though his "doubly singular" aspect could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot's coherence is strong, but the temporal framing ("waiting room once good news arrives") feels slightly disjointed from the lighthouse focus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, but the ending’s "practical plan" feels abrupt—more lingering resonance would elevate it.</comment>
