<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iren's motivations and personality are vividly portrayed, blending intelligence and folly. His actions align with his goal of cosmic balance, and his shapeshifting serves as both a tool and a metaphor for his experimental nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The taxi ride and cave resonance converge into a cohesive, purposeful climax. Pacing is brisk but deliberate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and post-imperial decay are richly atmospheric, with sensory details (humming figurine, rain-threaded acoustics) deepening immersion. The setting actively shapes the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (figurine as "secret map"), layered subtext (power as "eccentric tuning"), and evocative prose. The ending is both abrupt and satisfying, leaving room for reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. The "intelligently foolish" premise and figurative language feel fresh. Nuanced emotional resonance, not just stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, and the lingering theme of cosmic reordering lingers.</comment>
