<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jester’s melancholy and motivation are vividly rendered, but his "iconically unintentional" actions could be more explicitly tied to his emotional state.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses organically, though the tea-leaf method feels slightly contrived. Resolution is satisfying but hinges heavily on the captain’s nod.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine is richly evoked; sensory details (oil, ink, ticking gears) deepen the atmosphere. Primer drying as a timeframe is inventive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong subtext about ritual vs. pragmatism, but the tea-leaf analysis veers toward whimsy over depth. Ending lingers elegantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "smile that had learned the vocabulary of crooked hope"). Avoids clichés but leans hard on the jester archetype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the tea leaves and "command" feel less integrated than the drawing or submarine. Length feels deliberate.</comment>
