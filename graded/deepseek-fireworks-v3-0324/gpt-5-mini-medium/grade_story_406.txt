<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coy spy's motivations are clear and her actions reveal a complex, morally ambiguous character. Her "borrowed valor" and diabolical benevolence make her intriguingly layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reversed-time method is inventive and drives the plot cohesively. The story achieves a full arc with tight pacing, though the climax could be slightly sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The brewery is vividly rendered, its inverted cathedral imagery enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (rue, steam) deepen immersion and align with the spy's mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich in subtext—masks, mended fences as moral architecture. Literary devices (metaphors like "ribbon of time") elevate the prose. The ending lingers with quiet satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Remarkably original, avoiding tropes. The reversed-time mechanic and "diabolically benevolent" duality feel fresh. Nuanced emotions (e.g., guilt-trading) avoid AI-generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity serves the story’s precision. Leaves the reader pondering disguise as both theft and repair.</comment>
