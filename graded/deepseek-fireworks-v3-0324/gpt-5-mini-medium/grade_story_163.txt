<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The heiress’s bitter optimism is vividly portrayed, driving her reckless precision. Her grief and curiosity are clear motivators, though her backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, with the detour and unification arc feeling organic. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution could linger a touch longer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The xenobiology station and migrating clouds create a mesmerizing, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing fungi, folding corridors) are immersive and original.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich with literary devices (the stub as talisman, fragmented reality as garment seams). The ending is hauntingly purposeful, though the theme of unification could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original—no clichés, fresh metaphors (time as a "broken instrument"), and nuanced emotion. The prose avoids florid excess while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere brilliantly. The length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with layered depth. A standout piece with minor room for sharper thematic echoes.</comment>
