<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris's motivation and personality are vividly rendered, aligning well with her actions and the story's tone. Her academic artistry and shame-driven resolve are compelling, though her herbalist trait feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat elliptical; the connection between coral restoration and letters could be tighter. Pacing is strong, though the resolution leans subtle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisite—salt, seaweed, and fluorescent hums immerse the reader. The station and wall are evocatively tied to Maris's emotional landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Richly layered prose with potent metaphors ("heart of doubt nibbling courage"). Emotional resonance is high, though the ending's ambiguity may polarize.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice with fresh imagery (e.g., "ink faded to a blue like deep water"). Minimal cliché, though "breathless longing" edges toward familiar lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the sewing kit and letters elevate the theme. The word limit feels intentional, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
