<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bleak clown's motivations and contradictions (grin vs. bleakness, generosity vs. jaggedness) are vividly drawn, but some thematic density occasionally overshadows clarity in his immediate actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic coheres around the clock hand and fissure, but the resolution feels abrupt—more symbolic than earned. Pacing is uneven in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere: graphite air, burned toast, and the floating rock create a haunting, sensory-rich world that amplifies the clown's struggles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent metaphors (grin as coronation, riverbed hands). Some abstractions risk pretension, but the emotional core lands.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Startling originality in voice and imagery (e.g., "serrated halo"). Minimal cliché, though "drifting promises" borders on overused poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious vignette. The constraints feel generative, not limiting. Lingers like a half-remembered dream.</comment>
