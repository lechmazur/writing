<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wayfarer's restless nature and quiet curiosity are well-drawn, but his "unbelievably ordinary" cadence feels underutilized in contrast to his mystical quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot's dreamlike progression is cohesive, though the rift's emergence could benefit from slightly clearer cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphereâ€”the abandoned theatre and dimensional rift are rendered with evocative, layered sensory details that deepen the story's mythic quality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical and metaphorical without excess, with a haunting ending. Some symbols (red thread, paper crane) could resonate more deeply with tighter thematic stitching.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Refreshingly original voice and perspective, though a few phrases ("hollow patience in the floor") edge toward over-poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A nearly flawless fusion of elements, leaving a lingering metaphysical weight. The brevity feels intentional, but the climax could linger slightly longer.</comment>
