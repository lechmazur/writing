<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The knight’s clever naivety and stubborn heart are vividly portrayed, and his motivation is clear and consistent with his hopeful but determined nature. The use of the jigsaw edge as a talisman subtly reveals his blend of practicality and emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with a clear arc (quest, discovery, resolution) despite the brevity. The method of syncing frequencies is inventive and logically integrated. Pacing is excellent, with no rushed or dragged moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and flickering streetlamp create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere. Sensory details (crushed quince, static, humming jigsaw) are evocative and deepen immersion. The setting and object are meaningfully intertwined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich in subtext and symbolism (e.g., the machine as cyclical grief, the jigsaw as fragmented hope). The ending is poignant and purposeful, with emotional resonance. Literary devices like metaphor ("shadows held stories like unpicked fruit") are fresh and impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and free of clichés. The handling of "agonizing bliss" is nuanced, and the prose avoids purple tendencies while remaining vivid. The knight’s emotional duality feels authentically human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically dense story where every element serves the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy. Creative recombination of elements (e.g., frequencies + jigsaw tuning) elevates it beyond tropes.</comment>
