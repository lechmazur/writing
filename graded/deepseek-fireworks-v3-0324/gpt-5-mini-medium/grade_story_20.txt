<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the bridge of regret serving as a natural pivot. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial imagery create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that amplifies the story's themes. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich with subtext and literary devices (e.g., the comb as metaphor). The ending lingers, and the style elevates the narrative. Themes of regret and record-keeping resonate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The "passionate disinterest" tone is fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "calcified into a cool obsession") are striking. No AI-generated flatness.</comment>
