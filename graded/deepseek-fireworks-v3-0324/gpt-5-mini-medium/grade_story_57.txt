<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Edmund's paradox of submission and bravery is compelling; his motivation to protect the nightjar is clear and consistent with his aristocratic, perceptive nature. His voice is distinct, blending flippancy with depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the connection between the letter opener and the nest is elegant, though the word limit constrains fuller development of cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vivid and purposeful, blending sensory details (solder, motor oil) with thematic resonance. The setting enhances Edmund's actions and contrasts with his aristocratic refinement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext ("liquify fear") and layered metaphors (letter opener as talisman) elevate the storytelling. The ending is satisfying, though some transitions feel abrupt due to brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh, specific metaphors and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©. The aristocrat-agent juxtaposition is original, though the "earnest flippancy" tone occasionally feels strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere impressively despite complexity. The story lingers via Edmund's quiet heroism, though the workshop's role could be sharper.</comment>
