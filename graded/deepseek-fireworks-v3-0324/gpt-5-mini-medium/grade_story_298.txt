<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The chameleon actor's dual nature is vividly rendered, with his methodical yet impulsive approach to performance revealing deep layers of emotional and historical excavation. His motivation—blending honesty into artifice—is clear and compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with forensic precision, linking discoveries (like the doll’s dress) to emotional revelations. The tight word count is masterfully used, though the climax could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The palace’s decaying grandeur is evoked through exquisite sensory details (oil lamps, metallic corridors). The atmosphere of "anxious serenity" permeates every scene, enhancing the story’s melancholic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors (sunlight as "a patient question") and layered subtext (performance as justice) elevate the narrative. The ending lingers, questioning how history mourns.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Startlingly original—no clichés here. The chameleon’s forensic artistry and the palace’s reimagined labyrinth feel wholly unique. Nuanced emotions are shown, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A near-flawless fusion of elements. The brief length feels deliberate, each word purposeful. The story’s meditation on truth and illusion resonates beyond its final line.</comment>
