<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gambler's motivation is clear and consistent, with distinct voice and nuanced reactions to the botanical diary, though his shift from sentimentality to cruelty could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a strong arc from despair to redemption. The spin-the-bottle mechanic feels slightly contrived but ultimately serves the theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the ghost town and schoolhouse are vividly rendered, with sensory details (chalk ghosts, swing chains) that deepen the melancholic yet whimsical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (diary as ledger, green sprout as hope) and layered subtext about power and mercy. The ending is poignant but risks being overly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original and fresh metaphors (e.g., "pressed hopes," "policy of memory"). Minimal clich√©, though the gambler archetype edges close to trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering meditation on fragility of authority.</comment>
