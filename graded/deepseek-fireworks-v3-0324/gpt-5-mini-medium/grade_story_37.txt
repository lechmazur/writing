<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and nuanced, revealing depth through her past and present actions. The "dishonestly honest" attribute is particularly compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot's structure is coherent, but the rainforest village detour slightly disrupts momentum. Pacing is well-managed within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked—sensory details like the eucalyptus-scented sheet music and the waiting room's silence deepen immersion. The rainforest village feels slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (sheet music as a "ticket from her past") and a memorable, thematic ending. Subtext about redemption elevates the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors avoid clichés. The yodel and "dishonestly honest" grin add quirky authenticity. Minor over-reliance on whimsy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the rainforest detour feels less integrated. Leaves a lingering reflection on reinvention.</comment>
