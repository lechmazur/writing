<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stoic wanderer's motivation is compelling and consistent, though his "mesmerizingly bland" demeanor could be more vividly contrasted with his internal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive but slightly rushed; the trail of nightmares could be more explicitly tied to the climax. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (iron, animal sleep) and symbolic dummies enhancing the witchy setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "wooden dummies curl like question marks"); avoids cliché while maintaining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements harmonize flawlessly; the floorboard and "brash tenderness" feel organic, not forced. Leaves a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
