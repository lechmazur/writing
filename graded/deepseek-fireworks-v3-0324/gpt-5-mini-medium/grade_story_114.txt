<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apathetic summoner's "enthusiastically lazy" attribute is compelling and consistent, shaping his ritualistic actions and unique approach to rebuilding coral reefs. His distinct voice and motivation are subtly revealed through his unconventional methods.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds organically with a clear arc, leveraging the "matching empty frames" method to drive the narrative. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive, and cause-and-effect logic is upheld despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The shared dream studio and post-god-death atmosphere are richly evoked through sensory details (coffee grinder, braided light, lacquer discs). The setting and object enhance both mood and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of literary devices (river wisdom as metaphor, coral reefs as symbolism) and subtext (apology for divine silence). The ending lingers with poetic resonance, and the theme of reconstruction through absence is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original and avoids tropes. Metaphors ("gentle sharpness," "powdered coral") are fresh, and the style balances lyrical precision with emotional nuance. No AI-generic phrasing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich microcosm. Elements serve the story flawlessly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves the reader with haunting questions about legacy and silence.</comment>
