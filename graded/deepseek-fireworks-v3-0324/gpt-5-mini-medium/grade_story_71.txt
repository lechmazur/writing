<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The scarecrow's paradoxical fervent apathy is compelling and consistent, but deeper exploration of his past or the oath's origin would strengthen motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s dreamlike logic and seamless integration of virtual/physical trespassers create cohesion, though the skewering incident feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—fossilized giant as cathedral/courtroom, dust-data storms—elevates the story beyond its word limit. Sensory details are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich subtext (memory vs. mourning machinery) and striking metaphors ("legal documents of the soil"). Ending lingers but risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery (e.g., "ritual knot than memory"). No clichés; only minor strain in VR integration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole. The brevity feels intentional, though the fan’s backstory begs expansion.</comment>
