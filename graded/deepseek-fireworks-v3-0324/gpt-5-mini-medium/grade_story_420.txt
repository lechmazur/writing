<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with the themes of failure, transformation, and artistic rebirth. His actions and emotional state reveal a nuanced character, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from struggle to revelation. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the cause-and-effect logic (ring + fossil = breakthrough) is compelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fossil-field setting is vividly rendered and essential to the story's mood. Sensory details (texture of bark, bending light) immerse the reader and elevate the emotional weight of the sculptor's epiphany.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship: metaphors ("imploding shame"), symbolism (ring as failure/renewal), and subtext (artistic paralysis vs. rebirth) are masterfully woven. The ending resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s. The fusion of concepts (light, fossils, puzzles) feels fresh. Nuanced emotions ("excited boredom") and stylistic precision elevate it above generic prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story where all elements serve a unified vision. The brief length feels deliberate; the lingering impact suggests rare depth for such constrained wordcount.</comment>
