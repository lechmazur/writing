<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and their actions are consistently aligned with their traits. The 'brainy observer' attribute shapes their personality well, though their distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though some cause-and-effect relationships could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The bioluminescent bay enhances the story’s mood, though the FTL element feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, and the story evokes thought. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict could be more pronounced. Theme of fragility-as-strength is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and feels original, with fresh metaphors. However, some phrases edge toward flowery, and the emotional nuance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creative, with elements serving the narrative. The length works, but the FTL aspect feels slightly tacked-on rather than integral. Leaves a lingering thought.</comment>
