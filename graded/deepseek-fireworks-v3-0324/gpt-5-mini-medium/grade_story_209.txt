<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cal's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his method and object, but his woodsman background feels underutilized in favor of his mapping obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly fragmented by the abrupt shifts between hospital beeps, radio waves, and rail mapping. Pacing is tight but occasionally jarring.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and abandoned railways create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (echoes, coal dust) are vividly immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (hairbrush, echoes) and layered themes (honesty, ruin) elevate the story. The ending is poignant but could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh despite some familiar tropes (dying confessions, buried pasts). The hairbrush ritual and echo method are standout innovations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unique whole, though the woodsman premise feels slightly forced. The brevity serves the storyâ€™s melancholic tone well.</comment>
