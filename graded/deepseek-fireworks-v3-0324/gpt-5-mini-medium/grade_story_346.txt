<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The boastful warrior's motivation is clear and consistent, with his rehearsed bravado revealing a desperate need to escape fabricated reality. His interactions with the lint-filled pocket and wasps deepen his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the warrior's rewiring of perception driving the narrative. The ending's resolution feels earned, though the word limit slightly rushes the final revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The wasp nest's pulsating, surreal atmosphere is masterfully rendered. Sensory details (wax, balloon pops, humming) amplify the dissonance between fabrication and truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lint as fragmented identity, wasps as doubt) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending’s thematic payoff—confessing the "theft" of borrowed narratives—resonates deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original. The juxtaposition of "precise madness" and the warrior's performative decay avoids clichés. The lint-as-map metaphor is startlingly fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting exploration of self-deception. The brief length feels intentional, leaving the reader unsettled by the warrior's fragile grasp on truth.</comment>
