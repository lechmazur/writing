<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply tied to the cipher and grandmother's legacy; his method of investigation reveals his obsessive, hopeful nature. Voice is distinct, though slightly more internal monologue could enhance depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven; chain-reactive coincidences drive the narrative organically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, with a satisfying arc from mystery to resolution. Minor leap at the watchtowers could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional—suburban mundanity contrasts strikingly with the mythic watchtowers and tar pit. Sensory details (oil-smell horizons, butterfly's unfurling) immerse the reader fully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (butterfly, gear-like names) and subtext (alchemy as care). Ending resonates emotionally and thematically. Prose is poetic but precise, amplifying impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original—kinship webs as alchemy subverts tropes. Fresh metaphors ("living braids," "gears of names"). No clichés; emotions are shown through layered imagery and action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly; brief length feels intentional. Lingers on the reader with its meditation on lineage and ritual. Only a hair’s breadth from flawless.</comment>
