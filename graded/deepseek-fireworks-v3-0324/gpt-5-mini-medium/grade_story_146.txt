<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation—studying sacred development—is clear and consistently drives their actions. Their transition from faux fortune teller to language steward is compelling, though some nuances of their "peaceful anger" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the bone flute and archive discoveries driving a logical arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the rooftop garden scene feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>World-building is exceptional, with the extinct language archive and canal setting steeped in evocative sensory details. The atmosphere enhances both the character's journey and the story’s mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the flute’s "different grammar") are used masterfully. The theme of buried tongues and revival resonates deeply, though the ending could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors and no clichés. The handling of "peaceful anger" and the bone flute’s role avoid predictability, though "regularly seldom" feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, with the lexicon and flute serving the story’s core. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting, thought-provoking impression.</comment>
