<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivor's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with his background, with his actions and "sweetly fierce" devotion revealing a nuanced, layered character. The fan serves as both a prop and a symbolic link to his ancestry, enriching his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Ivor's mediation efforts driving the narrative. The connection between his struggle and the park's survival is coherent, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground fairy city is vividly rendered through bioluminescent details and sensory immersion. The setting enhances the story's mythic tone and supports Ivor's thematic conflict with genetic limitations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors (fire as lineage), symbolism (the fan), and subtext (ancestral therapy) elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of genetics, performance, and fairy lore feels fresh. Nuanced emotions and stylistic precision avoid AI-generated telltales.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive narrative where all elements serve the story. The brevity feels intentional, and the thematic depth lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
