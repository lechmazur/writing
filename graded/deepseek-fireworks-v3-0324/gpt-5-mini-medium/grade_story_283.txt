<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with his eccentric yet scientific approach. His use of the whip and response to radio frequencies reveal a layered personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot feels coherent and purposeful, with the radio orders and soil study creating a subtle arc. Pacing is tight but not rushed, though the giant's shoe setting could be more naturally woven in.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (leather, static, soil), but the giant's shoe feels slightly incongruous despite its poetic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—subtext, symbolism (soil as memory), and a hauntingly unique voice. The ending lingers with quiet satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clichés. The whip's repurposing and "apathetic eagerness" are fresh, though the giant's shoe leans slightly gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story’s quiet depth. Leaves the reader pondering the intersection of science and solitude.</comment>
