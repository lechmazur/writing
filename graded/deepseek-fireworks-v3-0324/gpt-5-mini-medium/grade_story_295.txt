<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin's jovial yet reluctant nature is vividly portrayed, and his motivation—rooted in family tradition and personal fear—feels consistent. The telescope and vow deepen his complexity, though his transition could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The tight word limit forces some compression, but the arc from vow to resolution feels complete, if slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The witch's garden is lushly rendered, blending sensory details (violet basil, silvery soil) with atmospheric magic. The setting amplifies Corin's internal struggle and the story's themes beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars as letters, roots as secrets) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending satisfies, though the emotional resonance could delve deeper in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The telescope's role and the "elegant mayhem" tone stand out, though a few phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive blend of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. Only minor tightening would make it flawless.</comment>
