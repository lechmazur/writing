<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer's dual motivation (justice and garden restoration) is intriguing, but his "joyful terror" could be more deeply explored to fully crystallize his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot's arc is tight and purposeful, with the reversed messages and glass butterfly elegantly threading the narrative. Minor pacing hiccups near the council scene.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion—singed moss, maple-ribbed vaults—and the underground setting amplifies the story’s thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly as confession/accusation) and layered subtext (justice as compost-like transformation) elevate the prose. Ending lingers beautifully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("hope felt like a blade and a blossom") avoid cliché, though the "reversed messages" device borders on over-engineered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant tale where elements serve the story’s depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for the reader’s imagination.</comment>
