<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is vivid and consistent; his confusion and rebellion against fate are compelling. The abacus and jogging ritual deepen his complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven around the priest's reckoning with complacency. Pacing is deliberate, and cause-effect logic is clear despite surreal setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard's eerie atmosphere is masterfully evoked. Dull radiance and snow patterns enhance thematic tension. Setting feels alive and punitive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (abacus, vines) and layered subtext elevate the prose. Ending resonates with quiet defiance. Every device serves the story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s. Metaphors (e.g., "heart like a fist trying to be a hand") are fresh. Nuanced emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere brilliantly. Length feels intentional; themes of choice and fate linger. A standout literary vignette.</comment>
