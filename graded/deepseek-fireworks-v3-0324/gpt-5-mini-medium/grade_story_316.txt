<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The seamstress's timid yet luminous nature is vividly portrayed, and her childhood promise drives her actions consistently. However, her "voice" could be more distinct beyond her quiet demeanor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the scoreboard serving as a clever mechanism for tracking collective healing. The arc feels complete, though the temple's role could be more integral to the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The reimagined temple and arcade create a hauntingly poetic atmosphere. Sensory details (neon votives, faded murals) are masterfully deployed, though the factory whistle's auditory impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (quilt as communal anchor, inkless keys as silent vows) elevates the narrative. The ending is poignant, though the seamstress's internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, avoiding clich√©s. The metaphor of "scattered harmony" is fresh, though the seamstress's timidity occasionally verges on trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting fable. The elements serve the story elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of collective repair.</comment>
