<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The penitent memory thief's motivation is clear and nuanced, with his actions revealing a complex blend of regret and determination. His "lovingly hateful" touch adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and well-paced, with the recalibration method logically driving the narrative. The crack's resolution feels earned but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fruit preservation vault and its atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (frost, vinegar, tea) enriching the world. The swing-set motif ties in elegantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (petals, block) and layered subtext (guilt, restitution). The ending is resonant, though the vault keeper's role could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors ("orchard bones") and no clich√©s. The "icy warmth" tone is distinct, though a few phrases verge on over-polished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
