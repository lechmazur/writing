<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The druid's ambivalence and fear are vividly portrayed, shaping his actions and voice with precision. His motivation is clear and deeply integrated into the ritual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the meal ritual driving the narrative toward a satisfying resolution. Pacing is deliberate but never sluggish, and the cause-effect logic is seamless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The glacial orchard and crevasse setting is exquisitely rendered, with sensory details (frost, ice apples, lichens) amplifying the atmosphere. The world feels alive and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Literary craft is exceptional—symbolism (safety pin, echo), subtext (silence as terror), and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending lingers with emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, avoiding clichés. The druid’s nuanced emotions and fresh metaphors (e.g., "fruit that tasted of bone and hymn") defy AI-generic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. Elements serve the story, not vice versa. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant thematic aftertaste.</comment>
