<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The farmer's motivation and actions are deeply intertwined with his environment and history, creating a compelling and distinct voice. His "typically atypical" nature is subtly but effectively conveyed through his rituals and interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. The connection between the farmer's initial isolation and final rebellion is satisfying but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war atmosphere are richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the haunting, liminal mood. The setting actively shapes the story's tension and themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the magician's deck as a metaphor for fate) are masterfully deployed. The ending resonates, though the thematic depth occasionally overshadows narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh metaphors ("song of boundaries") and subversions of tropes. The prose avoids clich√© and feels deeply human, though a few phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, though some thematic layers could benefit from more space. Lingers in the mind.</comment>
