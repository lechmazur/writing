<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The minstrel's motivation is clear and beautifully aligned with his actions, but his "openly private" attribute could be more consistently woven into his behavior beyond surface gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from longing to decisive action. The meteorite ritual is inventive but slightly abrupt in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—sensory details (burnt toast, meteorite texture) deepen the setting. The giant's dining room is underutilized as more than backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptional craft: metaphors ("braiding time") and subtext elevate the story. The ending resonates with quiet power, though the ladle's significance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh imagery avoid clichés. Nuanced emotions ("a hiccup in his newly emplaced pulse") showcase authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and lyrical, with elements serving the story’s heart. The brevity feels deliberate, though the giant's world could be more integrated.</comment>
