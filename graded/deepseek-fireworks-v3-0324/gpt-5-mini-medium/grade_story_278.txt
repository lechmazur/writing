<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivation is clear and deeply integrated into his actions, though his 'brooding' nature could be more vividly shown through interactions or internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on poetic abstraction, which slightly obscures cause-and-effect logic. The disappearance feels both spontaneous and rehearsed, a paradox that isn't fully resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with comet dust, soap suds, and motes of light creating a tactile, immersive world. The base's intrigue, however, remains slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking literary craftâ€”metaphors ("filaments of complicity," "fossilized contract") and symbolism (glasses as sacrament) elevate the prose. The ending is haunting but could resonate deeper with tighter thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though some phrases ("murky tenderness") verge on overwrought. The dust-disappearance method is fresh, but the intrigue theme feels somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically assured, with elements woven elegantly. The brevity suits the tale's meditative quality, though the "webs of intrigue" strand feels less essential.</comment>
