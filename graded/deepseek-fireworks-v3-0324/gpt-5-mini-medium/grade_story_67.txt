<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blacksmith's jovial yet precariously confident demeanor is vividly portrayed, and his motivation to tame darkness is compellingly aligned with his craft. However, his "fervent indifference" could be more deeply explored to avoid slight tonal inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the metronome and departing train framing the blacksmith's endurance test. The arc feels complete, though the attic's role in the climax could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is stellar—oily, bookish attic and ticking inventions create a hauntingly tactile world. The train's fleeting presence amplifies the urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful craft: light-as-talisman symbolism, layered metaphors (iron temperament/bellows), and a subdued yet resonant ending. Only minor nit: the earring's rainbows verge on whimsy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional originality—no tropes, fresh metaphors ("invention as stubborn prayer"), and nuanced emotion. The "fervent indifference" phrasing risks slight pretension but mostly lands.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting vignette. The elements serve the story, and the brevity feels deliberate. Lingers like the coal dust clinging to memory.</comment>
