<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is both clear and deeply intertwined with his unique role, revealing layers of his past and present through subtle actions and symbolic objects like the washer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the midnight calls and refashioning of identities driving a coherent, haunting arc. Pacing is impeccable for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cloud city is vividly atmospheric, its vapor-and-brass aesthetic enhancing the story's themes of transience and hidden structures. Sensory details (e.g., the washer's light) are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional craft—symbolism (washer as moon), layered subtext (identity as scaffold), and a resonant ending. The prose is poetic yet precise, elevating the story beyond its premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original, avoiding clichés. The scapegoat’s role and cloud city feel fresh, and metaphors (e.g., "tuning the sky") are inventive. Emotional depth is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking vignette. Elements serve the story’s themes seamlessly, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
