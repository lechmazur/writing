<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener's quiet persistence and introspection are vividly portrayed, but their motivation, while clear, could be more deeply integrated into their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot drifts poetically but lacks tight cause-and-effect cohesion; the flicker of recognition is a highlight, but some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is hauntingly evocative, with sensory details (bird calls, embroidery, silence) enriching the world, though the center's purpose could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent metaphors (e.g., "pocketwatch of moments"), but the ending's wordless resolution risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh and original, avoiding clich√©s; the gardener's nuanced longing and the purse's symbolism elevate the narrative beyond formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving its poetic core, though the silent retreat detracts slightly from momentum.</comment>
