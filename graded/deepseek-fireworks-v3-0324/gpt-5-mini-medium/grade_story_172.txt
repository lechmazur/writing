<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is intriguingly complex, though his "accidentally heroic" nature feels slightly underdeveloped. His relationship with the puzzle box and prophecy is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but occasionally dense; the reversed-wishes method adds uniqueness, though pacing stumbles in explaining its mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting—the seashell and beach meld beautifully with architectural secrets, though the hallway intro feels disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Richly layered symbolism ("salt," "seed," "congregants") elevates the prose. Ending resonates, though prophecy's acceleration feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and lyrical, but "sharp gentleness" tone wavers. Avoids clichés, though some metaphors (e.g., "heartbeat architecture") strain.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements. Leaves a lingering question: is defiance of fate heroic or futile? Word limit feels deliberate.</comment>
