<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reaper's heartbreak and shifting motivation are vividly portrayed, with clear alignment between his emotional state and actions. His 'voice' is distinct, though slightly more internal dialogue could deepen nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot's arc is coherent and purposeful within the word limit, though the transition from reaping to mapping feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, but cause-and-effect could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cave library is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (stalactites chiming, pages sighing) elevating the mood. The setting amplifies the reaper's isolation and quest beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (e.g., "fragile rib," "rain drums in his chest") and subtext. The ending resonates, though the conflict between duty and healing could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, with fresh imagery and nuanced emotion. Avoids clichés, and the reaper's duality ("fearful joy") feels authentically human. No signs of formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly integrated, and the brevity enhances the story’s mythic quality. Leaves a haunting, lingering impression of renewal and connection.</comment>
