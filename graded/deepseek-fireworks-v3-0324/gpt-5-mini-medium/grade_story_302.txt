<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard's motivation ("to kiss the horizon of madness") is vividly clear and drives his actions with consistency. His fiercely nonchalant attitude and distinct voice elevate the character beyond a trope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and purposeful, with the manuscript’s ritual anchoring the arc. Pacing is tight, though the resolution’s sudden calm feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Steampunk airship atmosphere is immersive, with gaslight, brass engines, and sensory details (smoke, orange peel) enriching the chaos-taming ritual’s mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative literary devices (symbolism of the manuscript, sparks as punctuation) and a layered theme—madness as cartography—create lasting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "syllables flung like ballast"). Avoids clichés, with nuanced emotion and subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively; the story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant question about chaos and communal defiance.</comment>
