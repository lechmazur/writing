<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong, nuanced character development; motivation is clear and deeply interwoven with her traits and the prophecy. Her linguistic ineptness contrasts beautifully with her physical expressiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight, elegant structure with a clear arc. The twist (confession vs. triumph) resolves the prophecy organically, and pacing balances introspection with momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere; the chamber’s antiseptic-citrus smell and holographic family traces create a haunting, immersive world that amplifies the theme of eroded memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful storytelling with layered symbolism (patch as talisman, steam as blurred truth). Ending resonates emotionally and thematically, leaving room for ambivalence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original and authentic. Fresh metaphors ("lead apron of denial") and avoided clichés. Voice is distinct, and emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story’s depth, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers in the mind due to its thematic richness.</comment>
