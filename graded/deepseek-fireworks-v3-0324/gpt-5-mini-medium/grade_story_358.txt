<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mage's motivation is exquisitely layered—sanctified dread, filial care, and ruthless frontier-claiming intertwine seamlessly. His voice is distinct, his rituals purposeful yet enigmatic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot unfolds like the riddle itself—fragmented yet deliberate. Pacing is masterful, with the fragment’s revelation mirroring the mage’s gradual occupation of the frontier. Resolution is hauntingly unresolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Defies tropes with its icy mysticism. "Sanctified dread" and mirror-doubled children feel uniquely unsettling. Language is ornate but precise—no purple prose.</comment>
