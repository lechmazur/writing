<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong character development, but motivations could be more sharply defined. Nomad's transformation is compelling but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolism at the expense of grounded cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight but somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere with rich sensory details. The disguise room and barbells are deeply integrated into the mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor and subtext. Ending is satisfying, though the dialogue (implied in nods and silence) could be more textured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, but some phrases verge on overwrought. Avoids clich√©s, though the "broken barbells as humility" metaphor is slightly heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious for its length. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of ambition, but the brevity slightly undermines depth.</comment>
