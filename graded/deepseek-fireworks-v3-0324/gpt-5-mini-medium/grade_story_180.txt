<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's remorse and peculiar method (knitting needle, fingerprint matching) are vividly portrayed, but his "indifferent enthusiasm" could be more deeply explored to align with his motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive but leans heavily on atmospheric vignettes; the connection between yard sales and the greenhouse feels tenuous, lacking a strong cause-effect chain.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details (drowned citrus, salt light) and the haunting setting elevate the atmosphere, though the shipwrecks could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (microscope as time-stitching) and layered subtext ("shared wisdom") compensate for a slightly opaque central conflict. The ending lingers but isn't fully resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "stitch time") avoid clich√©. Only minor quibble: "obviously mysterious" feels slightly overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, stylistically daring experiment. The brevity serves the theme, but some elements (yard sales) feel underutilized for the story's ambitions.</comment>
