<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and thematically rich, but the 'spineless' trait feels underdeveloped in action. The leader's voice is distinct yet lacks deeper interaction with others.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and thematically driven, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. The ending resonates, though the middle could use more tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully evoked—sensory details (rain, glass, pollen) elevate the setting. The greenhouse city and toxic sky are symbiotic with the story's grief-bloom duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical and layered, with potent symbolism (tears as syntax, owl as talisman). Emotional impact is strong, though some metaphors verge on overworked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and haunting, but occasional phrases ("statically dynamic") feel repetitive. Nuanced handling of sorrow, though the cult leader's passivity edges toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly; the length feels intentional. Lingering questions about ecology and grief linger, though the leader's influence could be sharper.</comment>
