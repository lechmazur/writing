<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sentinel's faintheartedness and motivation to learn ancient writings are clear, but his "intimately distant" nature feels somewhat abstract. His use of the ruler as a crutch reveals his character well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The "drift" action is effective, though the tapestry method could be more structurally pivotal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The contrast between the mundane dog-walking and the secret society's atmosphere is evocative and immersive. Sensory details (low light, knots, bark) enrich the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ruler, tapestry) and subtext about security. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors ("boat without an anchor") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids tropes, though the "illusion of security" theme is somewhat overstated. The ruler’s role feels fresh, but the elder's intervention is predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the chamber’s purpose could be sharper.</comment>
