<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twin's motivation is clear but their actions with actors feel contrived. The mark on the wrist is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but the farmers market intro feels disconnected from the mountain climax. Pacing is tight but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid, especially the mountain and cave, but the farmers market setting lacks depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the farmers market feels tacked on. Storyâ€™s brevity works, though some beats need fleshing out.</comment>
