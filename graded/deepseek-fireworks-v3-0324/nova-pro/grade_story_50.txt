<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear but his "capriciously consistent" attribute feels underdeveloped. His faith wavering is compelling, but the fork's symbolic weight isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's quest, though the piano's role feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, but the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass desert and butterfly migration create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (crunching glass, kaleidoscope wings) are exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fork, piano) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, but the theme of "tested faith" could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in premise, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("fleeting beauty," "shimmering shards"). Emotional nuance is strong, though the piano's magic feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the fork and faith connection lacks depth. The brevity works, leaving a lingering, if slightly vague, impression.</comment>
