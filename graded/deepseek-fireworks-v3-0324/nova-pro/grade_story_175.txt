<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The aged minstrel's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'feral elegance' feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his goal of sharing forbidden knowledge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of completeness, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between the birdcage and the village's past could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mushroom village's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the story's mood. The setting and object (birdcage) are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (birdcage, chipped paint) and a memorable theme of lost magic. The ending is purposeful, though the storytelling could delve deeper into emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (wise old storyteller, forbidden knowledge). Some phrases feel overly ornate, though the tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate in its brevity. Elements serve the narrative well, but the minstrel's method (comparing chipped paint) feels forced.</comment>
