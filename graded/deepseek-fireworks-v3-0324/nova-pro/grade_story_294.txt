<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bard's motivation is clear but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt. His "dry-tongued" trait is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the voicemail device strains believability. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent fungi and prism create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong but slightly overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (prism, cloak) is effective, but the emotional payoff leans on clichés. Ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution feels AI-assisted—some phrases ("gorgeously awkward") ring hollow. Nuance is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story leans too heavily on its whimsical setting to mask thematic thinness.</comment>
