<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "warmly aloof" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her passion for time is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed, especially the time-travel resolution. The dial tone moment is abrupt, disrupting pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cargo hold and chalk create a vivid contrast, but the pirate crew's lack of presence weakens the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by the word limit. Lacks lingering depth.</comment>
