<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elion's motivation is clear but his romantic doom feels underdeveloped. The keys and bell connection is strong, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed. The bell's impact on designers feels abrupt. Pacing struggles in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, especially the tower and bell. Studio setting is underutilized despite vivid descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism, but emotional resonance is uneven. Ending is purposeful but lacks depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some feel forced (e.g., "utopia design studio"). Story lingers but lacks true depth.</comment>
