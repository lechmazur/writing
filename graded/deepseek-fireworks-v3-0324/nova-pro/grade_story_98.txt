<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's fainthearted nature and motivation are clear, but his transformation lacks depth. The ruler's use is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly rushed. The tapestry's shifting patterns are a strong driver, but the dog-walking contrast is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chamber's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with rich sensory details. The tapestries enhance the mood, though the timeframe clash weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext are present but could be sharper. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance is muted by telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (secret society, ancient wisdom). Some phrases feel overly formal, and the ruler's significance isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but leans too heavily on assigned elements. The brevity works, but the theme lacks lingering impact.</comment>
