<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his connection to the seashells adds depth, but his "scrappy tavern-hand" background feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surrealism; the randomness of footprints works, but the arc feels incomplete due to the open-ended resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are creatively combined, but the story feels constrained by its word limit, leaving some ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
