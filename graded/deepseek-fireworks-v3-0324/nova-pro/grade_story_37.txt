<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but his "dishonestly honest" attribute feels underdeveloped. His past as a con artist is mentioned but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the detour and yodel feel abrupt. The connection between Finn’s past and present could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly rendered, but the waiting room’s blend of modern and traditional feels slightly forced. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (sheet music, flame) works well, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the yodel and setting, but some phrases feel overly polished. The tone wavers between whimsy and earnestness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels slightly constrained by them. The length suits the narrative, but depth is sacrificed.</comment>
