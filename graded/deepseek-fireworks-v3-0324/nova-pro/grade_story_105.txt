<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The outcast scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The seashell's connection to his soul is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ritual's execution is logical, but the restroom diary discovery feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The witch's garage and half-lit corridor create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are evocative, though the garage's role could be expanded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional resonance is occasionally stated rather than shown. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (e.g., hidden diaries, arcane rituals). The prose avoids clich√©s but lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering thought but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
