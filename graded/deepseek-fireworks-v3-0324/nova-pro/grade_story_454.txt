<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jax's reckless nature and rational emotion are clear, but his smuggling background feels underutilized. His motivation for acceptance is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the synchronized watch feels gimmicky. Pacing is tight, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details are strong, but the funhouse mirrors could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (clover, mirrors) is effective, and the ending is satisfying. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Theme of belonging is clear but could be richer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”haunted parks and clovers are tropes, but the tone is fresh. Some phrases feel generic ("jubilant despair").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the smuggler angle feels tacked on. The length suits the story, though deeper thematic exploration is missed.</comment>
