<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her defiance of genetic limitations feels underdeveloped. Her "sweetly fierce" attribute is well-integrated but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the walkie-talkie transmission feels contrived. The arc is satisfying, though the fairy city resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The park's decay and the fairy city's glow are particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (fan, fire) and emotional resonance, but the theme of genetic limitations isn't fully explored. The ending is poignant but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (hidden fairy realm, forgotten magic). Some phrases ("sweetly fierce flame") verge on clich√©. The voice is distinct but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the walkie-talkie and genetic limitations feel forced. The length suits the story, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
