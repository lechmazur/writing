<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orchardist's motivation is clear but his "trustworthy unique" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, but his personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the multiverse leap feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, and the ending resolves neatly, though some transitions lack finesse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underwater city hall is vividly atmospheric, but the multiverse dilutes its impact. Sensory details (phantom hand, leaves) are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (leaves, phantom hand) is effective, and the theme of wisdom resonates. The ending is purposeful, but emotional depth is occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on mystical tropes. Language avoids purple prose, though some metaphors (phantom hand) feel overused. Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite constraints, but the multiverse feels tacked on. Leaves a lingering thought, though the execution lacks polish.</comment>
