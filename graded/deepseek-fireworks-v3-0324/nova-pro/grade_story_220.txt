<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The aloof page's transformation is compelling, but his initial detachment feels underdeveloped. His curiosity and mission are clear, but his "aloof" trait lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but some transitions feel abrupt. The word limit constraints show in rushed pacing during key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth and port city setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere. The "wounded season" adds poetic weight but could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (logbook, labyrinth) and thematic depth, but the emotional resonance is occasionally stated rather than shown. The ending satisfies but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (truth-seekers vs. illusion-keepers). Some phrases feel formulaic ("innovative nostalgia"). The logbook's pulsing life is a standout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story sometimes feels constructed around them. The brevity works, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
