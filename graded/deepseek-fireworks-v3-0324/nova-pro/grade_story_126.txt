<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The merchant's "honestly strange" motivations are intriguing but slightly underdeveloped. His connection to the butter churn and poster is compelling, though his "aloof passion" could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the merchant's ascent, though the method (climbing a poster) strains logic. The arc from despair to rebellion is clear and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile space station contrasts powerfully with the lush poster and rustic churn. Sensory details (flaking paint, worn wood) deepen the atmosphere of loss and defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (poster as illusion, churn as rebellion) and evocative prose. The ending is poignant but slightly abrupt. Theme of breaking limitations resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The butter churn in space is a striking image. Some phrases verge on overly poetic but avoid purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The story feels deliberate, not constrained by length. Leaves a lingering question about human limits.</comment>
