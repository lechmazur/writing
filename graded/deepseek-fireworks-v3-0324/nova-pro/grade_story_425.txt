<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The paladin's morose demeanor and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels abrupt. His "bored excitement" is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the blackout's resolution leans too heavily on convenience. The needle's role is clever but slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory's lavishly austere setting is vivid and atmospheric, but the "last star named" timeframe feels underutilized. Sensory details are strong but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (needle as key) is effective, and the ending resonates. However, the theme of cosmic secrets is stated more than shown. Dialogue absence limits depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (chosen one, ancient systems). Some phrasing feels algorithmic ("bored excitement"). Emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The ending hints at depth but doesn't fully deliver.</comment>
