<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's morose demeanor and emotional weight are clear, but his motivation ("resurrecting home") feels abstract and lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the anvil mechanism feels contrived, and the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The interdimensional lounge and "tapestry of hidden hours" are evocative, but the anvil scene lacks sensory richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (pendant, tides) is strong, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. The ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the setting and concept, but some phrasing ("objectively emotional") feels unnatural. Tropes are avoided.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story leans on its premise rather than transcending it. The length feels deliberate but slightly cramped.</comment>
