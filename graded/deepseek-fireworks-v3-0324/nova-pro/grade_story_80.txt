<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her daring nature shines, but internal conflict or deeper personality traits are lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the doorknob's mystery, but the transition from logs to roller coaster feels abrupt. Pacing is tight but sacrifices depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strengthâ€”decay and eerie magic are vividly rendered. The roller coaster setting is underutilized despite evocative descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doorknob as key to time) and mood, but the ending's abruptness undercuts thematic resonance. Subtext about obsession is hinted at but not explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (haunted logs, ancient riddles). Some phrases feel generic ("ghostly hues"), though the doorknob's role is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The roller coaster setting doesn't fully justify its inclusion.</comment>
