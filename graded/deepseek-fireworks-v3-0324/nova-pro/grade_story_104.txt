<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steward's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict could be deeper. The "cracks in his façade" are intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The encrypted shipping labels feel slightly forced, but the cameo's role is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the story's tension. The "orchard gate" detail adds texture but isn't fully exploited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (stoic guardian, hidden treasures). The prose avoids clichés but could be more daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the encrypted labels feel tacked on. The length suits the narrative, leaving a lingering thought.</comment>
