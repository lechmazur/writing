<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalence and motivation are clear, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The marbles and puzzle effectively reveal her character, though her "bashful arrogance" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The defragmentation metaphor ties the beginning and end together, though the "final oath" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is evocative but underutilized. The "between heartbeats" motif adds atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (marbles, puzzle) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some themes (cosmic balance) could be more subtly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("bittersweet blend"). The "happily sad" emotion is nuanced, but the tone shifts slightly unnaturally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, though some ideas (e.g., the colony's role) could be expanded.</comment>
