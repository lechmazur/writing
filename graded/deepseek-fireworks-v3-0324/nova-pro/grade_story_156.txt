<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The diplomat's confusion and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt. His "joyfully tragic" emotion is compelling but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the resolution feels rushed. The birds' cryptic message is intriguing but underdeveloped as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like damp air and echoing footsteps are effective, though the village's "counterpoint of hearts" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (birds, key) is strong, and the theme of duality is thought-provoking. However, the ending's impact is diluted by overly explicit moralizing ("a guiding light for all").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (hidden wisdom, transformative journey). The "joyfully tragic" emotion and bird patterns are fresh, but some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story struggles to balance depth with brevity. The word limit forces compression, leaving some ideas feeling underexplored.</comment>
