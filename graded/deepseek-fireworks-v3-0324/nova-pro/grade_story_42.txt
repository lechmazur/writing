<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's guilt and motivation are clear, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The pen as a symbol of her past is effective, but her "resigned exuberance" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the skirmish feels abrupt. The ledger method is creative, though its resolution lacks depth. Pacing is uneven due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple and turbines create a vivid atmosphere, but "loyally unique" is underutilized. Sensory details (wind, pen) are strong but could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (pen, turbines) works well, but the theme of redemption is stated rather than shown. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (guilty forger, ancient wisdom). Some phrases feel formulaic ("heart heavy with guilt"). Emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The pen and temple stand out, but others (skirmish, ledger) feel forced.</comment>
