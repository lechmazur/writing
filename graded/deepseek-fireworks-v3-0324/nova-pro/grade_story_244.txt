<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The swordswoman's guilt and motivation are clear, but her "reservedly bold" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her quest, but her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from beginning to end. The mask's role as the "door of release" drives the narrative effectively, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop and tribal mask create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like flickering lights and whispering carvings enhance the mood, though the timeframe ("final petal") feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (mask, door) and evocative imagery well, but the emotional depth is occasionally stated rather than shown. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (guilt-driven quest, mystical artifact). Some phrases feel repetitive ("labyrinthine carvings"). The tone is consistent, but the style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The storyâ€™s strength lies in its atmosphere, though the theme of redemption could be deeper.</comment>
