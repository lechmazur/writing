<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's pride and feistiness are well-integrated, but her motivation feels slightly generic. Her actions align with her role, though deeper nuance could elevate her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the ritual's resolution feels abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the "closure of a path" lacks impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Amazon setting is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The treehouse city and magical atmosphere enhance the story's mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like symbolism (grimoire) are used well, and the theme of responsibility is clear. The ending is satisfying, but deeper subtext could strengthen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is solid, though "youthify" and some phrasing lean slightly generic. Emotional resonance is shown, not told, but tropes are not fully subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers, but a stronger thematic punch would elevate it further.</comment>
