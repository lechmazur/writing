<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drifter's skittishness and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels abrupt. The ballet shoes as a symbol are effective, but his "pioneer" role isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels rushed. The connection between the ballet shoes and the lunar setting is tenuous, and the ending is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lunar colony is vividly described, but the "barbershop hush" timeframe feels forced. The atmosphere supports the drifter's quest but clashes with the setting's sci-fi tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ballet shoes, loom) is strong, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending hints at depth but doesn't fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (drifter, subconscious power). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The elements cohere but don't fully elevate each other. The brevity feels like a constraint, not a strength.</comment>
