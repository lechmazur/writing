<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The monk's motivation is clear but his "timidly loud" voice feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his quest, but his personality lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the storm chasing headquarters feels underutilized. Pacing is effective, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details. The storm mirrors internal turmoil well, but the headquarters' chaos could be more vividly integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (buttons, storm) is effective, and the theme of bridging past/present resonates. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "forgotten dance"). Some phrases verge on flowery, but the voice avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the storm chasing setting feels slightly forced. The brevity works, leaving a thoughtful impression.</comment>
