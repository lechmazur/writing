<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, though her "earthy farmer" trait feels underutilized beyond surface description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on thematic resonance over structural tension; the "folding" concept is poetic but slightly nebulous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The northern lights and viewing platform create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, though the "hushed euphoria" tone occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scale, recordings) and emotional depth, but the theme of "breaking chains" is reiterated too explicitly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its blend of elements, but some phrases ("timeless tapestry of life") verge on clich√©. The "effectively unique" attribute feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, though the word limit strains the integration of all assigned elements. The ending lingers beautifully.</comment>
