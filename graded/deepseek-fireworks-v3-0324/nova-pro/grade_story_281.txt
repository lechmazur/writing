<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pickpocket's motivation to challenge the status quo is clear, but his transformation through poetry feels slightly forced. His "voice" is distinct but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between poetry and defiance is logical but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly atmospheric, and the eerie dummy enhances the mood. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and uses symbolism well, but the ending lacks punch. The theme of poetic rebellion is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (haunted lighthouse, defiant art). Some phrases feel repetitive or overly poetic without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but elements like "between appointments" feel underutilized. The brevity works, but the story could linger more emotionally.</comment>
