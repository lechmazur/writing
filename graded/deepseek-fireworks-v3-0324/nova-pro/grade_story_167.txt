<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. His actions align with his duty, but deeper personal nuance would elevate his portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The wire coil's role as a catalyst is logical, though the echo method feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (humming air, murmuring echo) immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and emotional resonance, but the ending's resolution leans slightly toward telling rather than showing. Literary devices (e.g., the coil as symbolism) are well-used.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("heart heavy," "shared humanity"). The scholar's logic lacks subtle human irrationality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the echo's execution could be sharper.</comment>
