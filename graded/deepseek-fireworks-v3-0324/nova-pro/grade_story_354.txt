<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wizard's motivation is intriguing but somewhat vague; his "daring compassion" feels underdeveloped, though his obsession with aurora patterns adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on surrealism; the teddy bear portal is inventive, but the transitions between scenes could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly rendered, and the "elegant chaos" tone enhances the atmosphere, though some sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is muted by the abstract nature of the narrative. The ending is satisfying but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases ("cosmic disclaimers") feel forced. The wizard's ethereal nature is a fresh take.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but slightly constrained by its word limit. The elements work together, but the pacing feels rushed in places.</comment>
