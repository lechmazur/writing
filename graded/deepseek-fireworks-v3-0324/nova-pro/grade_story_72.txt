<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The envoy's motivation is clear and poetic, but his "sneering" demeanor feels slightly at odds with his awe at the end. The "furiously tranquil" attribute is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from search to discovery. The "paper trails" concept drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alien vineyard and neglected greenhouse are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the envoy's quest, though the "barren plain" could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (starlight, vines) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, but some metaphors verge on overused ("whispers of the past").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on familiar tropes (quest for the impossible). The prose occasionally feels ornate without purpose. Emotional resonance is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "rambling destiny" tone clashes with the tight plot. The story lingers but doesnâ€™t fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
