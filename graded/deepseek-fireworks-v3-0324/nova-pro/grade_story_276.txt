<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emissary's motivation is clear, but his "uneasy" nature feels underdeveloped. His "consistently surprising" depth is mentioned but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. The tight word limit is managed effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly rendered, and the contrast between high-tech chaos and Earthly simplicity (coathanger, postcards) is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coathanger as a bridge, postcards as redemption) and a satisfying ending. The theme of hidden patterns is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (emissary on a mission). Some phrases ("branches of redemption") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. Leaves a lingering thought about humanity's place in chaos.</comment>
