<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's motivation is clear and consistent, but his 'earnestness' feels somewhat generic. His nostalgia and mission are well-integrated, though deeper introspection could elevate his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between the aqueduct, greenhouse, and map is logical, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with strong sensory descriptions. The ruined aqueduct and greenhouse enhance the theme of decay and renewal, though the desert setting could be more vividly rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (stars, tears) and emotional resonance. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of renewal could be more subtly woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on tropes (knight on a quest). The astronomical map is fresh, but some phrases feel overly poetic without depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity works, but the emotional payoff could linger more.</comment>
