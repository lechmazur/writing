<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but somewhat generic; his "grudging admiration" and curiosity are consistent but lack deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the dream-analysis method feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded island is vividly atmospheric, though the "boisterously quiet" descriptor clashes slightly with the tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the dream-analysis method and "hushed pleas" feel tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
