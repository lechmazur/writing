<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "socially awkward" trait feels underdeveloped. The wooden whistle as a talisman is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels slightly rushed. The "reversed trails" method is confusing and disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Diner setting and late-night atmosphere are evocative and well-integrated, enhancing the character's isolation and quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (whistle, tree of regret) works well, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but leans on familiar tropes (lonely inventor, cryptic messages). Some phrases feel overly polished rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the story feels constrained by the word limit. The whistle and diner are highlights; "reversed trails" weakens momentum.</comment>
