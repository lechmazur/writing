<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear but her "eager lookout" trait feels underdeveloped; her actions align well with her quest for connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the resolution feels rushed; the sewing box and poltergeists drive the narrative effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The villa's fusion of ancient and modern is evocative, but sensory details could be richer to deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the brevity limits thematic depth; the ending hints at reflection without fully delivering.</comment>
