<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "subtle illusionist" trait feels underutilized in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the lace pattern method is intriguing but not fully explored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable lyrical cadences and overused metaphors ("tapestry of emotions").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but some feel forced (e.g., binder clip); the brevity works, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
