<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's compassion and motivation are clear, but her "precisely messy" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated into her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the submarine rivet method feels contrived, disrupting logical flow. The arc is complete but rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel cobbled together. The length exposes rushed execution, though some creative sparks exist.</comment>
