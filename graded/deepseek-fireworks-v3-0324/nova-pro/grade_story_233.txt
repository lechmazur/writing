<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and poetic, but her naivety feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her desire, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The statue's reassembly drives the narrative effectively, though some transitions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The virtual world is vividly rendered, and the vault's atmosphere enhances the story. Sensory details are sparse but evocative when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (statue, lullaby) is strong, and the ending is satisfying. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (chosen one, hidden knowledge). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder but lacks deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
