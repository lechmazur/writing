<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "unsure champion" trait feels underdeveloped. Her rebellious nature and preservation drive are compelling but lack deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The amber brooch and cultural preservation arc work, but the resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chalk cliff setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Church bells and amber brooch are well-integrated sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (brooch, cliffs) is effective, but the theme of "imperfect love" lacks depth. Ending is satisfying but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middling—some clichés ("beacon of hope") and predictable beats. Tone shifts between poetic and generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack daring. The story feels safe, not lingering enough to provoke deeper thought.</comment>
