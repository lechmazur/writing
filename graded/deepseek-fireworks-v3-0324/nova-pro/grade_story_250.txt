<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The heretic's bluntness and enthusiasm are clear, but their motivation to "match wits with an omniscient mind" feels slightly abstract. The teddy bear adds a unique touch but could be more deeply integrated into their personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. The stock ticker as a puzzle device works, though the "battle" metaphor feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with the temple and library evoking a strong sense of decay and mystery. Sensory details like dust and whispers enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Literary devices are used effectively, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper thematic resonance. The conflict is clear but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, though some phrases ("anxious elation") border on overwrought. The heretic's voice is distinct, but the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creatively combines elements. The length feels deliberate, but the thematic depth could be stronger to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
