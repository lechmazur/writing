<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing wobblesâ€”some sections feel condensed, while others linger unnecessarily.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chamber's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting amplifies the character's internal struggle effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the word limit strains thematic depth. The brevity feels intentional but restrictive.</comment>
