<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her cartographer trait feels underutilized beyond mapping emotional neglect. Her voice is distinct but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the forge's symbolism, which occasionally overshadows logical cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is uneven in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital and forge create a striking contrast, but sensory details are sparse. The dragonfly's connection to the setting is poetic but slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (forge, dragonfly) and thematic depth, but the ending feels abrupt. Emotional resonance is achieved, though some "telling" dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on familiar tropes (innocence vs. corruption). Some phrases verge on flowery, and the forge's role borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, but the futuristic setting feels underdeveloped. The length suits the story, though thematic ambition slightly outstrips execution.</comment>
