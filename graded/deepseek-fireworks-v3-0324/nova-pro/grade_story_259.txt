<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "cryptic medium" trait feels underdeveloped; her actions align with her quest but lack deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the double-booking setup feels contrived; the telescope's discovery drives the narrative well, though pacing is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant and telescope create a striking contrast, but "comforting unease" isn't fully realized through sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and theme, but the ending's profundity is overstated; subtext about creation is compelling but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise hampered by predictable "myth-seeker" tropes; some phrases ("whisper secrets") verge on clich√©, though the fusion of tech/myth is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story feels like a vignette; the length suits the concept, but deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
