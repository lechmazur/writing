<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his paradox. His actions align with his mission, but his 'voice' remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between the prism and the storm feels abrupt. The ending resolves too neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and prismatic storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, though the bridle's connection to the setting is weak.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (prism, bridle) and evocative imagery. The theme of order vs. chaos is clear, but the emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (cyber-enhanced warrior, storm confrontation). Some phrases feel overly formal or generic ("euphoric agitation").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, but the story feels constrained by its length. The prism's role is inventive, though the bridle feels tacked on.</comment>
