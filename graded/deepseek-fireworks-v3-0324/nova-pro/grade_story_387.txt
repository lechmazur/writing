<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra's selflessness and musical passion are clear, but her motivation to map celestial migrations feels slightly abstract without deeper personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the centuries-long timeframe strains coherence within the word limit. The climax (lunging to the observatory) feels abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits emotional resonance. The ending lingers but lacks punch.</comment>
