<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's melancholy and subsequent spark of hope are well-conveyed, but his "normally abnormal" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the transition to the zero-gravity dance hall is abrupt and disrupts coherence. Pacing suffers slightly from the surreal shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, especially the ruins and the dance hall, but the connection between the trident prong and the setting feels tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (trident prong, clock) is effective, but the theme of redemption is somewhat heavy-handed. The ending is purposeful but lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal elements, but some phrasing ("sacred disorder") feels forced. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brevity feels deliberate, though the dance hall detracts from the core quest.</comment>
