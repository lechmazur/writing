<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The crystal ball's role in his development is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, but the illness and stranger's introduction feel abrupt. The resolution is satisfying but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The island's transformation is a standout, though "insect symphony hall" feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by occasional telling over showing. Ending is purposeful but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (stranded protagonist, mystical object). Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the elements occasionally overshadow the narrative. The brevity works, but deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
