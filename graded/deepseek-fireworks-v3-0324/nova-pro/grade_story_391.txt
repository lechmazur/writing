<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's roguish nature and motivation are clear, but his "spontaneously cautious" attribute feels underdeveloped. The apron's symbolism is strong, but his actions could better reflect his traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot has coherence but feels rushed. The driftwood carvings method is intriguing but lacks depth in execution. Pacing suffers slightly from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The underwater coral reef city is vividly rendered with sensory details, but the "dust on a piano" timeframe feels tangential. Atmosphere supports the tone well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not fully exploited. The length feels constrained, though the style is deliberate. Leaves a faint lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
