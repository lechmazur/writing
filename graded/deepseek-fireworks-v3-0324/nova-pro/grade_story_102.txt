<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mercenary's spinelessness and indecisiveness are somewhat explored, but his transformation feels rushed. The Victorian dollhouse key's connection to his motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent, with a clear arc, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions feel abrupt, particularly the shift into the projection. The mentor's role is effective but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, with evocative sensory descriptions of the map projection room. The setting enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe ("hush after the wind") feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story employs strong imagery and symbolism (key, maps), but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is present but uneven—some phrases verge on cliché ("shedding like old skin"). The tone shifts occasionally, and the mercenary's reasoning lacks nuanced humanity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, with creative use of elements, but the brevity limits thematic depth. It leaves a lingering impression but could be more polished.</comment>
