<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "apathetic eagerness" feels contradictory. The whip adds intrigue but her eccentricity isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the radio frequency method feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The giant's shoe and soil create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details are strong, but the shoe's connection to the soul concept is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (whip, soil) is effective, but the theme of "urgings of the soul" lacks depth. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on mystical tropes. The whip and shoe are fresh, but the soul concept feels generic. Nuance in Elara's emotions is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The whip and shoe stand out; other elements (radio frequencies) drag.</comment>
