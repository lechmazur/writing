<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The troubadour's motivation is clear but his unpredictability feels underdeveloped. The ring's connection to his lineage is compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent but rushed. The rocket's activation feels abrupt, though the stanzas-to-revelation arc works.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered, but the "hushed euphoria" tone clashes slightly with the somber launch site. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ring, rocket) is effective, but the empathy theme is overstated. Ending is satisfying but lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable "generational curse" tropes. Some phrases ("hushed euphoria") feel forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story leans too heavily on its concept. Length feels deliberate, though some moments need breathing room.</comment>
