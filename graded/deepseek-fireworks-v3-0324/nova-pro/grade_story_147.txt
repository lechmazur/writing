<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "unlucky" trait is underdeveloped. Her naive earnestness is consistent but lacks deeper nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the wind chime method feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the resolution lacks weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, but the workshop's connection to the letter opener is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and mood are strong, but the theme of transformation isn't fully explored. Ending is purposeful but shallow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story leans on whimsy over depth. Length feels deliberate, though impact is fleeting.</comment>
