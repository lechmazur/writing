<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's phobias and spiritual nature are clear but her stunt double background feels underutilized. Her motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" is intriguing but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the garage sale introduction feels tangential. The unraveling of the net drives the story well, though the climax is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library and pyramid setting is evocative, but the garage sales timeframe clashes tonally. Sensory details (dust, whispers) enhance the atmosphere effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (net as gateway) and emotional resonance are strengths, but the ending's triumph over fear feels slightly overstated. The theme of confronting the past is clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (hidden chamber, transformative artifact). Some phrases ("mundanely spiritual") feel forced, but the net metaphor is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the garage sale and stunt double details feel tacked on. The storyâ€™s brevity works, though deeper exploration would elevate it.</comment>
