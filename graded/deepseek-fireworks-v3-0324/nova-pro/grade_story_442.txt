<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is clear but his "edgy" trait feels underdeveloped. The candle task is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration of his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the windmill's significance feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the ending resolution is somewhat vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mushroom house and decaying atmosphere are vividly rendered, but the windmill's connection to the setting is tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (candle, flyer) and mood, but the theme of memory distortion isn't fully realized. Ending lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "vectorized thoughts"), though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clich√©s well.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce decently, but the mushroom house and windmill feel disjointed. Length suits the mood, but depth is uneven.</comment>
