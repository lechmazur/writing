<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "wayward" nature feels underdeveloped. The highlighter pen as a symbol of love is intriguing but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc; the submarine's lurch feels abrupt, and the ending is more reflective than resolved. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine is vividly rendered, but the "battered marvel" tone clashes with the delicate butterfly motif. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (highlighter, butterflies) is creative but heavy-handed. Emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing. Theme of love feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (steampunk outsider, unrequited love). Prose occasionally veers into purple ("infection that spread through the air").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel cobbled together; the submarine and butterflies never fully cohere. Length feels restrictive, not deliberate.</comment>
