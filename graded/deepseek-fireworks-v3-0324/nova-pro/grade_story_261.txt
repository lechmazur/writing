<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's borderline immortality and rigid flexibility are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. Her motivation is clear but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the connection between sketching and ecosystem restoration feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly imagined, and the atmosphere enhances the story's mood, though the timeframe could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery, but the bitter laughter tone occasionally clashes with the hopeful resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (immortal caretaker, restoration arc). The writing avoids purple prose but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the elements sometimes feel more imposed than organic. Leaves a lingering impression, though not deeply resonant.</comment>
