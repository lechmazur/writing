<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The living statue's motivation is clear and consistent, but her telepathic abilities feel underutilized in revealing deeper layers of her personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat meandering; the hair tie's symbolic defiance is compelling, yet the calligraphy method feels disjointed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere, though the timeframe ("throughout planning") lacks clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and evocative prose, but the ending's thematic resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("beacon of hope"). The "tragically joyful" tone is nuanced but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends its elements, though the calligraphy method and "weatherize" action strain believability. Leaves a lingering, bittersweet impression.</comment>
