<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's superficiality and hope-worn nature are clear, but his transformation feels somewhat rushed. His motivation is consistent but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a sense of arc, but the pacing feels uneven, with some moments glossed over. The seashell's role is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating library is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere blends myth and reality well. Sensory details are sparse but effective when present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (seashell, library) is strong, and the theme of perception is explored. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (weary knight, magical library). The prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, and elements serve the narrative. The length works, but some ideas could be deeper. Leaves a lingering thought but not profound.</comment>
