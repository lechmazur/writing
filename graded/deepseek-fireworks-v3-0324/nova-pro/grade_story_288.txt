<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elio's motivation is clear but his "professionally wild" demeanor feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between the ozone station and paddleboarding feels forced. Pacing is decent, though the ending resolves too neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, but the ozone station's relevance to the theme is tenuous. Sensory details are strong, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (eagle, flag) is effective, but emotional impact is muted. The theme of freedom is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (wandering artisan, symbolic eagle). Some phrases feel overly flowery without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constructed around them. The length suits the narrative, but depth is sacrificed.</comment>
