<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's passive conspirator trait is well-integrated, but her transformation feels slightly rushed. The comic as a symbol of rebellion is strong, but her motivation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within the word limit, but the quantum foam setting occasionally disrupts logical flow. The arc from passivity to purpose is clear but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quantum foam and desert sands create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective. The setting enhances the story's surreal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (comic, sands) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of rebellion could be deeper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but leans on cosmic surrealism tropes. Some phrases feel overly poetic ("dying star," "tapestry of lives"). Emotional resonance is genuine but occasionally stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the quantum foam feels underutilized. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of hope. Creative but not flawless.</comment>
