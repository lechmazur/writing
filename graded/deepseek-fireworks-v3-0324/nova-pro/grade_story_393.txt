<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her suburban setting feels incongruous with her alchemist identity. Her actions align with her goal, but her 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The chain-reactive coincidences feel contrived, and the resolution is abrupt. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (tar, candlelight), but the watchtowers and tar pit feel underutilized despite their potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (coin, chrysalis), but the ending lacks emotional depth. Theme of lineage is clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (ancient cipher, family treasure). Some phrases feel generic ("desperate hope"), though the coin's warmth is a fresh touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The suburban alchemist premise is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>
