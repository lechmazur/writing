<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's motivation is clear but his ethically questionable nature feels underdeveloped. The knitting and gloves add texture but lack deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot meanders without a strong arc; the cryptic codes and cosmic wonder feel more thematic than plot-driving. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Jazz Age setting is evocative but underutilized. Sensory details (gloves, mug) are strong, though the "time capsule" concept lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (knitting as cosmos, mug as bridge) are clever but overexplained. The ending lacks punch, though the theme of wonder resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans formulaic (e.g., "cosmic wonder" repetition). Nuance is sacrificed for stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements feel assembled rather than organically fused. The Jazz Age backdrop is more aesthetic than essential, weakening cohesion.</comment>
