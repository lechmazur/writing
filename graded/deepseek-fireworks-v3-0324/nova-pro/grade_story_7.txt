<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from discovery to resolution feels slightly abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details that enhance the setting's mystique. The facility's duality as both a collection site and sanctuary is compelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the chorus of healing could be more deeply integrated to heighten emotional impact. The ending is purposeful but slightly predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically deliberate, but a few elements (e.g., star paths) feel underdeveloped. Leaves a lingering sense of mystery.</comment>
