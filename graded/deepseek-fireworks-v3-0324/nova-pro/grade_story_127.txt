<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "secret" feels underdeveloped. The gauntlet effectively reveals her past, but her creative block could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the coral reef texture feels forced. Pacing is strong, though the resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge is evocative but underutilized. The coral reef texture clashes with the setting. Atmosphere supports mood but lacks deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact and symbolism, especially with the gauntlet. Ending is satisfying, but some metaphors (coral reef) distract rather than enhance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise, but the coral reef and "coded desperation" feel contrived. Avoids clich√©s but struggles with seamless element integration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite forced elements. Creative use of steampunk and gauntlet, but coral reef weakens the narrative's focus.</comment>
