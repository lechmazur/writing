<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's hive-mind therapist role and uniformly peculiar demeanor are well-integrated, but her motivation to "anchor the ephemeral" feels slightly abstract. Her actions and voice are distinct, though deeper personal stakes could elevate her further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between the phone charger plug and the wax-dripping method feels tenuous. The arc is clear, though the resolution leans on symbolism over concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dimly lit facility and "merry bitterness" tone create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (melting wax, whispered confessions) are evocative, though the setting's "secret agent" aspect is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wax, plug) and subtext about memory. The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict—anchoring fleeting moments—lacks urgency. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sound of hindsight"). Avoids clichés, though the hive-mind therapist concept risks feeling gimmicky. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, but the facility's spy-training purpose feels incidental. The brevity serves the theme well, leaving a lingering melancholy.</comment>
