<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lumberjack's motivation is clear but his "gracefully awkward" trait feels underutilized in driving his actions. His shift from learning healing traditions to leading a resistance is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the coded letter's revelation and the resistance formation lack buildup. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is vivid and atmospheric, but the bike rides and "harsh tenderness" tone are less integrated into the setting's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ossuary as resistance hub) works well, but the theme of hidden agendas lacks depth. The ending is purposeful but feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (coded prophecies, unlikely heroes). Some phrases ("harsh tenderness") feel forced rather than evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The lumberjack's arc is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>
