<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mr. Thompson's welcoming demeanor is consistent, but his motivations and depth feel underdeveloped. The tenants' reactions to the parade show some character growth, but their individual voices are indistinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the parade's introduction feels abrupt. The connection between the bee pin and the climax is strong, though pacing suffers slightly in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The studio's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, but the "manic clarity" tone clashes occasionally with the quiet setting. The bee pin's symbolism elevates the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (bee pin, weathered hearts) is effective, but emotional resonance is uneven. The ending is purposeful, though some themes are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the bee pin's use, but "weathered hearts" leans clich√©. The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks stylistic distinctiveness in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the parade detour feels contrived. The brief length works, though deeper thematic exploration is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
