<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The knight's transformation from cold-natured to artistic is compelling, but his initial motivation (collecting folk remedies) feels slightly underdeveloped in relation to his rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the transition from folk remedies to artistic rebellion feels abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, with the intersection and altars enhancing the story's mood. The contrast between sterile agency and artistic rebellion is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (mitten, altars) and evokes emotional resonance, though some themes could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. However, the "lawfully rebellious" attribute leans slightly toward trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, though the secret agent center feels underutilized. The brief length works, leaving a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
