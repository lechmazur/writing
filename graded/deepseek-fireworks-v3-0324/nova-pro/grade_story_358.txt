<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mage's motivation is clear but his "purposefully aimless" attribute feels underdeveloped. His shift to cuddling the fragment is abrupt, lacking deeper emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The pharaoh's spirit resolves the conflict too neatly, and the "uncharted frontier" payoff lacks thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse and sanctified dread create a striking atmosphere, but the playground time contrast feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror, fragment) is effective, but the emotional impact is diluted by the abrupt ending. The theme of love feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans on tropes (wise spirit, magical artifact). The "cuddle" twist is fresh but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The playground time detracts more than it adds.</comment>
