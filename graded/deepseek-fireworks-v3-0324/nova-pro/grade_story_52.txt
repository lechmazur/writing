<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but the transition from pickpocketing to karaoke is abrupt, lacking smooth cause-and-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The marketplace inside an hourglass is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the timeframe ("chalk lines fading") feels slightly tacked on.</comment>
