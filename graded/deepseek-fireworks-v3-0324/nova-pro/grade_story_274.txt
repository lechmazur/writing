<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's sentience and apathy are intriguing but her sudden shift to curiosity lacks deeper exploration. Motivation is clear but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels rushed. The drive-in setting is underutilized, and the ending lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details. The abandoned drive-in enhances the mood but could tie more tightly to Elara's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (bookmark, films) and subtext. Ending is ambiguous but purposeful. Theme of exploration vs. stagnation is clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, though the "hidden knowledge" trope is slightly generic. Emotional resonance is subtle but effective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite tight constraints. Elements serve the story well, but the brevity limits depth. Leaves a lingering sense of unresolved curiosity.</comment>
