<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's reserved nature and motivation to preserve art techniques are clear and consistent, but her "oracle" role feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the connection between the choir and Elara's work could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly atmospheric, though the choir's presence occasionally distracts from the central setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, but the story's brevity limits deeper exploration of its rich concepts.</comment>
