<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with his ghost-seeing ability and quest for liberation well-integrated into his actions. His "elegantly clumsy" attribute could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from dissonance to acceptance. Pacing is strong, though the ghost tours could feel slightly tangential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lab setting is evocative and mirrors Leo's internal struggle. Sensory details (e.g., the flower crown's whisper) deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sand castles, silence as canvas) and emotional resonance elevate the story. Ending is satisfying and thematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Minor risk of "dissonance of silence" feeling over-repeated, but subtext avoids clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, layered narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
