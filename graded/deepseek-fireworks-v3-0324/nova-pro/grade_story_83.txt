<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher's motivation is clear but his "mischievous wisdom" feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his mission, but his personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the candle wick's cryptic map, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth of broken mirrors creates a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like the scent of leaf raking enhance immersion, though the timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirrors, wick) is effective, and the ending hints at deeper meaning. However, the emotional impact is muted by the protagonist's detached perspective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and shows originality in its premise. The researcher's method feels fresh, though some descriptions verge on overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity works. The story lingers but lacks a strong thematic punch.</comment>
