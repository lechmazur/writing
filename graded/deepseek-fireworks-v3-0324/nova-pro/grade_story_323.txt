<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's carefree nature and dancer persona are well-integrated, but her motivation to collect sacred practices feels slightly disjointed from her initial whimsical quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the shift from shoelace to sacred rituals is abrupt. The ending ties back elegantly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treehouse metropolis is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing its whimsy. The setting actively supports the absurdity of Lila's quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shoelaces as sacred objects) and subtext, though the theme of absurdity could be sharper. The ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original but occasionally formulaic (e.g., "twinkling with ancient wisdom"). Some metaphors feel fresh, others generic. Emotional nuance is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the sacred practices thread feels tacked on. The brevity works, leaving a lingering whimsical aftertaste.</comment>
