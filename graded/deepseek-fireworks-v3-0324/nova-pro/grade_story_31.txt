<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian's solemnity and quiet dedication are well-established, but his motivation for connection could be more deeply explored. The child's curiosity contrasts effectively but feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot flows logically, but the "x-out" action feels abrupt. The key's symbolism is strong, though the resolution leans on thematic resonance rather than narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk garden is vividly rendered, with bioluminescent details enhancing the contrast between sanctuary and chaos. The "hush between heartbeats" moment is atmospheric but slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (key, garden) is potent, and the theme of overlooked connections is poignant. The ending lingers, though the dialogue occasionally veers into exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in its cyberpunk-meets-tender-fable approach, but the "endearingly irritating" trait feels forced. Avoids clichés, though the child's role borders on archetypal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the garden and key elevating the narrative. The brevity serves the story’s meditative quality.</comment>
