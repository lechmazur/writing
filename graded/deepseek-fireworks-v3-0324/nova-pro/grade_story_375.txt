<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orion's motivation is clear and consistent, with his smile contrasting his destructive actions. His use of the flashlight and interaction with mannequins reveal depth, though his "wrath of a star" motive feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, with sabotage driving the arc. However, the mannequins' role feels underdeveloped, and the ending's sudden resolution slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with the radio towers and gorge enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (sparks, static) immerse the reader, though the mannequins' whispers could be more tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flashlight as hope) and subtext (imperfection as strength). The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "angry peace"). Nuanced handling of emotion, though the star-wrath motif leans slightly toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about resilience in decay.</comment>
