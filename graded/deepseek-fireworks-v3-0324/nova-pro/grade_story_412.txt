<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "bookish assassin" trait feels underdeveloped. The rubber key cover reveals depth, but her assassin aspect lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cyclical nightmares drive the plot coherently, but the pacing feels repetitive. The arc is clear but lacks dynamic escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The station's atmosphere is evocative, and the hum of equipment enhances mood. The setting supports Elara's isolation but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (key cover) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks resonance. Theme of transformation is clear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its length. The style is deliberate but lacks lingering impact.</comment>
