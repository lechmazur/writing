<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's lazily ambitious nature is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his resilience feels more told than shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but leans on convenience (e.g., gossip as a method). Pacing is tight but functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, though "hidden whimsy" could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (drill as resilience) works, but emotional impact is muted. Ending is purposeful but abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise, though some tropes linger (enchanted object, guardian). Language avoids purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but ambition strains the word limit. Leaves a faint lingering question.</comment>
