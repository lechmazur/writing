<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation from skeptic to guardian feels slightly rushed. The petals effectively reveal his emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc, though some transitions between actions (e.g., recipe testing to message discovery) are abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground mushroom farm is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the eerie, melancholic atmosphere. The contrast with the subway is striking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (petals, mushrooms) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. Shows more than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional phrases feel overly poetic ("frantic peace"). Avoids clich√©s but leans slightly into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about grief, though some thematic depth is implied rather than explored.</comment>
