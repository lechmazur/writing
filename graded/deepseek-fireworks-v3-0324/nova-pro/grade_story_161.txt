<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transition from orchardist to conspiracy investigator feels abrupt. Her vigilance and sardonic glee are well-portrayed, though her "orchardist" background is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed, with the conspiracy unraveling too quickly. The connection between the orchard's destruction and the paper planes is tenuous. Pacing suffers due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The setting is unique but lacks depth. The paper airplane facility feels underdeveloped, and the orchard's destruction is mentioned but not vividly evoked. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism (peacock's tail) effectively, and the ending is satisfying. However, the emotional impact is muted by rushed storytelling. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise is original, but execution leans slightly formulaic. Elara's sardonic glee feels forced at times. The antique seal is a fresh element, but the conspiracy angle is generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but strained by its elements. The orchardist angle feels tacked on, and the word limit hinders depth. Some creative sparks, but not fully realized.</comment>
