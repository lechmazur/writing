<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's guarded nature and dedication to preserving ancient wisdom are clear, but her "pensive mirth" feels underdeveloped. The amulet's effect on her could reveal more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. The amulet's nightmares as a puzzle piece work, but the pacing feels rushed in the latter half.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The power plant setting is evocative, and the seashell's whimsy contrasts well with the grim atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "shimmered under dim light") are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (seashell, rocking chair) is effective, but the theme of "hum of humility" feels forced. The ending lacks emotional punch despite its thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on familiar tropes (artifact as memory bridge). Some phrases ("theoretically whimsical") feel contrived. Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The seashell and amulet connection is inventive, though the rocking chair motif is underutilized.</comment>
