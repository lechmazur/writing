<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "secretive" nature feels underdeveloped. The "angrily peaceful" attribute is intriguing but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the connection between hacking music playlists and folk medicine feels forced. Pacing is solid for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, but the "marathon training" timeframe clashes with the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (teapot as legacy) works well, but the emotional impact is muted by abrupt transitions. Theme of preservation is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (haunted park, lost genius). Some phrases feel AI-generated ("angrily peaceful resolve").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by them. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering depth.</comment>
