<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's moral code and motivation are clear, but his "voice" lacks distinctiveness. The bottle caps add depth, but his reactions could reveal more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has coherence but feels rushed. The rake handle inscription is a clever clue, but the pacing struggles in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered, blending antiquity and modernity effectively. Sensory details (tea steam, marketplace buzz) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (bottle caps, inscriptions) is strong, but the ending lacks punch. Theme of forgotten legacies is poignant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of hacker and ancient setting avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("confident uncertainty") feel contrived. Emotional nuance is present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. Leaves a lingering thought but could delve deeper.</comment>
