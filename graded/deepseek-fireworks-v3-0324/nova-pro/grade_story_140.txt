<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ethan's motivation is clear but his "tortured protector" role feels slightly underdeveloped; his transformation is compelling but could use more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the planetarium encounter feels abrupt as a catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, abandoned setting. The doll and setting are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's resolution leans slightly toward predictability. The storm metaphor is effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by tropes (haunted doll, tortured hero), but the execution elevates it. Some phrases verge on clich√© ("forgotten dreams").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the planetarium link feels forced. The brevity works, though the theme could linger more.</comment>
