<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Father Thomas's lapsed priest background and confusion are well-integrated, but his motivation to "step beyond fate's design" feels slightly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolism; the jogging action and snow patterns method are inventive but could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and "dull radiance" create a haunting atmosphere, though the beanstalks' whimsy clashes slightly with the solemn tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (abacus, snow patterns) and thematic depth, but the ending's hope feels abrupt after such weighty introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though the "price of complacency" theme risks becoming didactic. The abacus metaphor is fresh but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits full thematic exploration. The jogging motif is clever but underutilized.</comment>
