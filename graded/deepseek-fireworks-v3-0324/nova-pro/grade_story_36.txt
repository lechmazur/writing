<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "calm doomsayer" archetype feels slightly underdeveloped. The skateboard as a symbol of lost innocence is effective, but his transformation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The skateboard's role in the climax is strong, though the steampunk workshop feels somewhat disconnected from the barn loft setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative but uneven. The steampunk workshop clashes tonally with the barn loft, and sensory details are sparse. The train whistle is a standout element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skateboard, train whistle) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on clich√©. The theme of reclaiming innocence is well-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (lost innocence, defiance of stagnation). The prose avoids purple tendencies but lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite disparate elements. The skateboard and train whistle elevate the narrative, but the steampunk workshop feels superfluous. Leaves a lingering emotional impression.</comment>
