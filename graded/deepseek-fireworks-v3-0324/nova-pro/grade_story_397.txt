<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alex's jaded nature and dual life as a bartender and crystal cultivator are intriguing, but his motivation to understand the past feels somewhat abrupt. His actions align, but deeper introspection would strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the scalpel discovery driving the narrative. The connection between doodles and global secrets is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The laboratory setting and fireworks timeframe create a vivid atmosphere. The contrast between sterile lab and bloodstained scalpel is striking, enhancing tension and curiosity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (scalpel, doodles) and subtext (preservation of knowledge) are strong. The ending is purposeful, though the theme of challenging fate could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in combining crystals and global conspiracy, but some phrases ("optimistic desperation") feel forced. Emotional resonance is present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the length feels deliberate. The story lingers with its mystery, though the climax could be more impactful.</comment>
