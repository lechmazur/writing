<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's rebellious nature and motivation are clear, but her transformation feels somewhat rushed. The pocket knife as a symbol of resilience is effective, but her "sadly joyful" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent, with a clear arc from refuge to connection, but the pacing stumbles slightly in the middle. The culinary passion twist feels abrupt, though it ties into the theme of adaptation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is vividly rendered and enhances the mood, but the transition from gloom to warmth could be smoother. Sensory details are strong but occasionally overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the ending leans toward sentimentality. The theme of adaptation is clear, though the culinary connection feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (haunted house as sanctuary, rebel archetype). Some phrases feel overly polished, lacking raw human nuance. The culinary element is a weak point.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but struggles to fully integrate all elements. The brevity works, but the culinary passion feels tacked on rather than organic.</comment>
