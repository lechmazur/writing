<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "frenzied juggler" archetype feels slightly underdeveloped beyond his functional hands and obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and driven by the juggler's actions, though the tea-leaf method feels abrupt and undermines momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "yawning void" and "abandoned summer" create a haunting atmosphere, but the void's lack of sensory detail occasionally weakens immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise, but the juggler's "frenzy" and tea-leaf method edge toward contrivance. Love-letter subtext saves it from clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the tea leaves and void feel like missed opportunities for richer symbolism.</comment>
