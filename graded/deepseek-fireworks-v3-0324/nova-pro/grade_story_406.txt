<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spy's motivation is clear but her "diabolically benevolent" nature feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her goal, but her personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and time reversal is cleverly used, but the pacing feels rushed in the second half. The button's significance is clear but could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The brewery's atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, but the "morning paper" timeframe feels disconnected from the main action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (the button) and atmosphere enhance the story, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”time reversal and the spy's goal are fresh, but some phrasing feels formulaic. The tone ("borrowed valor") doesn't fully land.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and elements are well-integrated, but the brevity limits thematic depth. It feels like a vignette rather than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
