<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's shift from aimlessness to purpose is clear, but his internal transformation lacks deeper exploration. The handkerchief connection feels intuitive but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch-to-recipes pivot is inventive but abrupt. Pacing is uneven, with the ending resolution rushed. Coherence holds, but transitions need refinement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength—archival dust, melting snowflake, and grilled grains create vivid immersion. The setting elevates the thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (handkerchief as talisman, hopscotch as cipher) is compelling, but the theme of vigilance feels overstated. Emotional resonance is bittersweet yet uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans slightly generic. "Mournful elation" and "seeds of vigilance" verge on cliché. Sensory details save it from blandness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite odd pairings (hopscotch/recipes). Length feels deliberate, but some ideas needed more room to breathe. Lingers, but not profoundly.</comment>
