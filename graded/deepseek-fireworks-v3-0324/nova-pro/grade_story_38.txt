<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's insomnia and obsession with botanical samples create a compelling, if somewhat fragmented, character study. His motivation for non-violence is clear but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric vignettes. The whispers and attic scenes drive tension, but the drunken confessions feel underdeveloped as a method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The haunted attic and cityscape are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The "empty abundance" tone, however, occasionally clashes with the story's urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (whispers as warnings, botanical symbolism) are effective, but the ending's resolution feels rushed. The theme of non-violence resonates but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in its blending of insomnia, botany, and whispers, though the drunken confessions trope weakens authenticity. The poet's voice avoids cliché but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but uneven—some elements (whispers, attic) shine, while others (after-parties) detract. The brevity feels intentional but leaves some threads underdeveloped.</comment>
