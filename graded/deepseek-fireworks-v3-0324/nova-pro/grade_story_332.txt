<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painter's solitude and artistic drive are clear, but his "fiercely gentle" nature feels underdeveloped. The notepad as a confidant works well, but his leap of faith lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot meanders without a strong arc. The garden and notepad recur, but the "realms of surprise" and "hushed confessions" feel disjointed. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly imagined, but its connection to the painter's art is inconsistently explored. Sensory details are sparse but effective when present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (notepad, garden) is promising but overused. Emotional impact is muted by repetitive phrasing. The ending lacks resonance despite thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but execution leans formulaic. "Fiercely gentle" and "realms of surprise" feel forced. Some AI-like repetition in phrasing ("battered notepad").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not transformative. The garden and notepad sustain interest, but the story feels constrained by its word limit rather than elevated by it.</comment>
