<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "seldom odd" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align well with her collector persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the final act. The board game stakes escalate logically, though the frost giant's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly rendered, and the contrast with Elara's study enhances atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (black rose) and thematic depth, but the "earnest flippancy" tone wobbles. Ending resonates, though the game's resolution lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (despair as an alpha predator). Minimal clich√©s, though the party invitation feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the board game mechanic overshadows solitude's thematic potential. Length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic weight.</comment>
