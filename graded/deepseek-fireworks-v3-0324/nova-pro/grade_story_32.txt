<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sentinel's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "literal uniqueness" feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration of how it shapes his actions beyond the surface.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstraction; the coin-toss method is inventive but risks feeling gimmicky without tighter cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost town and dawn setting is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details, though the "between shows" timeframe feels slightly tacked on.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional resonance, but the ending's hopeful surge clashes subtly with the earlier grim tone, undermining thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing (e.g., "tapestry of sound"). The simulated reality twist feels fresh but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the word limit strains the depth of the sentinel's conflict. The brevity works, but some themes beg expansion.</comment>
