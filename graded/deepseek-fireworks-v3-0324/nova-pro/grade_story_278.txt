<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's brooding nature and artistic refuge are well-established, but his transition to detective feels slightly abrupt. Clara's introduction adds depth, but her role could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the conspiracy's resolution feels rushed. The glasses' discovery effectively drives the narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The desolate research base and sterile atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tension. Sensory details like the dusty glasses and hum of machinery stand out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (glasses, dust) and emotional resonance, but the climax's "dance of dust" feels contrived. The ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (brooding artist, hidden conspiracy). Some phrases verge on flowery, though the setting and object usage feel fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the glasses and servitude motif adding depth. The brevity works, but the escape could feel less convenient.</comment>
