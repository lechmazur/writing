<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is intriguing but somewhat abstract; the "braided bitterness" and "cosmic chaos" are compelling but could be more grounded in tangible actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the transition from order to chaos feels abrupt. The "cosmic blink" is a striking device but could be better integrated into the pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details (porcelain shards, marble reflections). The office setting contrasts well with the chaos, but its role could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary devices elevate the story. The mask and reflections are potent metaphors, though the theme of nonviolence feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "braided bitterness" tone is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, but the word limit strains the integration of all elements. The ending lingers, but some concepts feel rushed.</comment>
