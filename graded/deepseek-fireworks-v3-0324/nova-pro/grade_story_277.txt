<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "precisely playful" nature feels underdeveloped. The empty coin purse as a symbol is effective but could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The labyrinthine path method works, but the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop's atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the "golden age" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and imagery, but the theme of "broken precedents" could be more subtly woven. The ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (labyrinth, hidden truths). Some phrases feel overly ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the elements occasionally feel imposed rather than organic. The brevity works in its favor.</comment>
