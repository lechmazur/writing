<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orion's cosmic powers and academic wildness are intriguing but could be more deeply explored. His motivation is clear but somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the leap into the abyss feels abrupt. The ritual's connection to the resolution is strong but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (brooch, abyss) is compelling, and the ending is satisfying. However, some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on cosmic/mythic tropes. The prose avoids clich√©s but could be more distinctive in voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative well. Leaves a lingering sense of transformation.</comment>
