<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nova's nostalgia and fearlessness are clear but lack deeper exploration. Motivation is consistent but somewhat surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause-and-effect, but pacing feels rushed in resolving the crisis. The arc is complete but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details (e.g., "ethereal glow," "fizzed with energy"), though the facility's betrayal could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (telescope, crystals) and subtext, but emotional resonance is muted. Ending is purposeful but lacks lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable AI tropes (e.g., "circuits hummed"). Some fresh metaphors, but prose occasionally leans generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. Creative combination of concepts, though depth is sacrificed.</comment>
