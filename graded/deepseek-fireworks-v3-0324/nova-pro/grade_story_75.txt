<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism and credulity are well-balanced, driving her actions believably. Her motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear, though her transition to disowning modernity feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with the bookmark serving as a clever catalyst. The resolution is satisfying, though the storm metaphor feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is intriguing but lacks vivid sensory detail. The contrast between technology and nature is hinted at but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark, vows) and emotional resonance. The theme of rediscovery is poignant, though some metaphors verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on familiar tropes (lost rituals, guardian role). The "angry peace" tone is unique but inconsistently conveyed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels intentional. The ending lingers, though the grassroots movement could be more fleshed out.</comment>
