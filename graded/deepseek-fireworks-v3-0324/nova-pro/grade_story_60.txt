<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blacksmith's indifference is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to seal covenants feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmosphere over action; the ribbon's transformation lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory detail and atmosphere, though the catacombs' "pulsing" life feels slightly overdone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story's brevity limits emotional resonance; feels like a vignette rather than a full arc.</comment>
