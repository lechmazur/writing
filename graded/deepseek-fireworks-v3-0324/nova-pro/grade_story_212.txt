<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "typically atypical" attribute feels underdeveloped. His connection to the magician’s deck reveals depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but feels rushed in places. The connection between the farmer’s labor and the magician’s deck is intriguing but could be tighter. Pacing struggles within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>World-building is evocative, with strong sensory details. The "ethereal plains" and post-war setting enhance the atmosphere, though the "raw solace" tone occasionally clashes with the hopeful undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (seeds, cards) and subtext, but emotional impact is uneven. The ending is purposeful but lacks resonance. Theme of defiance is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (apocalyptic farmer, messages in bottles). Some phrases feel formulaic. Nuance in emotion is present but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not seamlessly integrated. Style supports clarity, but the word limit feels restrictive. Leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
