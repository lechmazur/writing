<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magician's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "underdog" status feels underdeveloped. His use of the microscope and sun patterns reveals depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on abstract concepts. The countdown motif adds tension, but the resolution feels abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and twilight atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like dust and shadows are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (microscope, sun patterns) is strong, but the "subtle uprising" theme lacks emotional punch. The ending is purposeful but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (lonely seeker, hidden truths). Some phrases ("drainingly invigorated") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word count. The magician's breakthrough lacks the weight to linger.</comment>
