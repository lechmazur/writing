<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orion's motivation is clear but his "meekly assertive" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his goal, but his personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the connection between gossip columns and the bouquet feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space station setting is evocative, but "joyful loneliness" clashes with the desolation. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (bouquet, oath) is heavy-handed. The ending is purposeful but lacks emotional resonance. More "show" than "tell" needed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (blood oaths, secret societies) without subversion. Some phrases feel AI-generated ("joyful loneliness").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by them. The length suits the premise, but originality is lacking.</comment>
