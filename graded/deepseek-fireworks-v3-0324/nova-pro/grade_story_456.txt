<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The florist's motivation is clear but her "morbid" and "neutrally passionate" traits feel underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable, with a rushed resolution. The cosmic cycles concept isn't fully exploited for tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo and guttering lantern create a vivid atmosphere, though the setting's connection to the florist's quest could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle, cycles) is effective, but the ending feels overly neat. Subtext about life/death is present but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on mystical tropes. Some phrases ("boldly timid") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story lacks a lingering punch. The florist's arc is tidy but not unforgettable.</comment>
