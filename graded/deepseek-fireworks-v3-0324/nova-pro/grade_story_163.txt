<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear but her "lost heiress" status feels underdeveloped. Her "bitterly optimistic" attribute is compelling but inconsistently integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is coherent but the xenobiology station feels abruptly introduced. The detour-to-overlook transition works, but the resolution is rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid, especially the clouds and scenic overlook, but the research station's contrast feels underexplored. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., fragmented reality symbolism) are effective, but the theme of unification lacks depth. The ending is purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from tropes (lost heiress, alien research). Some phrases feel repetitive ("reckless precision"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but elements like the research station feel tacked on. The length suits the arc, but some themes are underdeveloped.</comment>
