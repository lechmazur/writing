<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's spinelessness and wavering resolve are intriguing but underdeveloped. Her motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels slightly meandering. The connection between floral language and the owl could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky are vividly rendered, but the "doleful cheer" tone isn't fully realized in the setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("wise yet sorrowful eyes"). The ceramic owl is a standout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive but slightly uneven. The elements serve the story, but the brevity limits depth.</comment>
