<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's softhearted nature and obsession with fate are clear, but her motivation could be deeper. Her actions align well, but her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but feels rushed. The belt buckle's significance isn't fully explored, and the ending lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and planetarium are evocative, but sensory details are sparse. The atmosphere supports the theme but could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (buckle, stars) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is present but leans on tropes (cyberpunk, fate). Some phrases feel generic, and the tone shifts slightly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by word count. Elements serve the narrative, but depth is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
