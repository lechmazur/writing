<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "peaceful anger" feels underdeveloped. Her visions add depth, but her transition from faux to real fortune teller lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The discovery of the flute and archive feels abrupt, and the group's formation lacks setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly detailed, especially the archive's sensory descriptions. The setting enhances the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (flute as a key) is effective, but the ending lacks emotional punch. Themes of heritage are clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (chosen one, hidden wisdom). Some phrases feel generic ("surge of purpose").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by word count. Elements serve the story, but depth is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
