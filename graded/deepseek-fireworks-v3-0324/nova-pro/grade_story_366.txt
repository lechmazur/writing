<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's telepathy and noble foolishness are intriguing but her motivation to decode journals feels abrupt. Her actions align but lack deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the glacial pattern's sudden significance and rescue mission feel rushed. Pacing struggles in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting is unique but underutilized. The dock's atmosphere is mentioned but not deeply woven into the story's mood or sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery (ice crystals, button hook), but themes of success and foolishness are stated rather than shown. Ending is purposeful but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but "noble foolishness" and telepathy verge on tropes. Emotional nuance is surface-level in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements feel cohesive but some (button hook, dock) are underdeveloped. Length constraints hinder full exploration of ideas.</comment>
