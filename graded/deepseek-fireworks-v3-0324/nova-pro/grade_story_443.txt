<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The reaper's heartbreak and motivation are clear, but his transformation feels slightly rushed. His "softly thunderous" presence is evocative but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on symbolic progression (seeds, springs) without enough concrete cause-and-effect. Pacing is unevenâ€”some moments linger, others gloss over key transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cave library is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of "untold stories" enhances the theme. Sensory details (dust, dim light) are effective but sparse in later sections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (novel, seeds) and emotional resonance, but the ending's hope feels somewhat unearned. The theme of renewal is clear but could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into predictable phrasing ("fractured soul," "glimmer of hope"). The reaper's grief is nuanced, but the bird/seeds metaphor feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the story sometimes prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative momentum. The brevity works, though some transitions lack finesse.</comment>
