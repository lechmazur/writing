<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alex's lovelorn spy persona is clear, but his shift from desperation to camaraderie feels somewhat abrupt. His motivation is consistent but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The recipe's symbolic role ties the narrative together, though the mirror vision feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Neo-Tokyo's slums are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The setting enhances the story's mood and themes, though the futuristic element could be more integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity works. The story lingers but could delve deeper into its themes.</comment>
