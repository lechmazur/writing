<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's apathy and transformation are clear, but the motivation shift to coral reefs feels abrupt. The "enthusiastically lazy" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc, but the connection between the grinder, frames, and coral reefs is tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The studio and "gentle sharpness" atmosphere are vividly rendered, though the dying god's impact feels underutilized. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (grinder, frames) is compelling, but the theme of rebuilding reefs lacks depth. The ending is satisfying but leans on whimsy over substance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but relies on vague mysticism ("river wisdom"). Some phrases feel AI-generic (e.g., "gentle sharpness"). Nuance in emotion is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well, but the coral reef goal feels grafted. The brevity works, though some transitions are jarring.</comment>
