<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from underachiever to empowered mage is clear, but her "exceptionally usual" trait feels underdeveloped. Her motivation to reclaim heritage is compelling but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The doll head's role as a guide is logical, though the misdelivered packages feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and farmland boundary create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (blinking eyes, pulsing magic) enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll head as heritage) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some themes (e.g., limitations) could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on tropes (magic heritage, underdog arc). Some phrases feel generic ("heart raced," "pulse quickened").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story cohesively. The length feels deliberate, but the farmland detail is underutilized.</comment>
