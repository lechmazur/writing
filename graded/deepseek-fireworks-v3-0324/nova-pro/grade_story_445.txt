<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nomad's spiritual connection to the barbells is intriguing, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract and underdeveloped. His "sleepy" attribute is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, but the transition from barbells to secret agent disguise room is abrupt. Pacing is uneven in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The forest and twilight setting is vividly rendered, but the disguise room feels disjointed. Sensory details (e.g., glinting metal, whispers) are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (barbells as arrogance) is effective, but the theme is somewhat heavy-handed. The ending resolves neatly but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (wise wanderer, fallen strength). Some phrases feel overly poetic without purpose ("canvas awaiting brushstrokes").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under word count. The disguise room feels tacked on. Style is polished but occasionally verbose.</comment>
