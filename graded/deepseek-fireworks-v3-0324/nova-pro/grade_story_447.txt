<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her 'voice' could be more distinct. The stuffed toy symbolism is strong but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the future bulletins feel underdeveloped as a driving force. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the setting. The kitchen and toy are meaningfully connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending leans slightly didactic. Theme of rebellion is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The toy's deterioration is a fresh metaphor, though some phrasing borders on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative element integration. Leaves a lingering thought but could push boundaries further.</comment>
