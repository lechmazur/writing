<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elise's forgetfulness and passion are somewhat compelling but lack deeper exploration. Her motivation to protect the fragment is clear but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the negotiation's resolution feels rushed. Pacing is decent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault and Parisian setting are evocative, but sensory details could be richer. Atmosphere supports the story well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (fragment as hope) is effective, but emotional resonance is muted. Ending is satisfying but lacks deeper thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is middlingâ€”urban forager and stained-glass fragment are fresh, but execution leans slightly generic. Some AI-like phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere decently, but the story feels constrained by its length. Creative but not groundbreaking.</comment>
