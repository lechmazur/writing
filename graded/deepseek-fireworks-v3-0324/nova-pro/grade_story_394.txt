<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archer's motivation is clear but her "aimlessly passionate" attribute feels underdeveloped. Her actions align with her goal, but her personality lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in places. The connection between the bent fork and the climax is weak.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subterranean colosseum and amusement park setting is evocative, but sensory details are sparse. The atmosphere supports the tone well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (leaves, fork) is effective, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes (hidden knowledge, chosen one). Some phrases feel overly flowery without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but some elements feel forced. The length works, but the theme could be more nuanced.</comment>
