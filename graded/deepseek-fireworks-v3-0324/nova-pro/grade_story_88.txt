<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tiqa's motivation is clear and consistent, but its "mathematically poetic" attribute feels underdeveloped. The child's moment of language spark is a strong touch.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the retreat method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blending of ancient and futuristic settings is evocative, but sensory details could be sharper. The lanterns enhance atmosphere effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lanterns, tin type) and thematic depth, but the ending lacks emotional punch. Subtext about preservation is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, though the AI's voice occasionally feels overly logical. Avoids clichés but could lean further into nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the toaster AI and palace setting feel slightly disjointed. Leaves a lingering thought about storytelling’s value.</comment>
