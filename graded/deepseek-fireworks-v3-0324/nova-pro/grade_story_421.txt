<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration. His "ferociously polite" demeanor feels underutilized in driving his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat predictable. The marinerâ€™s wheel as a key object works, but the mission's stakes feel vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the workshop's connection to the wheel could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and mood, but the emotional impact is muted by repetitive phrasing ("anguished joy").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (chosen-one narrative). Some phrases feel overly polished yet hollow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story lacks a lingering punch. The brevity feels intentional but not fully exploited.</comment>
