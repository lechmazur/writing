<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and unique, but his 'soul-broker' role feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his obsession with forgotten songs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but lacks a strong conflict or resolution. The pacing is effective, though the ending feels more contemplative than conclusive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea platform is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere is immersive. Sensory details (dust, glass, waves) enhance the mood beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, metaphor) are used well, but the emotional impact is muted. The theme of memory is compelling but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though some phrases verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the story feels more like a vignette than a complete narrative. The elements serve the atmosphere more than the plot.</comment>
