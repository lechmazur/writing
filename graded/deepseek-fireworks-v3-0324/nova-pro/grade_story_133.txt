<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her jaded nature feels underdeveloped. Thorne's calm demeanor contrasts well but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but the throne's connection to hunting methods feels forced. Pacing is solid within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush sensory details elevate the orchard's atmosphere, though the rooftop colonial town is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, throne) is effective, but emotional resonance is muted. Ending hints at deeper themes but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (hidden throne, mysterious benefactor). Some phrases feel overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. Gloves and orchard stand out; throne falters.</comment>
