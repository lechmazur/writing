<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orion's motivation is clear but his "desert wanderer" backstory feels underdeveloped. His curiosity drives the plot, but his distinct voice is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The connection between the brass ruler and "translated love" is intriguing but under-explored due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The space pirate ship and crow's nest create a vivid atmosphere, but the "orchardâ€™s last apple" timeframe feels disjointed from the cosmic setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (brass ruler, sacred knowledge) is strong, but the emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (space pirates, cosmic mysteries). The "authentically artificial" detail is fresh, but some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The style is clear, but the brevity limits thematic exploration.</comment>
