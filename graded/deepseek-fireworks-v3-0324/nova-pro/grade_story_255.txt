<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seer's motivation is clear, but her "nondescript" nature and "innocent cynicism" feel underdeveloped. Her analytical innovation is shown but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the USB decryption, but the surprise party timeframe feels disconnected. Pacing is tight, though the resolution is somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and rain scent are evocative, enhancing atmosphere. However, the party's hush is underutilized in grounding the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of sensory details and symbolism (rain, relic), but the theme of delayed justice lacks deeper exploration. Ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in combining tech and myth, but some phrases feel formulaic ("heart raced," "satisfied smile"). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive, but the surprise party and innocent cynicism feel tacked on. The relic's revelation lingers, though the execution lacks surprise.</comment>
