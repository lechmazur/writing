<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jasper's motivation is clear but his "virtually peculiar" nature feels underdeveloped. His actions align with his curiosity, but his outlaw cowboy poet persona lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The misaligned dice and changing walls introduce intrigue, but the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing suffers from the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is evocative, but the coffee shop walls clash tonally. Atmosphere supports curiosity but lacks consistent sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, walls) is effective, but the ending lacks impact. Themes of destiny and curiosity are present but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (outlaw poet, runic dice). Some phrases feel repetitive ("ever-changing walls"). Emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its length. The steampunk setting and curiosity theme show promise but aren't fully realized.</comment>
