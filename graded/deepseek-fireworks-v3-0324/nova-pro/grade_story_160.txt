<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his clandestine nature. His analytical freedom is well-utilized but could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The braille-to-goggles transition is smooth, though the "final bow" connection feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is vividly rendered, and the wilderness encroachment enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details are strong but could be more varied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (goggles, braille) and a resonant ending. The theme of defiance is compelling, though some emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (mysterious relics, lone wanderer). The "prickly wonder" tone is unique but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers, though the "final bow" tie-in slightly disrupts cohesion.</comment>
