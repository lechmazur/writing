<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear but his "naive gambler" trait feels underdeveloped; his unpredictability is mentioned but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc but the climax (energy surge) feels abrupt; pacing is uneven in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (candlelight, crashing waves), though the station's machinery is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle mold, tides) is strong, but the ending's "hollow victory" lacks emotional punch. Dialogue is sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise, though some phrases verge on flowery ("symphony of laughter and tears"). Avoids major clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length; the professors' role is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
