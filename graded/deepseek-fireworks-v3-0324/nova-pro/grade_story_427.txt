<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's mechanical arm and dream-weaving motivation are intriguing but lack deeper exploration. His reaction to the sock is symbolic but feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence but leans heavily on abstract concepts. The sock's revelation as a key feels abrupt, though the arc is complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and coded desperation create a vivid atmosphere, but the "hush of applause" is underutilized. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the enlightenment moment feels rushed. The theme of equilibrium is compelling but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans into abstraction without enough grounding. Some phrases ("tangibly abstract") feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but the story struggles to balance profundity with brevity. The sock's significance lingers, though execution is uneven.</comment>
