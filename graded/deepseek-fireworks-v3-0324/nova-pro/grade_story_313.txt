<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear but his transformation feels slightly rushed. The tape dispenser as a symbol is effective, but his "unusually normal" attribute isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans on supernatural exposition. The pacing is tight, though the ghostly confrontation resolves too neatly for the dystopian tone.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dystopian farm is vividly rendered, but the ghostly elements clash tonally. Sensory details (e.g., "air thick with despair") are strong but occasionally overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (tape dispenser) and theme (redemption) are compelling, but the ending's hopefulness feels unearned. Dialogue with apparitions is purposeful but lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but relies on tropes (haunted farm, con artist seeking redemption). Some phrases ("lull of remorse") feel repetitive. Emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere despite tonal shifts. The tape dispenser and remorse concept elevate the story, but the dystopian setting feels underutilized.</comment>
