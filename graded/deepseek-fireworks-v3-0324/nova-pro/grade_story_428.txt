<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alex's transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his shift to seeking solace in the temple feels abrupt. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed. The temple visit resolves his arc too neatly for the word limit. Cause and effect are logical, but pacing suffers.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, especially the bunker and temple. Sensory details (incense, worn ink blotter) enhance immersion, though the temple's connection to his youth could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but the "self-imposed chains" theme leans clich√©. Nuanced handling of paranoia, though the temple's wisdom feels slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its length. The ink blotter and constellations are inventive, but the resolution lacks lingering impact.</comment>
