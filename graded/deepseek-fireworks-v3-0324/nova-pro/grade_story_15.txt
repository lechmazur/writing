<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's grief and defiance are compelling, but her motivation could be more nuanced. The postcards feel slightly contrived as a method.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on the postcard device, which risks feeling gimmicky. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fog-laden orchard and forge are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (forge as love/loss), but the postcards' mystery borders on cliché. Ending is poignant but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but falters in execution—postcards feel AI-generic. Emotional resonance is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the postcards strain believability. The brevity works, but deeper thematic exploration is missed.</comment>
