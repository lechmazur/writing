<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc, though the connection between decoding diaries and equalizing her soul could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, but the wilderness guide element feels tacked on. The ending lingers nicely.</comment>
