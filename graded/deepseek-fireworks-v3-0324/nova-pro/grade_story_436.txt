<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's sorrow and motivation are clear, but her emotional depth could be more nuanced. Her actions align well with her traits, though her "voice" lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the action, but the pacing feels slightly rushed. The connection between beginning and end is strong, though the resolution leans on convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood. Sensory details are effective, but the floating fortress could be more integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism well, but the ending's impact is slightly diluted by abruptness. Theme and subtext are present but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but some phrases feel formulaic. Emotional nuance is shown, not just stated, though the plastic spoon's inclusion borders on gimmicky.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and creative, but the tight word limit occasionally hinders depth. Leaves a lingering feeling, though not fully resonant.</comment>
