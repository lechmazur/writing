<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "trustworthy yet strange" eyes feel underdeveloped. His defiance and connection to the past are compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed. The catapult action is abrupt, and the star alignment lacks buildup. The arc is clear but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and borrowed dawn create a vivid, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (tablecloth as relic) is strong, but emotional impact is muted. The ending is purposeful but lacks deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (defiant exile, forgotten empire). Some phrases feel overly poetic without substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under word limits. The story feels deliberate, though the catapult moment is jarring.</comment>
