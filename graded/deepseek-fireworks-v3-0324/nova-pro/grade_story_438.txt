<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mystic's motivation is clear and intriguing, but his "hollow recklessness" feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but somewhat rushed; the mystic's actions with the polaroids and lab override could be more logically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The contrast between the sterile lab and the mystic's flamboyance is vivid, but the "last star map" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (compass, polaroids) is strong, but the emotional impact is muted by the story's brevity and lack of deeper conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept, though the mystic's voice occasionally slips into generic "mystical" phrasing. The polaroid method is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but constrained by its length; the elements serve the narrative but don't fully transcend it.</comment>
