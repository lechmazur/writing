<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but somewhat generic; the bodyguard's "serene anger" and kinship with the scientist feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the plan's formation and execution lack depth. Pacing suffers from word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lunar greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, but "park visits" feel incongruous. Sensory details are strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (photograph, greenhouse) works, but emotional impact is muted. Ending is tidy but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (oppressive forces, rebellion). Some phrases feel AI-generic ("timely rebirth").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack depth. Feels like a sketch rather than a fully realized story.</comment>
