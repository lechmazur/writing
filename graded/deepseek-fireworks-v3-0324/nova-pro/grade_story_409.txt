<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fighter's paradoxical incompetence and determination are intriguing, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped. The "standing for something" theme is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the abduction, but the transition from discovery to action feels abrupt. The word limit constraints show in pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The attic and clockwork animals create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (ticking, chisel strikes) enhance immersion, though the "forgotten dreams" method lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (shard, chisel) and subtext (self-deception). The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on tropes (bruised fighter, prophetic object). Some phrases feel overly ornate ("symphony of time"). Nuance in emotion is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels constrained by its word count. The theme resonates, though execution lacks polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
