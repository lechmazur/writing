<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear but his "earnest mockery" attribute feels underdeveloped. His outlaw status is mentioned but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on atmospheric buildup. The method of matching paint smudges is intriguing but lacks deeper payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The marketplace setting is vividly rendered, though the "shimmer of possibility" concept feels overused. Sensory details are strong but occasionally repetitive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Literary devices are present but some metaphors (e.g., "tapestry of history") verge on cliché. The ending hints at depth but doesn’t fully deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable tropes (outlaw seeker, hidden power). Some phrases ("whirlwind of theories") feel AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but the story feels constrained by its word limit. The pouch and smudges are underutilized for thematic weight.</comment>
