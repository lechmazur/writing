<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, blending gambling thrill with deeper cultural preservation. His telekinetic dice and family tradition add unique layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well, but the space pirate setting feels underutilized. The tapestry's resolution is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (flickering flame, eerie shadows), though the "space pirate" element clashes tonally with the medieval relic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dragons, trees) and subtext (preservation vs. piracy). The ending resonates, though the crew's sudden shift feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blending of sci-fi and fantasy tropes, but the "sacred disorder" tone wobbles. Kael's emotional depth avoids AI sterility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but the space pirate backdrop feels tacked on. The storyâ€™s brevity works, leaving room for thematic reflection.</comment>
