<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "reincarnated goldfish caretaker" feels slightly forced. The toy soldier symbolism is strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc, but the weather-driven chance encounter feels contrived. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed and immersive, with strong sensory elements. The library setting enhances the story's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative use of symbolism and subtext, though the ending's resolution feels slightly rushed. Theme of forgiveness is well-conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on some tropes (e.g., haunted guilt, magical recipes). Emotional resonance is nuanced but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of hope, though some elements feel underdeveloped.</comment>
