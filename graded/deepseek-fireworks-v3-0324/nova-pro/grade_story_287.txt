<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "torn visionary" aspect feels underdeveloped. His optimism and persistence are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The anachronistic cellphone adds intrigue, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details. The overgrown library and catacombs enhance the atmosphere and align with the theme of lost knowledge.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism and subtext, though some emotional depth is told rather than shown. The ending is satisfying but could resonate more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly on familiar tropes (quest for hidden knowledge). The cellphone is a fresh twist, but some phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the tight word limit slightly hinders thematic exploration. Leaves a lingering sense of discovery.</comment>
