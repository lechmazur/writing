<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's impulsiveness and whimsy are clear, but motivation to "right a historical wrong" feels underdeveloped and abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies too heavily on contrivance (shooting stars as key) and lacks logical cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, though the fortress-waterfall pairing feels slightly overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism and atmosphere are effective, but emotional impact is diluted by rushed resolution and thin thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality falters with tropes (forgotten legacy, shooting stars as magic), and prose occasionally veers into purple territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack ingenuity; the story feels constrained by its premise rather than elevated by it.</comment>
