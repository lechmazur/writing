<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of his "technically wild" attribute. His actions align with his quest, but his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The coded scuffs as a method work logically, though the judge's verdict feels slightly disconnected from the main narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating marketplace and forest are vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere enhances the alchemist's quest, though the "mundane miracles" tone could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (the scale, fountain) and a satisfying ending. The theme of immortality's cost is explored, but some emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original setting and concept, but some phrases verge on clich√© ("heart pounded," "eternal life beckoned"). The alchemist's reasoning lacks nuanced hesitation for an "uncertain" character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the judge subplot slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
