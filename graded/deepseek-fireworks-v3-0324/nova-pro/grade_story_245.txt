<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The smuggler's frustration and longing are clear, but his "irate" nature feels underdeveloped. The chopstick and tea ritual add depth, but his motivation could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on introspection. The jogging action feels repetitive; tighter pacing would heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly atmospheric, and the cold, silent setting amplifies the smuggler's isolation. Sensory details (steam, breath) are well-used.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (tea leaves, waterfalls), but the emotional impact is muted by excessive abstraction. The ending hints at hope but lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (tea leaves as waterfalls), though some phrasing leans flowery. The smuggler's voice avoids clich√© but could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story feels constrained by its length. The chopstick and tea leaves work well, but the "heart's revolt" theme is under-explored.</comment>
