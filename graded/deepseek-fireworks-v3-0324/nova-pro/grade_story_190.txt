<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "meticulously impulsive" nature feels slightly contradictory. The pressed butterfly adds depth, but her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The painter's confession drives the story effectively, though the connection to the drought center feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is intriguing but underutilized. The "enthusiastic apathy" tone is unique but clashes with the story's emotional core. Sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue is purposeful. The theme of empathy is explored with nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original but leans slightly into tropes (e.g., the gaunt visionary). Some phrases feel overly poetic. Emotional resonance is achieved but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the drought center feels tacked on. The length works, and the story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
