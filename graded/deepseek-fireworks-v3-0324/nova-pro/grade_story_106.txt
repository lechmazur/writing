<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's transformation from sullen to inspired is clear, but his initial motivation feels somewhat generic. The stamps and quilt patches add depth, but his "objectively biased" perspective isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and well-paced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The concept of "erasing boundaries" drives the narrative, though the underwater setting feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underwater city power station is evocative but lacks immersive sensory details. The atmosphere supports the mood but doesn't fully capitalize on the unique setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stamps, quilt) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overused. The theme of transformation is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in its combination of elements, but the underwater setting feels underdeveloped. Some phrases ("borrowed valor") lean toward clich√©. The emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity works, but the underwater city's potential isn't fully realized. Leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
