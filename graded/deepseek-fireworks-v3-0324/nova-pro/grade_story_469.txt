<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the 'blameless smuggler' attribute feels underexplored. His emotional-logic blend is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, though the 'final countdown' tension feels slightly underutilized. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (garden scent, whispering gallery), but the 'grandiose modesty' tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skeleton key, map) and subtext, but the emotional impact could be sharper. Ending is satisfying but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by some predictable tropes (labyrinthine tunnels, moonlight chamber). Nuance in emotion is stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels slightly constrained by them. The length is deliberate, though the theme could resonate more.</comment>
