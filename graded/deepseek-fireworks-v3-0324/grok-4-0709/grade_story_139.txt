<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brother Elias's stubbornness and motivation to avenge his mentor are clear and consistent, but his inner conflict with his "dark reflection" could be more deeply explored to fully distinguish his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the flute and shipping label serving as effective catalysts. The pacing is excellent, though the climax (realizing the assassin's identity) could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The enchanted gondola and mountain setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the mood of cautious peril. Sensory details (frosted windows, humming cables) immerse the reader brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (flute, tooth marks) and subtext (inner demons vs. justice) are strong, but the ending's trap feels slightly abrupt. Literary craft elevates the narrative, though the emotional punch could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, avoiding clich√©s. The flute's ritualistic marks and the "dark reflection" concept feel fresh, though the prose occasionally leans overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly, with the brief length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, though the thematic depth of "harvesting the past" could be more fully mined.</comment>
