<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent with her traits, blending sarcasm and determination. Her "voice" is distinct, though her panic could be more deeply explored to heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from despair to action. The puzzle box mechanism ties neatly to the resolution, though the "lost years" timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (neon billboards, scarred bar) amplifying the eco-apocalypse tone. The desert and billboard maze are powerfully symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich use of literary devices (e.g., water rings as maps, seed as rebirth). The ending satisfies with thematic punch, though some metaphors edge toward over-elaboration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "eco-apocalypse bingo"). Sarcasm avoids clich√©, though some environmental messaging verges on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on stewardship and defiance.</comment>
