<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elandor's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "formally casual" demeanor feels slightly underdeveloped. His thin-lipped description adds a distinct visual, but more inner conflict could deepen his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the ritual's climax could benefit from a sharper resolution. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with vivid sensory details (dust, decaying paper) that elevate the forgotten library. The mine setting amplifies the tone perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fruit of knowledge, labyrinthine certainty) and subtext about obsession stand out. The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though "formally casual" feels slightly forced. The Viking-warlock fusion is inventive, and prose avoids excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with creative use of the figurehead and discredited textbooks. The length feels deliberate and impactful.</comment>
