<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured and coherent, with the locket's reveal serving as a satisfying climax. Pacing is strong despite the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors (e.g., rivets as a magical lattice). Minimal clich√© reliance, but the guardian's "shadows and screams" edges toward tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, and the brevity feels intentional. The story lingers with thematic weight, though the syndicate threat remains abstract.</comment>
