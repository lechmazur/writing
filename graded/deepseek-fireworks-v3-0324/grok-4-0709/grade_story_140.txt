<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' tortured protector role is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His internal conflict and eventual resolution are compelling, though some nuance in his emotional shift could deepen authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The planetarium encounter and circus climax connect logically, but the transition between them feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus and dawn setting are masterfully atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood and themes. Sensory details (e.g., cracked mirrors, dust motes) immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (doll, stars) and evocative prose. The ending is satisfying, though the emotional resonance could be sharper. Some telling ("he felt a pull") weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional flowery phrasing ("hush of dawn’s second breath") risks purple prose. Avoids clichés but leans slightly into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. Leaves a lingering question about Elias' new fate, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
