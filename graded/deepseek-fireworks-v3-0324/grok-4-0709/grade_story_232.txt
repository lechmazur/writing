<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, blending scientific rigor with mystical intuition. His exhaustion and determination are palpable, but his backstory could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the coffee grounds and cutlass driving the action logically. The pacing is excellent, though the curse's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (ocean, firelight, barnacles) enhancing the dire enchantment. The digital nomad camp feels underutilized, however.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and layered subtext (science vs. mysticism, curses as ethical dilemmas) elevate the story. The ending is haunting but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (screens as modern runes) and nuanced emotion avoid clich√©s. The coffee-ground method is original, though the pirate trope skirts predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the cutlass and inscriptions serving the theme. The brevity feels intentional, but deeper nomad-world integration would strengthen cohesion.</comment>
