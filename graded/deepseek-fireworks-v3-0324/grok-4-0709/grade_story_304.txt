<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is compelling and consistent, but his "lurking assassin" persona feels slightly underdeveloped. His use of the camera lens is intriguing but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, though the spider's web method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is vivid and immersive, with the baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight creating a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details are superb.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (camera lens, dawn) and emotional resonance, but the ending's abruptness slightly undermines impact. Subtext is rich but could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The paint-splattered lens and "superficially profound" theme stand out, though the assassin trope is somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering, melancholic impression.</comment>
