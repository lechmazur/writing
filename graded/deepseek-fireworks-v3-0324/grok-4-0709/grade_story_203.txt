<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's stage fright and exorcist role create a compelling contrast, and his motivation to confront inherited lies is clear and poignant. His actions align well with his internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the ritual of submerging the locket driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is efficient, though the ghost's appearance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's eerie, isolated tone. Sensory details (e.g., bubbles in the vat) ground the cosmic scale in intimate moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (wildflowers, toys as debris) and a resonant theme of rewriting personal history elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, with Elias's calm underscoring his growth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of sci-fi and spiritual themes. Avoids clich√©s, and the prose is purposeful, though "defiant hush" is slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>
