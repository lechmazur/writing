<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's telekinetic dice and gambling nature are well-integrated into her character, but her motivation to preserve farming methods feels slightly disconnected from her high-stakes persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elara's ritual, though the transition from mutinous crew to ceremonial act is abrupt. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The navigation room and hydroponic grove create a vivid contrast, enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details (flickering lights, fire) are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (dragons, flame) and subtext (preservation vs. chaos) are strong, but the ending lacks emotional punch. Writing style is lyrical but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, but some phrases ("sacred disorder") feel repetitive. Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the crew's mutiny is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the story feels slightly constrained by them. The length is deliberate, and the theme lingers, though the climax is muted.</comment>
