<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eron's cyber-templar identity and fraying convictions are compelling, but his motivation to "reflect lightning back at the storm" feels slightly abstract. The worn leather bridle serves as a strong symbolic anchor, though.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the prism's use, but the climax (prism cracking) feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the word limit constrains deeper exploration of cause-effect relationships.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's bleak, ritualistic tone. Sensory details (bones, storm light, vultures) ground the high-concept elements effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bridle, prism) and evocative prose, though the ending’s thematic punch ("cyber-faith fractured") slightly overshadows emotional resonance. Subtext about faith vs. technology is sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original blending of cyberpunk and mystical tropes. Some phrases ("digital ghosts," "euphoric agitation") verge on over-poetic, but the overall voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, striking vignette. The brevity feels deliberate, though more thematic depth could elevate it further. Leaves a lingering question about faith’s fragility.</comment>
