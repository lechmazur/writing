<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, though some nuances of his "scarred past" could be more explicitly explored. His actions consistently align with his quest for healing, and his "gracefully awkward" pedaling adds a unique physicality to his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and maintains a strong arc, but the transition from decoding the letter to revamping the restaurant feels slightly rushed. Pacing is mostly effective, though the tight word limit limits deeper exploration of cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is vividly rendered, with rich sensory details (truffle-infused bone marrow, skull-etched ceilings) that enhance the eerie yet gourmet atmosphere. The Pacific Northwest backdrop complements the tone perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, using symbolism (bones as both relics and healing tools) and evocative prose ("harsh tenderness"). The ending is purposeful, though the thematic depth of "hidden agendas" could be further developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise and execution, avoiding clich√©s. The writing is fresh and specific, though a few phrases ("stern lover's caress") edge toward familiarity. Emotional resonance is strong, with nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brief length works, though some thematic layers could benefit from expansion. It leaves a lingering question about redemption and legacy.</comment>
