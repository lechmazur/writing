<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's unhinged zealotry is vividly portrayed, driving his actions consistently. His motivation—finding strength in vulnerability—is clear but could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, with uprooting driving tension, but the whispered confession feels abrupt. The arc resolves but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jungle-Victorian parlor clash is brilliantly evoked, enhancing the absurdity. Sensory details (dirt, flickering lamps) are immersive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. The brief length works, leaving a lingering reflection on fragility.</comment>
