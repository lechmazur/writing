<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's flighty nature and cartographer skills are well-integrated, but his serene anger could be explored deeper to align more consistently with his motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the linearization of lore feels abrupt, though the grease-stained patch ties neatly into the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting contrasts effectively with the mystical rituals, and the strangely normal details enhance immersion. Sensory descriptions are sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, though the flicker of unity could be more emotionally resonant. The ending is satisfying but lacks lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases verge on over-formality. The grease-stained patch is a fresh, unexpected touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the tight word limit slightly strains the narrative's depth. Leaves room for thematic expansion.</comment>
