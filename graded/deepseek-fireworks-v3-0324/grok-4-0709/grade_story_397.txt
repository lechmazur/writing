<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jack's motivation is clear and deeply personal, driving his actions convincingly. His transformation from bartender to desperate scientist feels organic, though his "jaded" aspect could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The connection between doodles and crystals feels slightly strained, but the cause-and-effect logic holds. The climax is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lab's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the mood. The "final stillness" timeframe amplifies tension, though the fireworks motif feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact, with effective symbolism (scalpel as talisman) and thematic depth. The ending is satisfying, though the "global broadcast" concept risks veering into contrivance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The doodle-to-crystal method is inventive, though some phrasing ("optimistic desperation") edges toward over-formality. Nuanced handling of guilt and redemption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection. A few logical leaps, but the core idea lingers compellingly.</comment>
