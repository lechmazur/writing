<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear and compelling, but his "irate" nature feels underdeveloped beyond a few mentions. His use of the chopstick and tea leaves reveals depth, but more nuance in his rebellion would elevate this.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from jogging to tea-leaf reading feels abrupt. The connection between the flight deck and waterfalls could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The atmosphere perfectly supports Jax's internal conflict, though the "hidden waterfalls" concept slightly clashes with the gritty setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and emotional resonance, but the "biting sincerity" tone occasionally veers into melodrama. The ending is satisfying, though the tea-leaf prophecy borders on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding AI tropes. However, the "abstractly physical" heart revolt feels strained, and the chopstick's role risks being overly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story, though the elements occasionally compete for dominance. The brevity works, but some concepts (like the waterfalls) needed more grounding.</comment>
