<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Straw's fervent apathy is a compelling contradiction, driving his actions with eerie consistency. His motivation (oath to the giant) is clear, though his lack of emotional depth may limit reader connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect. The VR encounter escalates tension cleanly, though the hacker's defeat feels abrupt. Pacing balances urgency and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional worldbuilding—the fossilized giant’s bones and time loops create a haunting, immersive backdrop. Sensory details (glowing lines, pixel-ash) amplify the uncanny tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fan as reality-folder, straw heart syncing with boundaries) and striking prose. Theme of balance resonates, but emotional impact is muted by Straw’s detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original blend of folkloric and cyber elements. No clichés; fresh metaphors ("veins of forgotten lightning"). Style is precise yet evocative, avoiding purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for mystery. Lingers in the mind due to its eerie, layered contradictions.</comment>
