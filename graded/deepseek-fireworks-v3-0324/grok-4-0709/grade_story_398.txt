<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Mira are vividly drawn, with clear motivations that drive their actions. Elias's empathy and Mira's cynicism are compellingly contrasted, but Mira's transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from despair to hope. The dream sequence effectively bridges the narrative, though the tight word limit slightly strains the resolution.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is richly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mystical tone. Sensory details (ashes, waves, creaking looms) immerse the reader, though the "between waves" timeframe could be more distinctly utilized.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ashes, calendar) and emotional depth. The theme of resilience shines, though the ending's hopefulness borders on predictable. Dialogue, though sparse, is purposeful.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The "dysfunctionally functional" motif is refreshing, but some descriptions verge on overly ornate. Nuanced emotion, but Elias's sincerity could use more subtlety.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and compelling, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels intentional, though the dream mechanic slightly strains plausibility. Leaves a lingering impression of hope.</comment>
