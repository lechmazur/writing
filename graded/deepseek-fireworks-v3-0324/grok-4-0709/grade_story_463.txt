<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit and clear motivation (learning spirit-binding) drive the narrative well, though his internal conflict could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from list-crossing to resolution. Pacing balances urgency and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Haunting lighthouse setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (salt-crusted walls, candlelight) amplifying the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (rope, locket) and subtext (promises as prison). Ending is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of ghost story and tango, though "eroding promises" verges on clich√©. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "reckless blade").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically; the brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering melancholic resonance.</comment>
