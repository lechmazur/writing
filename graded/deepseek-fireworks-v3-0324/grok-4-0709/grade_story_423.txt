<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eldric's motivation is vivid and consistent, driving his actions with emotional depth. His earnestness and nostalgia are well-integrated, though his "knight" role feels slightly archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly paced, with the greenhouse discovery triggering a logical chain reaction. However, the aqueduct's role feels underutilized in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The desert and ruined aqueduct create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details. The greenhouse's juxtaposition with the arid setting is particularly evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stars/scars, water/thaw) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the "canvas of life" concept verges on overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "whispered secrets of lost rivers"). Avoids clich√©s, though the knight archetype leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the astronomical map and greenhouse tears serving the theme ingeniously. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
