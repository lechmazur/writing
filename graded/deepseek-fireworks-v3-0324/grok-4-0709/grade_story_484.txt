<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn with clear motivation; flippant solemnity adds depth. Alignment with rebellion theme is strong.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but initiation via discoloration feels slightly contrived. Pacing is tight, though the ritual's suddenness could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly immersive; mansion and protest backdrop enhance tension. Sensory details (dust, shimmer) excel.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror shard) and theme resonate, but ending’s "beacon" transformation leans slightly abrupt. Literary devices are well-deployed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice avoids tropes; "liquid rebellion" and grotesque humor feel fresh. Nuanced handling of moral decay.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere powerfully, with thematic depth. Length feels deliberate, though mirror’s role could be foreshadowed earlier.</comment>
