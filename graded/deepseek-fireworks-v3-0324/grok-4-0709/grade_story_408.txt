<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, his backstory as a conscientious objector adding depth to his malevolence. His actions align well with his established traits, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's schemes, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, but pacing could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with storm-battered imagery enhancing the sinister atmosphere. Sensory details are effective, though some descriptions border on overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and uses symbolism well (e.g., the rusty nail). The ending is purposeful, but the theme of malevolence could be subtler. Literary devices are employed skillfully.</comment>
