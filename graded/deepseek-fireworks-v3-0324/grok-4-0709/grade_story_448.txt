<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's distrust and motivation are clear, but her "rebelliously docile" attribute could be more deeply explored to avoid feeling superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the candlestick's discovery, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is well-managed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The guild hall's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with soot-stained walls and the sewing machine adding nostalgic texture. Sensory details elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seashell, sewing machine) and thematic depth. Ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Avoids clich√©s, but the seashell method feels slightly contrived. Nuanced handling of Elara's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, supporting the theme of innovation vs. tradition. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of transformation.</comment>
