<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is vividly portrayed, aligning well with his actions and the symbolic mask. His voice is distinct, though the "anxiously relaxed" tension could be explored deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The method of disruption (ghostlike reflections) is creative but slightly underdeveloped in execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements woven seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
