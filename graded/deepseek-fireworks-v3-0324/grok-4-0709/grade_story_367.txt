<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but her "fervent indifference" feels slightly contradictory; her actions align well with her pursuit of perfection, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the goose-as-sign method feels abrupt, slightly disrupting the flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's mood, though the "napping" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext, but the ending's lesson about perfection feels slightly didactic rather than fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("fervent indifference") toe the line of over-formality. Emotion is shown more than told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, though the goose element slightly strains believability. Leaves a lingering question about perfection's cost.</comment>
