<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's passive resistance is clear and consistent, subtly revealed through his actions and the comic's symbolism, though more nuance in his voice could elevate it further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with Elias's shifts and the comic readings driving momentum. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the quantum foam's mechanics could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's tension. Sensory details (e.g., "frayed pages," "whispering tales") deepen immersion and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext (rebellion as erosion) and layered metaphors (desert sands, dance) make this hauntingly memorable. The ending lingers with quiet power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The comic as rebellion heirloom is ingenious, though the "quantum foam" risks feeling slightly tropey.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-flawless cohesion of elements. The brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant questions about hope's quiet persistence.</comment>
