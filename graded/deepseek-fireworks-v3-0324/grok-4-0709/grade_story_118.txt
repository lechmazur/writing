<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Agent Lark's motivation is clear, but the hive-mind therapist lacks depth beyond its eerie presence. The interplay between Lark's regrets and the Collective's method is compelling but could delve deeper into psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from Lark's torment to resolution. The method of draining hindsight via wax is inventive, though its execution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive, with sensory details (ozone, shifting floors) enhancing the spy-facility atmosphere. The "uniformly peculiar" tone meshes perfectly with the surreal therapy session.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wax runes, frayed wires) and subtext about regret. The ending is satisfying, though the Collective's sarcasm occasionally overshadows emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors ("hindsight hissing like a deflating balloon"). Minimal clich√©s, though the hive-mind's merry bitterness edges close to trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's theme of tangible regret. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the cost of "draining" hindsight.</comment>
