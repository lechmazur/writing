<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's gentle conjurer attribute is well-integrated with her motivation and actions, revealing depth through her blend of fear and joy. However, her distinct "voice" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the butterfly’s reassembly, but the reversed messages method feels slightly forced. Pacing is solid for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground city and glowing fungi create a vivid atmosphere, though the brittle branch timeframe’s connection to dwarven wards is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (butterfly, garden) and emotional resonance are strong, but the "joyful terror" tone occasionally clashes with the justice theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the stained glass butterfly and reversed messages, though some phrasing leans flowery. Avoids clichés but could refine emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the dwarf lord’s role feels underbaked. The ending lingers beautifully, though the word limit strains some setups.</comment>
