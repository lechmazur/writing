<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jax's bluffing swindler persona is well-integrated, but his "invisible allies" feel underdeveloped. Elara's contrast to him is sharp but could use more depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with clear cause-and-effect, though the computer's restart feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of post-collapse tech and agrarian life is inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the "meet-cute" feels forced. The story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
