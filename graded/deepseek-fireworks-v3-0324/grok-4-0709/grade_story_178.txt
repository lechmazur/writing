<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, though the trivia night feels slightly contrived as a setup for the encounter; pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feels cohesive and deliberate; elements serve the story well, leaving a lingering sense of wonder.</comment>
