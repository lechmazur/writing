<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' wistfulness and arrogance are well-balanced, driving his actions and motivation clearly. However, his distinct voice could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but the transition from mapping dust motes to holographic flowers feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade and skylight are vividly rendered, enhancing the contrast between wildness and machinery. Sensory details are immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of motes as seeds) are effective, but the ending’s fadeout lacks emotional punch. Theme of reclamation is clear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story’s brevity hints at unexplored depth. The lingering thought of reclamation is potent but underdeveloped.</comment>
