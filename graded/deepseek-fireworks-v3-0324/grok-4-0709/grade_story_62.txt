<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation to rewrite existence is compelling, but his sewer-philosopher duality feels slightly underdeveloped. His "rarely honest" attribute shines, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong, but the chilling bedtime story method feels abrupt. The mundane-to-horror pivot is intriguing but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully eerie—the orchard amphitheater and overripe fruit scent elevate the haunting mood. A standout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (the cup as existential void) is potent, but the ending’s "thrill of potential rewrite" feels rushed. Strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and unsettling, though the "candid deceit" tone occasionally wavers into forced ambiguity. Fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements. The length feels deliberate, but the story’s ambition slightly outstrips its brevity.</comment>
