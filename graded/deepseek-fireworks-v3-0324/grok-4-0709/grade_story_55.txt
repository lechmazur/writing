<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirian's motivation is clear and poetically tragic, but his "romantically doomed" aspect feels slightly overemphasized at the expense of deeper exploration of his craft obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the bell's echo serving as a clever catalyst. The urgency of the new star's birth elevates stakes effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The utopian studio's contrast with Lirian's melancholy is exquisite. Holographic skies and hidden archives create a vivid, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (keys, bell) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending satisfies, though the ghostly revelry veers close to clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the studio's concept and Lirian's method. A few phrases ("raucously silent") feel overworked, but the voice is distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, though the "forgotten revelry" tone slightly conflicts with the urgency. The brevity feels deliberate and potent.</comment>
