<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' dual nature as a ghostwriter and a subversive poet is compelling. His motivation to reclaim agency is clear, though his transition from passive to active could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the coded stanzas and sandals driving the action logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the escalation of political fallout feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground orchard and orchestra tuning are brilliantly fused into a surreal, oppressive atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing fungi, creaking leather) elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich subtext—corrosion as both weapon and liberation. Literary devices (metaphors like "storm-tossed sailor") are deftly deployed. Ending is triumphant but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The fusion of political thriller and poetic rebellion feels unique, though some phrases verge on over-polished ("chaotic notes resolving into harmony").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious story that transcends its constraints. Leaves the reader pondering power and artistry. Minor deductions for slight predictability in Elias' arc.</comment>
