<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias and Liora are compelling, with clear motivations and distinct voices. Their interactions reveal depth, though Liora's backstory could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the pottery class feels slightly contrived as a meeting point. The alliance pact resolves neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard is richly evoked, with sensory details enhancing the atmosphere. The rooftop setting and colonial town meld effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (gloves, throne) and subtext elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though some dialogue edges toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but "delightfully menacing" feels overused. The gloves and throne are fresh, but the pottery class is a weaker link.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, though the painting timeframe feels restrictive. The story lingers, but some elements strain credulity.</comment>
