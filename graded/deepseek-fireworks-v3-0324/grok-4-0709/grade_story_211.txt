<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax's descent into corruption is compelling, but his initial "lucky gambler" trait feels underutilized in the latter half. His motivation, however, is clear and tragic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot’s escalation from hope to tyranny is tightly structured, though the spin-the-bottle mechanism slightly strains logic. The pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and "unremembered future" are hauntingly rendered, with sensory details (dust, moonlight) amplifying the eerie, despairing atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Richly layered with symbolism (extinct plants as lost hope) and subtext. The ending is poignant, though Jax’s tyranny could be more sharply contrasted earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. Only minor quibble: "cheerful despair" occasionally veers toward melodrama rather than nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with all elements serving the theme. The length feels deliberate, though the spin-the-bottle conceit slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>
