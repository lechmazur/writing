<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, deeply personal, and drives the narrative. His guilt and pursuit of reconciliation are well-explored, though his wilderness guide background feels slightly underutilized in this context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from guilt to healing. The word count is well-managed, though the diary decoding could benefit from slightly more setup to avoid feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom is vividly rendered, with atmospheric details that enhance the eerie, melancholic tone. Sensory immersion is exceptional, though the "manic clarity" tone occasionally clashes with the setting's serenity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story excels in emotional resonance and symbolism (e.g., the ring, blanket). Literary devices are used effectively, though the ending's resolution borders on overly neat for such a complex emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. However, the "wilderness guide" element feels less integrated, and the manic tone occasionally distracts from deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, though some concepts (e.g., the blanket's encoding) demand more exploration.</comment>
