<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The rain trails and paperclip key logically drive the narrative forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rain, yodeling echoes) enhancing the atmosphere. The stadium's hush mirrors Elias' internal conflict beautifully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (paperclip, synthetically organic enhancements) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive, with elements serving the narrative rather than the reverse. The brief length works as a deliberate choice, leaving a lingering emotional impact.</comment>
