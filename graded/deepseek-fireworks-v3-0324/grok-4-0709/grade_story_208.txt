<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's background as a street musician and his shift to a soulless job are well-integrated, though his motivation to find humor in absurdity could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent, with the fountain pen's magic logically extending from Elias's regrets. The rewind action feels organic, though the ending resolution is slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The automated postal facility is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's melancholic yet absurd tone. Sensory details (rust, whirring machinery) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (pen as lost art) and subtext (stability vs. passion). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though the "cosmic joke" metaphor borders on overused.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "musical notations twisted into illusions"). Avoids clich√©s, though the "joyful despair" tone occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection on art and regret.</comment>
