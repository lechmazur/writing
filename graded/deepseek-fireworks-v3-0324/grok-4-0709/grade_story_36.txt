<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized, his calm doomsayer persona and inner conflict portrayed with depth and consistency. His motivation—resisting stagnation—is clear but could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the climax (train whistle catalyst) feels slightly abrupt. The arc from inertia to action is satisfying but could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details (gas lamps, brass contraptions). The workshop and sunrise setting enhance the story's melancholic yet hopeful tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (skateboard as talisman) and evocative prose. The ending resonates, though the theme of lost innocence could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "gods of stagnation"). Avoids clichés, though some phrases border on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, with the skateboard and steampunk backdrop serving the narrative. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
