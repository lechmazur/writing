<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but Elias's "conventionally rebellious" trait feels slightly underdeveloped beyond surface-level descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but relies heavily on the "glimmering transitions" device, which disrupts grounding in either setting. Pacing is well-managed, though the laundromat scene's connection to the study feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details. The giant's study and laundromat are vividly contrasted, but their thematic linkage could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flower, transitions) and subtext, but dialogue occasionally veers into pretentiousness. The ending is purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on familiar tropes (prophet, unity-through-rebellion). Some metaphors (e.g., "laundry") are fresh, while others ("fireflies") feel overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story, though the laundromat setting feels tangential. The brevity works, but the theme of unity could be more nuanced.</comment>
