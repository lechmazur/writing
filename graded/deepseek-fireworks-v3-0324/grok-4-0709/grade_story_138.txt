<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation is clear but somewhat superficial; his "hollow recklessness" feels more told than shown. His actions align, but deeper introspection would strengthen his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but rushed; the drone and ticket stubs tie together logically, though the lab's combustion feels abrupt. Pacing suffers slightly from word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lab's chaotic atmosphere enhances tension, but its connection to Eamon's past is underdeveloped. Sensory details (hissing beakers, humming air) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (stubs as betrayals, drone as truth-seeker) is strong, but the ending's "combustion of fate" feels melodramatic. Theme of illusion-cutting is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality is marred by predictable noble-recklessness tropes. Some phrases ("hollow eyes," "volatile sanctuary") verge on clich√©. Emotion lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some (lab, stubs) feel underutilized. The length suits the premise, though deeper exploration would elevate impact.</comment>
