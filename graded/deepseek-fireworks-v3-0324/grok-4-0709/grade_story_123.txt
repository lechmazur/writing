<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's gleeful moroseness is effectively integrated, but his motivation could be more nuanced. The boots reveal depth but feel slightly convenient.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the brewing resolution lacks buildup. Starlit conversations anchor the arc well but are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and lush, with sensory details enhancing decay and nostalgia. Facility and timeframe merge seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels abrupt. Theme of renewal is clear but could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original voice avoids clich√©s, though "gleefully morose" leans theatrical. Emotional resonance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some feel imposed (e.g., scuffs). Length suits the vignette, but depth is sacrificed.</comment>
