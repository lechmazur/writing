<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his transformation through the spectacles and mosaic is compelling. However, his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. The misplaced letter as a key device works but could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked with sensory details, and the setting enhances the story’s themes. The castle and seed planting season are vividly connected to Elias’s journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (spectacles, mosaic) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional resonance could be deeper. The theme of renewal is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows originality, but some phrasing ("corroded rapture") feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of emotion, though not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The elements cohere well, and the story feels deliberate. It leaves a lingering thought, though the brevity slightly limits depth.</comment>
