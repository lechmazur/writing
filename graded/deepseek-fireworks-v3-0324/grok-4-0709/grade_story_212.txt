<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his desire for freedom, but his 'voice' could be more distinct. The atypical seeds and his actions align well with his rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the connection between the bottle and the deck feels slightly abrupt. The resolution is satisfying, though the word limit constraints show.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war setting are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like the "forgotten watercolor" sky are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seeds, cards) and evocative prose. The theme of liberation is clear, though the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors (e.g., "song of boundaries"). Avoids clich√©s, though some phrases edge toward ornate without losing purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of unchained possibility.</comment>
