<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's immortality and radiation scars vividly shape his bitter resilience; his motivation to restore the garden is compelling and consistent, though his "rigidly flexible" nature could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the earbud cover and ink patterns logically driving the restoration. Pacing is strong, but the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden's quantum-meets-organic atmosphere is brilliantly evoked, with sensory details (ionized vines, synthetic mulch) deepening its eerie, fractured beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as galaxies, painted-over histories) and emotional resonance elevate the story, though the ending's irony could resonate more sharply.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of sci-fi and mythos, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "particle acceleration garden"). Minimal clich√©, though "bitter laughter" borders on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The length feels deliberate, leaving room for thematic depth without overexplanation.</comment>
