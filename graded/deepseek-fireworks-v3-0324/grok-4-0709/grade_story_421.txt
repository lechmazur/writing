<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent with her nomadic dreamer trait, but her "ferociously polite" attribute feels slightly forced in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the coin toss, but the urgency of the mission feels underdeveloped due to the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop setting and nautical wheel are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's atmospheric depth. Sensory details (lavender, lanterns) are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (wheel, orchid) and subtext (sacrifice vs. harmony) are strong, but the emotional weight of "anguished joy" isn't fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally slips into florid prose ("petals whispered secrets"). Avoids major clich√©s, though some phrasing feels overly decorative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the brevity truncates thematic exploration. The ending lingers, though the rushed setup weakens impact.</comment>
