<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is compelling but somewhat overshadowed by dense prose; his 'purposefully aimless' attribute could be explored more dynamically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but pacing suffers from verbose descriptions; the riddle's integration is clever but feels rushed in resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though the story's density demands rereading; brevity is a strength, not a constraint.</comment>
