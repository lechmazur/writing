<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prince Elandor's motivation is clear and consistent—his loneliness drives his actions. The herbalist's introduction subtly shifts his arc, revealing his vulnerability. His voice is distinct, blending regal despair with wanderer’s weariness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the storm's abrupt arrival feels slightly contrived. The connection between locking away the past and the herbalist's intervention is elegant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office is vividly rendered, with sensory details (creaking floorboards, howling wind) amplifying the atmosphere. The setting mirrors Elandor’s isolation and the "familiar unknown" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mortar/pestle as endurance) and subtext (unseen forces as fate). The ending is satisfying, though the "iconic" transformation could feel overstated. Emotion is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés, but the "unseen forces" concept edges toward contrivance. The prose is purposeful, though occasionally ornate ("dusty ledgers whispered forgotten borders"). Original handling of tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically, with the mortar/pestle and snowstorm serving the theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on exile and healing.</comment>
