<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's blunt heresy and motivation are vividly portrayed, but her "enthusiastically cautious" attribute feels slightly underdeveloped in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the stock ticker method feels abrupt and slightly contrived for the setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the stock ticker disrupts cohesion. Length feels deliberate, ending lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
