<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elaric’s meekness and sincerity are well-defined and consistent, driving his quiet, reflective pursuit of the riddle. His emotional arc is clear, but his voice lacks deeper distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to revelation. The pacing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The goblin city’s bioluminescent atmosphere is richly detailed and enhances the mystical tone. Sensory details (light, sound, texture) are immersive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., the dew drop as a prism of spirits) and thematic depth elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the epiphany could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the goblin-necromancer pairing and the dew-drop revelation. Some phrasing leans slightly generic (“chaos is the order”), but the core concept is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere beautifully, with the broken pen and playground sounds grounding the mystical theme. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste.</comment>
