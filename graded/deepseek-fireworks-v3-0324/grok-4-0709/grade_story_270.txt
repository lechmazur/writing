<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered, his cynical arrogance and motivation to harness the ephemeral are clear and intertwined, driving his actions believably. His distinct voice and tragic flaw elevate the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful, with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ending's ambiguity might frustrate some readers expecting resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—sensory details (salt, parchment, roaring waves) immerse the reader. The lighthouse and globe are deeply integrated into the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (echoes, constellations) and subtext (borrowed time, eternal limbo). The ending lingers, prompting reflection on permanence and isolation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and haunting, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Avoids clichés, but a few metaphors could feel slightly strained ("loneliness intertwined like distant stars").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements harmonize seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story’s depth transcends its length, leaving a melancholic resonance.</comment>
