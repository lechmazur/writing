<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "hopefully cynical" outlook adds depth, but his "voice" could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's action ("reap"), with logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is tight, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building excels—the diner and archive blend seamlessly. Sensory details (musty air, flickering neon) enhance atmosphere, grounding the "forgotten arts" concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (whistle as rebirth). Emotional resonance is present, though deeper subtext could elevate the theme of isolation. Ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining whistle lore with coded messages. Some descriptors verge on generic, but the core concept avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, serving the story's emotional arc. Length feels deliberate; the whistle's role is particularly inventive.</comment>
