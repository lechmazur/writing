<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amir's weary undertaker persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and alignment to his actions. His "placid ferocity" stands out as a nuanced trait, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the astronomical clock and sun paths driving the conflict logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The reimagined Persian palace is a masterclass in atmosphere, blending sensory details (celestial motifs, brass gears) with thematic depth. The setting amplifies the story's stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (symbolism of light/dark, celestial imagery) and a resonant theme of hope elevate this. The ending is satisfying, though the entity's defeat could be more textured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, ambitious tale where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on hope and heritage.</comment>
