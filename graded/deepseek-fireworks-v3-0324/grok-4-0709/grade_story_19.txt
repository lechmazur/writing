<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The feral ranger's motivation is compelling and consistent, reinforced by his actions and the symbolic use of the balance scale. His "feral" nature is well-integrated but could delve deeper into his backstory for richer development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for its length, though the connection between receipts and unfiltered perception feels slightly contrived. The arc is clear but could benefit from tighter cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dandelion field and timeframe ("newborn's first cry") create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, enhancing the melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (scale, dandelions) and layered themes (chaos vs. control) elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the receipts' role in the climax could be more impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but some phrases verge on florid ("whispered secrets," "chaotic perfection"). The concept of "precisely random" feels fresh but slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical vignette with striking imagery. The brevity feels deliberate, though deeper exploration of the ranger's past would strengthen its emotional weight.</comment>
