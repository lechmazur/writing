<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gearheart's motivation is deeply compelling, and his grotesque allure aligns perfectly with his role as a collector of lost confessions. His "exultant grief" is a masterful emotional core.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the gathering of fragments, with a clear arc from discovery to revelation. Pacing is deliberate yet immersive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and starry river create a haunting, surreal atmosphere that amplifies the story's emotional weight. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (the heart mosaic, opera glasses) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending lingers with profound melancholy and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original, avoiding clich√©s. Gearheart's duality (decay/ingenuity) and the orchard's paradox (beauty/desolation) feel fresh and deeply human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A flawless fusion of elements. The story transcends its constraints, leaving a lasting impression of sorrowful wonder.</comment>
