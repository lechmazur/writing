<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, driving his actions with a consistent intensity. His solitary nature and desire to outshine his reflection are well-integrated, though his inner conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and effectively paced, with the leaf-map and quantum beach serving as strong narrative drivers. The ending resolution feels earned, though the demolition's immediacy could be more deeply woven into Elias's arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The quantum beach and condemned lighthouse create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (shimmering haze, humming seashells) elevate the setting, though the "corroded rapture" tone occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (quantum metaphors, reflective symbolism) deepen the story. The mirror-beast is a striking invention, but its emotional resonance could be further explored. The ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "sand grains flickering between states"). The prose avoids clich√©s, though "corroded rapture" feels slightly forced. Nuanced handling of Elias's self-doubt stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, with the quantum beach and leaf-map serving the story's themes. The brevity feels deliberate, though the holiday's relevance could be sharper.</comment>
