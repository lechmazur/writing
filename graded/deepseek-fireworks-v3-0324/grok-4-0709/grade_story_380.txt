<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, anchored by his fractured identity and desperation to revive a dying world. His mathematical ineptitude adds a unique flaw, though its impact could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot's surreal logic holds together, but the soccer method feels abrupt. The arc is cohesive, though the climax's execution leans heavily on thematic resonance over grounded cause-and-effect.</comment>
