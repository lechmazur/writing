<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "rogue" nature could be more sharply defined through actions or dialogue. The amber inkwell and wine tasting method nicely reveal her archival obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coheres around Torin's arrival and Elara's method, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the closing. Cause-and-effect is logical, though the "unspoken offer" could be more sharply articulated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (glowing runes, frost-kissed evening). The longhouse and overlooked era blend well, though the "fierce repose" tone occasionally clashes with the quiet mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amber inkwell, zigzagging emotions) and subtext. Ending is purposeful, but the theme of archival vs. fleeting emotion could be deeper. Shows more than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original perspective on Viking-era mysticism, though "modestly flashy" feels slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("fierce repose") verge on over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about emotional preservation, but the wine tasting method slightly undermines gravitas.</comment>
