<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, blending logic and emotion effectively. His actions align with his backstory and traits, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the ending feels slightly abrupt. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the dead-end twist lacks setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and countdown create palpable tension. Sensory details (jasmine scent, echoing whispers) are evocative and enhance the atmosphere brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (necklace, scent) and emotional resonance, but the theme of "legacy over escape" could be more explicitly woven earlier. Ending is poignant but rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "charting a star map from tears"). Avoids clich√©s, though "grandiose modesty" feels slightly contrived. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the story slightly strains under their weight. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of tragic ambition.</comment>
