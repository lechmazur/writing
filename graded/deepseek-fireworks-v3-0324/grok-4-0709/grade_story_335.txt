<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The rumor chain method is intriguing but slightly convoluted for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cathedral setting is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (paint splatters, fading light) are used effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes strong emotion and uses symbolism (amber, spider) well. The ending is satisfying, though the hallucinatory vision feels slightly rushed.</comment>
