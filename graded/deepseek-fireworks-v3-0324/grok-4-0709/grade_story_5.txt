<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's guarded nature and motivation to preserve ancient wisdom are clear and well-integrated, though his "whimsical resolve" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the amulet's nightmares and the seashell revelation driving a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The decaying power plant is atmospheric and perfectly complements the story's themes. Sensory details (rust, humming shells) are evocative and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (amulet, shell) and subtext about hubris vs. humility. Ending is satisfying, though the "pensive mirth" tone slightly undermines gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional phrases ("theoretically whimsical") feel forced. Avoids clich√©s but dips into overly ornate prose at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, memorable whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the theme lingers after reading.</comment>
