<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Elandor's morose demeanor and bored yet persistent motivation are vividly portrayed, aligning well with his actions. His distinct "voice" and the revelation through the dull sewing needle add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the blackout and chance encounter driving momentum logically. The resolution feels earned, though the brevity slightly rushes the weaver's introduction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory's lavishly austere atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant. Sensory details (crystal chandeliers, void-fabric) heighten the cosmic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tapestry, needle) and layered themes (stasis vs. change). The ending's quiet triumph lingers, though the weaver's dialogue borders on expositional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The morose paladin trope is subverted, and the needle's enchantment feels inventive. Minor overuse of "lavishly austere."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, with the blackout and observatory serving the theme. The length feels deliberate, leaving a haunting aftertaste of cosmic revival.</comment>
