<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is clear, but his storm chaser background feels underutilized. His "eagerly unwilling" attribute adds nuance but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc, though the tapestry-to-carousel pivot feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alpine monastery setting is vivid and enhances the story's atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "snow-capped peaks," "high-altitude chill") are well-chosen.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tapestry as blueprint, carousel as renewal), but the theme of "inner strength" could be sharper. Ending is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans on "nostalgic innovation" somewhat predictably. Some metaphors (e.g., "forgotten prayer") verge on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. The carousel restoration is inventive, but the storm chaser premise feels secondary.</comment>
