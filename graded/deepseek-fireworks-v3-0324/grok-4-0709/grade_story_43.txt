<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The character's "loudly introverted" trait is vividly portrayed, and their motivation to reunite with courage is clear, though their actions could be more dynamically aligned with their inner turmoil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot has a strong thematic arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the resolution. Cause-and-effect is logical, though the climax could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and post-narrative atmosphere are stunningly evoked, with sensory details (fog, fireflies) deeply enhancing the mood. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and literary craft elevate the story, though the ending's emotional punch could be sharper. Theme of courage is resonant but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "crooked hope"). Minimal clich√©s, though the "CD as relic" trope skirts familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, with elements serving the story well. The brief length feels intentional, leaving room for reflection.</comment>
