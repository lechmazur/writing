<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias' cynically hopeful nature is well-developed and consistent, driving his actions and interactions believably. His "voice" stands out, especially in dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, though the speed-dating event feels slightly contrived as a catalyst. Cause-and-effect logic holds.</comment>
