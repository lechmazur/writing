<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's meddlesome nature and hidden agenda are clear, but her motivation to decode symbols feels slightly abrupt. Her manipulation is well-aligned with her traits, though more depth in her backstory would enrich her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically, with the skates and method driving the action. The ending feels purposeful, but the word limit restricts fuller development of Dr. Harlan's weakening resolve.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward create a striking atmosphere. Sensory details enhance the eerie mood, though the connection between skates and setting could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (footprints, skates) and subtext. The ending lingers, but some metaphors verge on overworked. Dialogue is purposeful, though sparse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasional AI-like phrasing ("lucid confusion"). Emotional nuance is shown, not told, though Elara's motives could feel less algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, but the storyâ€™s brevity highlights constraints. The skates and beach vision are inventive, yet the ending slightly rushes the thematic payoff.</comment>
