<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from problem to resolution. The time-skip mechanic amplifies the climax, though the vine ladder's abrupt closure feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The treehouse city is vividly rendered, blending atmosphere with action. Sensory details (creaking bridges, humid air) deepen immersion, though the poltergeist's laughter could be more evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the grimoire as "an old warrior's hide") enrich subtext. The ending satisfies, but the theme of legacy could be further layered beyond surface triumph.</comment>
