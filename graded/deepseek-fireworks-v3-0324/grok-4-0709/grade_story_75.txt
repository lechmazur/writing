<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael's guarded nature and skeptically credulous trait are well-integrated, driving her actions and decisions. Her motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear and fuels her arc, though her transition to unyielding belief feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and driven by the decryption action, but the tight word limit forces some compression—the grassroots movement's role could be fleshed out more organically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest is vividly rendered with bioluminescent details, and the setting enhances the story's uniqueness. The timeframe's connection to the vows is poignant but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance and use of symbolism (vows as manifesto) are strong, though the "angry peace" tone occasionally veers into abstraction. Literary devices are employed effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the nano-forest and decrypting method, but some phrases edge toward flowery prose. The theme of grassroots revival avoids cliché through fresh execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and cohesive, with elements serving its core theme. The brevity works, though a touch more space for emotional nuance would elevate it further.</comment>
