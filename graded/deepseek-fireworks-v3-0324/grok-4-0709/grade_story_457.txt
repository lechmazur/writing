<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "impersonally personal" demeanor could be deeper. His method of analyzing folklore contradictions effectively reveals his personality and shapes his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but leans heavily on exposition. The broken zipper pull drives the climax well, though the pacing feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nebula observation deck is vividly rendered, and its ethereal atmosphere enhances the theme. The contrast between the sterile city and the dreamlike deck is a standout strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements. The brief length works, but the conclusion could linger more.</comment>
