<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias' transformation from city planner to prepper is compelling, but his "rarely authentic" attribute feels underdeveloped. His moment of realization is strong, though.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but slightly rushed. The handshake revelation is effective, but the transition from doubt to freedom could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with vivid sensory details (incense, monsoon rains). Temple setting enhances the tension but slightly overshadows the ink blotter's role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (broken constellations, ink blotter). Ending is satisfying but could linger more on Elias' emotional shift.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors. Some phrasing leans flowery, but the core idea avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements. Length feels deliberate, but the temple's dominance slightly unbalances the story.</comment>
