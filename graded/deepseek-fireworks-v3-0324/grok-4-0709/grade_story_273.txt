<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elandor's motivation and aristocratic disguise are well-integrated, but his "strangely honest" attribute could be more deeply explored to avoid occasional tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and tightly structured, though the resolution of the Weaver's subjugation feels slightly rushed. Pacing otherwise excels within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The swamp fortress and primordial void are vividly rendered, with sensory details (ethereal gondolas, gnarled vines) elevating the atmosphere. A near-perfect fusion of setting and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (yarn as suppressed narratives) and a resonant theme of defiance through truth make this memorable. Minor deduction for occasional over-reliance on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "time hung like unspun threads") and subversion of tropes. Only a hint of formulaic phrasing in the climax.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Lingers on the power of storytelling, leaving thematic depth beyond the plot.</comment>
