<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's muteness and unassumingly bold nature are compelling, but his motivation to find hidden meanings could be more nuanced. His actions align well with his traits, though deeper introspection would elevate this further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the comet's guidance and the mind's escape concept driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opera house and storm-battered harbor create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (snow, cracked skylights) enhance the mood brilliantly, though the harbor's metaphor could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (comets as heralds, snow as veils) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is purposeful, but the theme of "hidden meanings" could be more subtly woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concepts (interdimensional travel via comet) stand out, but some phrasing leans flowery. The narrative avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels overly precise in descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though a stronger emotional punch would make it exceptional.</comment>
