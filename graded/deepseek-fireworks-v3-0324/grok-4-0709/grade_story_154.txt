<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bran's "strongly weak" attribute is compelling and drives his actions well. His motivation to track social changes is clear, though his manic reactions occasionally feel exaggerated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent but slightly rushed in the glade scene. The "strands of courage" concept ties the arc together, but the levitation resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The bioluminescent oaks and digital vines create a memorable, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ink pot, strands) and emotional contrast ("jubilant despair"). The ending is poignant but could linger more on thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of myth and tech, avoiding clichés. Some phrases ("jubilant despair") risk overuse, but the voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, though the "urban legends" method feels underdeveloped. The story’s brevity works to its advantage, leaving a lingering impression.</comment>
