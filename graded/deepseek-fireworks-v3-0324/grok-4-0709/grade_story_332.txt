<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "fiercely gentle" attribute could be more consistently shown in actions beyond his hands. His voice is distinct but occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the leap to "realms of surprise" feels abrupt. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though the resolution leans too heavily on mystical intervention.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered with sensory richness, though the "borrowed books" timeframe feels underutilized. Atmosphere and setting elevate the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext, but the endingâ€™s emotional payoff relies on contrivance. Literary devices are effective, though the theme of loss could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original but occasionally overwrought ("crystalline vines," "cosmic storms"). Avoids tropes but risks purple prose. Emotional resonance is genuine but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, though the "stage curtains" metaphor feels forced. The length suits the narrative, and the story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
