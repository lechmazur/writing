<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's grumpy yet compassionate nature is well-developed and drives his actions believably. His accidental mayoralty adds depth, though his transformation could use slightly more foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The beetle's discovery and Elias's metamorphosis are logical but slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swamp orchard's polluted, mystical atmosphere is vividly rendered, enhancing the story's tone. Sensory details (toxic mists, shimmering pools) are particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (beetle as purifier) and subtext (fate vs. choice). The ending is satisfying, though the themes could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding and fresh metaphors (e.g., "tents folding like weary butterflies"). Avoids clich√©s, though the grumpy-to-hero arc is familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, inventive story where elements serve the narrative. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impression of transformation.</comment>
