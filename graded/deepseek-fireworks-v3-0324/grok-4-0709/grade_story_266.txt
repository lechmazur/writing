<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Janko's motivation is vivid and consistently woven into his actions; his "jagged generosity" and fixation on the clock hand reveal depth. However, his clown identity occasionally feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is cohesive, with the spinning clock hand driving Janko's transformation. Some transitions between concepts (e.g., promises to poetry) could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating studio and aurora-kissed horizon create a hauntingly evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked greasepaint, cloud-woven mats) are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., the clock hand as symbolism) resonate strongly, and the ending delivers emotional impact. Minor pacing issues in the middle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the absurdist premise and Janko's voice. A few phrases verge on overly ornate ("ethereal haze of dawn").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a striking whole, though the floating studio's purpose feels slightly underexplored. Leaves a lingering melancholy.</comment>
