<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underachieving mage's motivation is clear (reclaiming heritage), and their apathy-turned-excitement arc is engaging. However, their "exceptionally usual" trait feels underexplored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and tightly paced, with misdelivered packages driving the arc. The connection between the doll, crystals, and journals is clever but slightly rushed in resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>World-building is vivid—blended magic/tech and sensory details (grime, static) elevate the abandoned station. The farmland's looming sale adds urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth (self-imposed limitations, legacy) and evocative imagery (doll's eyes, glowing wards). Ending is satisfying but could linger more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original blend of sci-fi and magic avoids clichés. "Bored excitement" tone is fresh, though the mage's epiphany leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story. Tight word count feels deliberate, with creative use of packages and relics to unlock heritage.</comment>
