<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' background as a seismologist turned cook is compelling, and his motivation to expose the conspiracy is clear and consistent. His actions align well with his established traits, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect relationships. The use of the walking stick and eraser drives the narrative effectively, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and immersive, with vivid sensory details and a setting that enhances the story's tension. The dust-laden facility and eerie seismographs deepen the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds in evoking intrigue and thought, with strong symbolism (e.g., dust as layers of deception). The ending is satisfying, though the central conflict could be more explicitly resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and feels original, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "dust like tree rings of history"). Emotions are shown subtly, though some phrasing borders on overly ornate.</comment>
