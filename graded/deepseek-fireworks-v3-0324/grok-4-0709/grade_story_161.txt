<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's backstory and motivation are vividly drawn, with his trauma and sardonic resilience deeply influencing his actions. The "never tardy" trait feels slightly underutilized but serves his vigilant nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed, with the conspiracy unraveling logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the climax could linger slightly more for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and thematically rich—the facility's contrasts (delicate vs. sinister) mirror Elias's arc. Sensory details (fluorescent lights, fluttering debris) deepen the tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (peacock motifs, scorched earth) and sardonic voice. Ending is satisfying yet leaves room for reflection on resilience. Dialogue is sparse but sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The peacock-tail metaphor is inventive, though the "never tardy" trait feels slightly contrived. Emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive; elements serve the story organically. The brief length feels deliberate, with lingering thematic resonance (tragedy transformed into purpose).</comment>
