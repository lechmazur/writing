<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldrin's skepticism and minstrel background are well-integrated, driving his actions and reactions. His motivation to out-scheme Malaphar is clear and consistent, though his "reckless generosity" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The slingshot trap is inventive, and the resolution feels earned. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the ink factory's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The factory's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (rust, steam, ink) enhancing the mood. The midday silence contrasts effectively with the lurking trickster threat.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and subtext (e.g., vanishing ink as metaphor for Malaphar's fate). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of skepticism vs. magic could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The dragon-scale armor and ink factory are inventive. Tone shifts slightly between irreverence and awe but remains engaging.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of skepticism and the nature of trickery.</comment>
