<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and poignant, blending hope and sorrow effectively. His actions align with his cleverly naive optimism, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the maze's riddles could be more explicitly tied to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>World-building is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (flickering streetlamp, humming trees) enhancing the mystic atmosphere. The orchard and machine are brilliantly interconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (jigsaw edge, silver fruit) and emotional depth elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the theme of "reclaiming" could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The prose is purposeful, though a few phrases ("agonizing bliss") verge on overused. Nuanced handling of emotion stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story organically. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope and renewal.</comment>
