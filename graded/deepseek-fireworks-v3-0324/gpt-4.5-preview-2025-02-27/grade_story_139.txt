<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's stubbornness and obsession are well-developed, driving his actions and revelations. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his "dark reflection" could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the gondola's role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded mountains and gondola create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (creaking cables, thin air) enhance the mood, though the "cautious enchantment" could be more concretely shown.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (flute, reflection) and subtext (self-forgiveness). The ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, with strong literary craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The twist (self-bitten flute) is fresh, though the "dark reflection" trope leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story. Leaves a lingering thought about self-awareness and forgiveness.</comment>
