<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's socially awkward inventor persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His interaction with the whistle reveals depth, though his "hopefully cynical" attribute could be more subtly integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the encrypted archive and whistle crafting driving the narrative logically. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night atmosphere enhance the story's mood, though sensory details could be more vivid. The connection between the whistle and the setting is meaningful but slightly understated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (whistle as key to regret) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, and the dialogue feels natural. The theme of reclaiming authenticity is effectively conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though some phrases verge on overly poetic. Emotional resonance is achieved through showing rather than telling. The narrative avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of hope and reflection.</comment>
