<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's outcast status and scholarly nature are well-integrated, but his motivation to prove midnight's transience feels slightly abstract. His reactions to the seashell and diaries reveal depth, though his "frantic peace" could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect logic. The diaries and seashell drive the narrative effectively, and the resolution feels earned. Pacing is strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's flying carpet garage is vividly rendered, and the half-lit corridor enhances the atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., hovering carpets, humming shell) immerse the reader. The setting amplifies the story's mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (shell as mirror, midnight as illusion) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of self-discovery resonates. Shows rather than tells emotions effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The seashell's role and the garage setting are inventive. Emotional nuance is present, though "frantic peace" borders on contrived. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive whole. The brief length feels deliberate, and the story lingers with thematic depth. Creative combination of mystical and introspective elements.</comment>
