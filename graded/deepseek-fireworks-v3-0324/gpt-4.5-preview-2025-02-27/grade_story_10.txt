<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His internal conflict and regret are palpable, though his "cheerless" nature could be more vividly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from regret to resolution. Pacing is strong, though the climax (opening the chest) could be slightly more impactful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and humming servers create a haunting, evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (maggots, cold metal) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional storytelling with rich symbolism (chest as decay, sword as ambition). The ending is poignant and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The elasticized blade and mutated recipes are inventive, though the "bittersweet reckoning" tone leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, impactful story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional weight.</comment>
