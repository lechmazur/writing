<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from fainthearted to determined is clear, but his "sentinel" role feels underdeveloped. His motivation is consistent, though his initial hesitation could be more vividly contrasted with his later resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the transition from dog-walking to the chamber feels abrupt. The ruler's role is intriguing but could be more tightly woven into the early setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory details (tapestries, candlelight). The chamber's "intimately distant" quality is evocative, though the plastic ruler's mundanity clashes slightly with the ancient setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (tapestry as knowledge) and subtext (illusion vs. truth). The ending is satisfying, but the voice could be more distinct to elevate emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept, but the "fainthearted sentinel" trope leans generic. The ruler's symbolism is fresh, though the dog's role feels slightly contrived for emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements. The brevity works, but the dog-walking frame could be more organically tied to the chamber's discovery.</comment>
