<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply personal, but his "secretive pathfinder" trait feels underdeveloped. His actions align well with his goal, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, but the hacking method feels abrupt. The ghost train's role in the climax is strong, though the marathon's connection to folk medicine could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The ghost train and carousel are used effectively, but the park's spectral inhabitants could be more integrated earlier.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance is strong, particularly in the reunion with Elias's grandmother. Symbolism (e.g., the teapot) is well-handled, but the hacking subplot lacks subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "breathing angrily peaceful"). Avoids clich√©s, though the playlist hack leans slightly gimmicky. The tone is consistent and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements serving the story rather than vice versa. The brevity feels deliberate, and the ending lingers. A few contrivances (hacking) hold it back from perfection.</comment>
