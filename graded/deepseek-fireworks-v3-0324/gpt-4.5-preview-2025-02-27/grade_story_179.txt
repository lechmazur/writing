<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His envy and longing are subtly portrayed, and his "forcibly gentle" resolve adds depth. However, his transition to self-awareness could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ruler investigation drives the story effectively, though the resolution with Mira feels slightly rushed.</comment>
