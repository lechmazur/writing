<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and deeply tied to her heritage, but her "feral" nature feels underdeveloped beyond her nomadic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with the bookmark and ink serving as elegant vehicles for the central conflict. Pacing is strong, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The factory and sky are vividly rendered, with sensory details (e.g., the leaf's whisper) enhancing the ethereal atmosphere. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ink as lost music) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending lingers, though the theme of preservation could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "effortlessly complicated" and "blithe discontent" verge on overwrought. The core concept, however, feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that justifies its brevity. The factory and bookmark are seamlessly integrated, leaving a resonant impression.</comment>
