<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Percival's submissive nature and perceptiveness are well-integrated, driving his actions believably. His motivation to protect the fox aligns with his empathetic trait, though his "earnest flippancy" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the secret agent workshop feels abrupt. The climax with the letter opener is clever but slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The garden and woods are evocatively described, but the workshop's atmosphere clashes with the otherwise grounded setting. Sensory details are strong but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (fox as vulnerability) and subtext (quiet strength). The ending is satisfying, though the "earnest flippancy" tone occasionally disrupts emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on aristocratic tropes. The letter opener and echo chambers are fresh, but some phrasing ("liquifying into whispers") feels overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the story cohesively, and the length feels deliberate. The fox's rescue lingers, though the workshop subplot detracts slightly.</comment>
