<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's "confidently unsure" attribute is well-integrated, revealing depth through his paradoxical state and weary persistence. His motivation is clear but could benefit from more explicit internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. The kaleidoscope and card tie together thematically, though the transition between memories and present action could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting and "hush after the final siren" timeframe create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (shattered glass, worn card) are evocative, though the intact painting's symbolism feels slightly overplayed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (kaleidoscope, card) and subtext (rigged justice). The ending is purposeful but could linger more emotionally. Style enhances the story, though some metaphors border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "dance partner he desperately wished to outstep"), but occasional clich√©s ("altar of duty"). Nuanced emotion, though sarcasm sometimes overshadows deeper vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, with the kaleidoscope and card enriching theme. The brevity feels deliberate, though the detective archetype leans familiar. Leaves a resonant, if slightly muted, impression.</comment>
