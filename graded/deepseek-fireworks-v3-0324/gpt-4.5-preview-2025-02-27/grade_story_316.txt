<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Theo's ribbon and the scoreboard serving as elegant pivots. Pacing is masterful for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple's transformation into a sanctuary is vividly rendered, with sensory details (faded silk, flickering scoreboard) enhancing the melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, though "seraphic" and "scattered harmony" verge on over-poeticism. Avoids clich√©s deftly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, deeply felt story where every element serves the whole. The brevity feels intentional and potent.</comment>
