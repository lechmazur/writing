<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear and consistent, with his "clumsily dexterous" hands and sound engineer background shaping his unique approach to silence. His admiration for pantomime performers adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the stained glass fragment and cauldron room serving as logical tools for Elias' silent retribution. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and muted colors from the stained glass create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (soundless energy, ethereal glow) enhance the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (stained glass as dissolved sound) and subtext (silence as critique) elevate the story. The ending is poignant, leaving a lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The blend of sound engineering and witchcraft feels inventive, though some phrases ("tangible mist") edge toward overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements coalesce seamlessly. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind due to its thematic depth and unique execution.</comment>
