<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's indifference is well-integrated, but his sudden stirring feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear, though his transition from indifference to resolve could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The ribbon's role as a guide is effective, though the covenant's specifics could be slightly more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The catacombs and cathedral setting is vividly rendered, enhancing the mystic tone. Sensory details (earth, incense, moonlight) are used masterfully to immerse the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's symbolism (ribbon, ember, blade) is potent, and the ending is satisfying. The dialogue is sparse but purposeful. The theme of binding past and present is compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though Elias's indifference borders on clich√©. The ribbon and covenant concept feels fresh, but some phrases ("whispering haw") verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. The brevity works, leaving a lingering sense of quiet resolve and mystery.</comment>
