<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's delicate yet fierce nature is well-developed, and her motivation to bring hope is clear and consistent. Her cynicism adds depth, though her 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the cameo's secret, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swamp setting is vividly rendered, with fireflies and mist enhancing the atmosphere. Sensory details immerse the reader, though the "line nobody wants to cross" feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cameo, fireflies) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, but some themes could be deeper. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, though the "peaceful frenzy" tone occasionally feels forced. Nuanced handling of emotion, but some descriptors are overly precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of legacy and purpose.</comment>
