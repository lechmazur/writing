<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's gentle swordsmanship and late-bloomer nature are well-integrated, but his motivation to "cradle the universe" feels slightly abstract, though thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with clear cause-and-effect, though the sundial puzzle's resolution could be more detailed. Pacing is excellent for the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though "faithfully unfaithful" leans slightly clich√©. The prose avoids purple tendencies but could sharpen a few metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully, with the short length feeling deliberate. The story lingers, offering depth beyond its plot.</comment>
