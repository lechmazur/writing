<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her astral projection and survival skills deeply influencing her actions. Her compassion adds depth, though her "sometimes always" trait feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by urgency, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect relationships are logical, though the shadowy figures' retreat could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing tension and symbolism. Sensory details (cool key, rusted rails) immerse the reader, though the timeframe's specificity feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brass key) and emotional resonance, but the ending's empathy-for-shadows theme leans slightly didactic. Literary craft is polished, with effective "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the astral premise, but "practiced spontaneity" and "sometimes always" verge on contrived. Nuanced emotion saves it from feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, though the setting and key overshadow others. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering question about the shadows' nature.</comment>
