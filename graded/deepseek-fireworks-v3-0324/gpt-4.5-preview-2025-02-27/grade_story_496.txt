<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's repressed poet persona is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent reactions. Her internal struggle and eventual release of poetry are compelling, though her terror could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from doubt to confrontation to resolution. The ambush and poetic release are logical and impactful, though the transition to the side road feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The overgrown street and moonlight create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (jasmine, cracked pavement) enhance mood and symbolism, though the corridor's silence could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (perfume bottle as repressed creativity) and subtext. The ending is satisfying, with layered themes of fear and self-expression. Literary devices elevate the prose without excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The cosmic verse concept is fresh, though the "knowing naivety" tone occasionally feels forced. Emotional resonance is strong but not flawless.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story's depth. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering impact. Creative combination of themes and setting.</comment>
