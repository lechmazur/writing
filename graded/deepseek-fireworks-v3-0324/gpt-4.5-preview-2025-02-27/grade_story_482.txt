<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and grief are vividly portrayed, driving his actions and artistic process with emotional depth. His motivation to confront his past is clear and consistent, though his "frolicsome regret" could be more sharply defined.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven, with a clear arc from avoidance to acceptance. The pacing is excellent, and the connection between the bullet hole and Elias's guilt is a strong causal thread.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The enchanted forest and arboreal workshop are richly immersive, blending fantasy and melancholy. Sensory details (e.g., morning mist, silver glow) enhance the atmosphere, though the classroom setting feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (bullet hole, painted smiles) and subtext. The ending is poignant and thematically resonant, with a style that balances lyricism and clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The "frolicsome regret" tone is fresh, and the emotional nuance feels authentic. Only minor quibbles: the wizard's hat could feel less whimsical for such a heavy theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering impact. The theme of hidden pain in art is powerfully explored.</comment>
