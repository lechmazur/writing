<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's ethically questionable pursuit of cosmic wonder is compelling and consistent, though his "numb fascination" could be more deeply explored to enhance his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the mug's codes, but the jazz age capsule feels underutilized, and the ending's abruptness slightly undermines the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (candlelight, cracked gloves) elevating the eerie, cosmic tension. The jazz age setting, however, lacks deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (knitting as rebellion) and subtext, though the theme of "breaking expectations" could be more nuanced. The ending lingers but feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, avoiding clich√©s. The cosmic horror twist feels fresh, though the jazz age spirits verge on tropiness without full subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, but the jazz age capsule and knitting timeframe feel more imposed than organic. The cosmic wonder theme resonates powerfully.</comment>
