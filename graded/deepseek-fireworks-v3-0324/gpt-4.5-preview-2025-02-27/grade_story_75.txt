<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's guarded nature and skeptical credulity are well-developed, driving his actions and emotional arc. His motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear and consistent, though his "minstrel" role feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the decrypting of vows feels abrupt. Pacing is strong, though the nano-forest's role in the resolution could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nano-forest is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the story's mood. The setting and object (bookmark) are meaningfully connected, though the "microscopic" scale occasionally distracts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism, subtext) are used effectively, and the theme of quiet rebellion resonates. The ending is purposeful, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality is high, with fresh metaphors and nuanced emotion. The story avoids clich√©s, though the "angry peace" tone occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brief length feels deliberate. The story lingers with thematic depth, though the nano-forest's significance could be sharper.</comment>
