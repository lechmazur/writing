<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's even-tempered yet rebellious nature is well-developed, and his motivation to preserve ancient hunting techniques is clear and consistent. The scarf and letter reveal depth, but his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's actions, with a clear arc. Pacing is effective, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood and action. Sensory details are evocative, though the timeframe could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (scarf, stars) and subtext. The ending is purposeful, but the conflict could be sharper. Emotional resonance is achieved through showing rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "vibrations of intent" concept is fresh, though some phrases verge on overly ornate. Nuanced handling of emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of melancholy and purpose. Style supports clarity without feeling constrained.</comment>
