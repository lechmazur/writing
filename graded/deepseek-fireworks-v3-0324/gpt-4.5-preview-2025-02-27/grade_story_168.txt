<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's ruthless precision and intellectual spontaneity are well-integrated into her actions and dialogue, though her "flower arranger" aspect feels slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by curiosity, but the connection between the singer's verses and the stone circle feels tenuous. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stone circle and twilight atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the mystery. Sensory details (e.g., weathered symbols, comb's polish) deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext (e.g., flowers as language) are compelling, but the ending's clarity slightly overrides subtlety. Dialogue is purposeful and natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original voice and fresh metaphors (e.g., "polite anarchy") avoid clich√©s. Nuanced emotions are shown, not told, though some phrasing leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>
