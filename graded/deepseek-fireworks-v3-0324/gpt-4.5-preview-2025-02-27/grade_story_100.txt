<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed as a vivid dreamer, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His "rationally mischievous" nature is subtly but effectively shown, and his use of the pressed penny collection reveals depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from curiosity to revelation. The pacing is excellent, and the cause-and-effect logic is seamless despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "silver moon paths," "gnarled apple tree") enhance the dreamlike tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (pressed penny as a key, the reflection as self-confrontation) and evocative prose elevate the story. The ending is satisfying yet open-ended, prompting reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of dream logic and emotional nuance feels authentically human, not algorithmic. Language is purposeful, not overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels deliberate, and the story lingers in the mind.</comment>
