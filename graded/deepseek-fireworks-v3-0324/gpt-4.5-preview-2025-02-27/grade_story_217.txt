<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's character is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. Her "underestimated rebel" trait and "sadly joyful" attribute are effectively woven into her decisions and interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The call and haunted house setting drive the story forward logically, though the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly atmospheric, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details like the Thai food aroma and cobwebbed mirrors immerse the reader effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story employs strong symbolism (pocket knives, cuisine) and evokes emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, though some thematic depth feels slightly underexplored due to brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clich√©s and shows originality, but a few phrases ("ephemeral gloom") verge on overused. Emotional nuance is handled well, though not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative rather than vice versa. It leaves a lingering emotional impact, suggesting depth beyond the surface.</comment>
