<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla's sass and academic mischief are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, though her arrogance could be more subtly shown rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with Marla's actions driving the chaos logically. The pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sterile office and twilight setting enhance the atmosphere, with sensory details (dust, whispers) deepening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich subtext about order vs. chaos, vivid imagery (polaroids, fractures), and a satisfying, thematic ending elevate the storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "spiderwebbing cracks"). Minimal clich√©s, though "drifted arrogance" feels slightly overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce seamlessly into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative. The brevity feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
