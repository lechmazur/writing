<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply tied to his heritage, but his "philosophically practical" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated through actions rather than dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the dice and tapestry driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly immersive, blending sci-fi and mystical elements seamlessly. Sensory details (e.g., the dice's glow, the tapestry's texture) enhance the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, tapestry) and subtext (tradition vs. survival). The ending is satisfying, though the theme could be subtly reinforced earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The fusion of space piracy and agrarian mysticism is inventive, though the "sacred disorder" tone occasionally clashes with the solemnity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, with elements serving the story elegantly. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
