<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed, with clear motivation and a distinct voice. His isolation and resourcefulness are consistently portrayed, though his "astute hermit" trait could be more explicitly shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. The pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the bread scent's introduction feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern cathedral is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere. The phosphorescent flora and fungi are brilliantly integrated, though the elevator's role is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (scissor, fungi) and emotional resonance. The ending is satisfying, and the theme of isolation is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The despairing humor and "strangely effective" motif are fresh, though the bread scent's explanation leans slightly toward contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering impact, though the elevator's narrative purpose could be stronger.</comment>
