<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, but his shift from apathy to empathy feels slightly abrupt. His "meticulously impulsive" nature is intriguing but could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc, though the anesthesia method stretches believability. Pacing is excellent, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The drought prediction center is an odd but interesting contrast to the emotional core. Sensory details are vivid, but the setting's connection to the theme could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (butterfly, lullaby) and subtext. The ending is poignant and lingers. Writing style elevates the emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The emotional nuance is subtle and effective. Only minor quibbles with phrasing ("enthusiastic apathy" feels slightly forced).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and deeply resonant. The elements serve the story beautifully, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
