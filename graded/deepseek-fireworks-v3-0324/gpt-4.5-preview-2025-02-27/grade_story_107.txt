<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur's background as a game show host adds depth, but his transition to wisdom-seeker feels slightly abrupt. Mira's introduction is strong but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect. The sabotage twist elevates the narrative, though the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (insect symphony, bitter honey) create a rich atmosphere. The island's deceptive beauty is masterfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (crystal ball, typewriter) and subtext (redemption). Ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (bitter honey sincerity). Avoids clich√©s, though the saboteur's backstory leans slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving room for reflection on wisdom and redemption.</comment>
