<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his "smiling saboteur" persona and quest for progress through imperfection well-integrated. His actions and reactions reveal depth, though his "voice" could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's study and climactic channeling of the star's wrath. Pacing is effective, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with decay and suspension enhancing the theme. Sensory details (rust, whispers, storm) immerse the reader, though some descriptions border on overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flashlight, mannequins) and subtext about imperfection. The ending is purposeful, but the emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of celestial fury and decay, though some phrases ("angry peace") feel slightly forced. Avoids clich√©s but leans on atmospheric tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with the flashlight and mannequins serving the theme. The length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about societal flaws.</comment>
