<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's sharp-witted dancer persona and linguistic ineptitude are well-integrated, driving her actions and internal conflict. Her motivation to confront the prophecy is clear, though her transition from denial to acceptance could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the prophecy and mimicry driving the narrative. The resolution feels earned, though the chamber's role could be more explicitly tied to the prophecy earlier.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thought experiment chamber and bubble bath setting create a vivid atmosphere, but the chamber's sterility clashes slightly with the story's mystical tone. Sensory details are strong but could be more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story excels in symbolism (patch, mirrors) and subtext, with a satisfying ending. The dance-as-mimicry device is particularly effective, though some emotional beats could be shown more subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and authentic, with fresh metaphors and minimal clich√©s. The handling of denial and linguistic struggle feels human, though the prophecy's wording could be less generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the story well. The brevity works, leaving a lingering impact. The family photo tradition feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
