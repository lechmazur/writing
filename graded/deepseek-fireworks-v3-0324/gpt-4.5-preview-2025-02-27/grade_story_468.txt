<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mortimer's curiosity and reverence are well-balanced, but his "polite anarchy" could be more explicitly explored to deepen his distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows organically, with the bracelet and footprints serving as elegant catalysts. Pacing is tight yet unhurried, though the spirit's abrupt appearance slightly disrupts coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a hauntingly vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "golden embers," "rustling leaves") are masterfully deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bracelet as a bridge between worlds) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending resonates, though the theme of "polite anarchy" could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but "loudly serene" and "rustle of revelation" verge on over-poeticism. Mortimer's emotional nuance saves it from feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, haunting tale that lingers. The elements serve the story, though the mangrove labyrinth's sacredness could be more integral to the conflict.</comment>
