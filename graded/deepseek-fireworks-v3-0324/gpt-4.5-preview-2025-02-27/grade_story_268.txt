<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's subdued vigilante nature is well-developed, with clear motivation and consistent actions. His use of the wooden bead and mirror method reveals depth, though his "artfully clumsy" attribute could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Elias's method, but the tight word limit slightly rushes the resolution. Cause-and-effect logic holds, though pacing feels abrupt near the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" atmosphere are vividly rendered, enhancing the story's mood. Sensory details (rust, decay, holograms) are particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, bead) and subtext about war's toll. The ending is purposeful, though the emotional impact could be deeper. Writing style elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (funhouse mirror). Minor AI-like phrasing ("screaming silence" repetition). Avoids clich√©s but occasionally over-explains emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering thought about truth and war. Creative integration of assigned components.</comment>
