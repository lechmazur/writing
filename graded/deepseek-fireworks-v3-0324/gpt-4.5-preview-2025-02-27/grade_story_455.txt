<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's disgruntled nature and decades-long role as a wishing-well attendant are well-developed, but his shift to "intensely relaxed" feels slightly abrupt. His motivation to confront past judgments is clear but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from avoidance to resolution. The tunnel discovery is a strong pivot, though the secret agent escape route feels slightly out of place.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details (damp earth, phosphorescent moss). The setting enhances the mood, though the escape route slightly disrupts the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (coins as scars, shadows as ghosts) and subtext. The ending is satisfying and resonant, with strong thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The handling of emotion is nuanced, though the "intensely relaxed" descriptor feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative integration of elements. Leaves a lingering sense of closure and reflection.</comment>
