<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and deeply intertwined with the damaged CD, revealing vulnerability and resilience. His "loudly introverted" nature is subtly shown through actions and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the CD and cathedral serving as logical anchors. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, and the resolution feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The neon cathedral is vividly rendered, with sensory details (fireflies, fog, pulsing lights) amplifying the mood. The setting elevates the story's thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (CD as humanity's relic, neon saints) and a hauntingly hopeful ending create lasting impact. The prose avoids excess while remaining evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, though a few phrases ("crooked hope") flirt with overused lyricism. The handling of solitude and courage feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a resonant whole. The brevity serves the storyâ€™s meditative tone, and the theme lingers.</comment>
