<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's glamorous undertaker persona and her deep reverence for tradition are well-integrated, though her "fruitlessly patient" attribute could be more vividly demonstrated in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the social network archive feels underutilized as a driving force. Pacing is strong, though the word limit slightly rushes the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evoked, with sensory details (polished brass, lavender paint) enhancing the mood. The setting and timeframe harmonize well, though the digital archive slightly clashes with the tactile world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (symbolism of the measuring tape, lavender as defiance) are effective, and the theme of memory vs. oblivion resonates. The ending is satisfying but could linger more emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the juxtaposition of glamour and mortality, though "jubilant remorse" risks feeling contrived. The prose avoids clichés but occasionally leans ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering reflection on tradition’s fragility, though the digital aspect feels slightly tacked on.</comment>
