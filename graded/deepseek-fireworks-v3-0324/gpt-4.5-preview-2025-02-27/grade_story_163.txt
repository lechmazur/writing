<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her actions align with her "bitterly optimistic" outlook, but her backstory as a "lost heiress" feels underdeveloped and slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the detour-to-overlook transition feels contrived. Pacing is effective within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, and the atmosphere enhances the theme of fragmented reality. A standout strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (parking stub, clouds) and subtext, but the emotional resonance could be deeper. The ending is satisfying but slightly predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in its blending of sci-fi and introspection, but some phrases verge on flowery. The "lost heiress" trope feels under-subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, and the brevity feels deliberate. Leaves a lingering question about identity, though the execution isn't flawless.</comment>
