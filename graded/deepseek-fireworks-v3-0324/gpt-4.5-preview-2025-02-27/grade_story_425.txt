<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Edrin's melancholy and purposelessness are well-conveyed, but his shift to excitement feels slightly abrupt. Lira's quiet determination is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed in the resolution. The blackout as a catalyst works, but the tapestry's restoration could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with strong sensory details. The contrast between darkness and renewed light enhances the story's mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and emotion, with effective symbolism (tapestry, needle). The ending is satisfying, though the theme of restoration could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("lavishly austere") feel overly crafted. The emotional nuance is strong, though Edrin's reasoning borders on overly logical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The length feels deliberate, but the ending could linger more.</comment>
