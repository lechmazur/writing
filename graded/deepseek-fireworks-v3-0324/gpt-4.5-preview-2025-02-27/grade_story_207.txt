<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his past and redemption arc well-integrated. His "meekly assertive" nature could be more vividly shown in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and paced well for the word limit, but the gossip-column method feels slightly contrived as a key driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station and "joyful loneliness" tone are evocatively rendered, though the "universe's secret song" is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (the bouquet) and emotional resonance, but some metaphors verge on clich√© ("shadows of past mistakes").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise, but phrases like "redemption's path" and "blood-bound oath" lean generic. Elias's voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere well, but the gossip-column device slightly undermines the story's gravitas. Length feels deliberate.</comment>
