<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's outlaw cowboy poet persona is vividly portrayed, with clear motivation and distinct voice. His restless pacing and interaction with the dice reveal depth, though his transition to clarity feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by Ezra's curiosity, with a clear arc. Pacing is tight but effective; the resolution ties back to the beginning, though the word limit slightly rushes the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory is richly immersive, with sensory details (coffee scent, hissing steam) enhancing atmosphere. The setting amplifies the theme of fluid fate, though the coffee shop's role could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dice, shifting walls) and subtext about fate. The ending is satisfying, but some emotional beats are told rather than shown. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clich√©s. The cowboy-poet hybrid and runic dice stand out. Some phrases verge on ornate, but the style is consistent and evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, with creative integration. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering theme of mutable destiny. Minor pacing issues prevent a higher score.</comment>
