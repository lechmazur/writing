<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his actions and reactions revealing depth. His 'voice' is distinct, though some nuances could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc and logical cause-and-effect. Pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the lab's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative but underutilized. The lab's charred state mirrors Elias's psyche well, but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext. The ending is purposeful, and the theme of truth vs. illusion resonates. Some emotional beats could be shown more vividly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and avoids clich√©s. The drone and ticket stubs are fresh metaphors. Minor stiffness in phrasing, but overall style is distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate. Elements serve the story, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering question about truth and identity.</comment>
