<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's compassionate mage persona is well-integrated, but his motivation could be more nuanced. The locket's connection to his lineage is compelling but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc. The submarine hull twist is inventive, though the transition from locket to rivets feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, blending clandestine urgency with ancestral mystery. The "precisely messy" setting is evocative but could use more sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth and symbolism (locket, key). Ending is satisfying, though the "hopeful brutality" tone isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (rivets as code). Minor AI-like phrasing in descriptions, but overall avoids clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce elegantly, and the brevity feels intentional. Leaves a lingering sense of ancestral resonance.</comment>
