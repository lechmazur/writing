<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and consistent, with the spoon and hunger driving his actions. His realization of being the heir adds depth, though his 'voice' could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the mural discovery and mountain ascent forming a coherent arc. Pacing is excellent, though the transition to the mountain feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned movie house and magnetic mountain are vividly rendered, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, mystical atmosphere. The projector's flicker ties beautifully to the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (spoon, murals) and layered themes (hunger, chaos) elevate the story. The ending is satisfying, though the 'frolicsome regret' tone could be more consistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and evocative, with fresh metaphors. Minor AI-like phrasing ("trivially monumental" feels overused). Emotional resonance is strong but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of wonder and destiny.</comment>
