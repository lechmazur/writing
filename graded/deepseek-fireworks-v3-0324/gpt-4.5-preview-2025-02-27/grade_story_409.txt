<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the chisel's strike serving as a powerful catalyst. Pacing is excellent, and the arc feels complete despite the word limit. Cause-and-effect logic is flawless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic and clockwork animals create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, brass, gears) deepen the mood and amplify Elias's isolation and awakening.</comment>
