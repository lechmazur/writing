<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from city planner to doomsday prepper is compelling, and his motivation to escape inauthenticity is clear. The ink blotter effectively symbolizes his internal conflict, though his "rarely authentic" attribute could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and achieves a clear arc, but the handshake-to-constellation transition feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit, though the hidden deal's stakes could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is vividly rendered, with sensory details (bells, torchlight) enhancing mood. The setting meaningfully connects to Elias's quest, though the celestial patterns could feel less abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink blotter, constellations) is potent, and the ending resonates. However, Vikram's role is underdeveloped, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in premise but leans on tropes (wise guide, spiritual awakening). The ink blotter metaphor is fresh, though Elias's doubt occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce well, and the length feels deliberate. The theme of liberation is clear, but the handshake's significance fades too quickly.</comment>
