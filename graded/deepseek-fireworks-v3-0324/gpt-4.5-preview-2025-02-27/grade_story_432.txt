<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's death wish and poison-taster background are compelling, but his shift to mapping energy flows feels slightly abrupt. His motivation is clear but could benefit from deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with a clear arc from Elias's past to his final moment. The pacing is excellent, though the ice sculpture's collapse could be more foreshadowed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and ice sculpture create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (mist, shattering ice) enhance the mood and align perfectly with Elias's serenity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bookmark, ice shards) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending is hauntingly satisfying, though the energy surge feels slightly deus ex machina.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and atmospheric, but the "strangely compelling" refrain borders on repetitive. The death-wish trope is subverted well, but some phrases verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking story where elements serve the narrative. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of mystery and connection.</comment>
