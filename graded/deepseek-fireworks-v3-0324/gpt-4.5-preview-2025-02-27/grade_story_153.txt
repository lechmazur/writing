<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "eternal college student" trait feels slightly underdeveloped. His actions align well with his quest for knowledge, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc from beginning to end. The digitization concept drives the narrative effectively, though the mole people's role could be more integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underground setting and post-stellar timeframe create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like the phosphorescent fungi and headlamp's glow are evocative and immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in literary craft, with strong symbolism (the headlamp's flicker mirroring Elias's realization) and a thought-provoking theme about legacy vs. isolation. The ending is satisfying and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic, avoiding clich√©s. The "mundanely glorious" motif is fresh, though the mole people's indifference could be nuanced further. No AI-generated tropes detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and deliberate, with creative use of assigned elements. Leaves a lingering question about the cost of transcendence, suggesting depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
