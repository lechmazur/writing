<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's pacifism is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her initial avoidance and final, costly engagement. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though the emotional transition from fear to joy feels slightly swift, lacking a moment of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the locket shatters, foreclosing one path to open another. The inferred lens is Causal, holding strongly until a minor ambiguity: the final garden's arrival feels slightly more accumulative than a direct 'therefore' of her action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains tactics. Kwan Yin's Tear is a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception and the story's stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the ship's decay forces Lira's confrontation. The dominant stake (dimensional integrity/survival) is clear, and the cost of her choice (shattering the locket) is legible. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—that true peace requires engagement with darkness—emerges coherently from events and the final image. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the AI's dialogue ("You did not avoid the shadow. You wore it like a cloak") edges toward thematic statement, slightly reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. A minor register drift occurs in the AI's chorus-of-static voice, which feels slightly decorative rather than fully integrated into the ship's established logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision and momentum. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pacifism, shadow work, and generation-ship lore feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The final reconfiguration is earned and feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
