<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion. The motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is clear and intensifies under pressure. However, the "gentle radical" title feels more thematic than a flaw or trait that complicates choices on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the symbolic act of placing the tessera, reconfiguring the plaza's meaning with a felt cost of loss. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and symbolic density. A minor deduction for a slight lens wobble where causal language ("because of them") briefly intrudes on the textural ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the POV's perception. The shattered sky and ancient plaza are not just backdrop; the mosaic tessera, a micro-setting object, actively charges the final image and is central to the closure, constraining the protagonist's choice of action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift and intensifying sensory density that reweights the dominant stake of loss into rebirth. The cost of the fire's destruction is legible throughout, and the protagonist's agency in the final symbolic act is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</theme><comment>The theme of finding mercy and meaning in ruin emerges powerfully from the specific imagery and action, resisting direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction is applied for the phrase "aberrant mercy," which edges toward thematic echo and prompt-language in its first mention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled, and poetic perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's consciousness. Purposeful compression and elision are used effectively, and the voice is a significant strength of the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally high with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction is applied for a slight pattern of repetitive sentence stems ("He reached," "He saw," "He stood") in the middle beats, creating a mild template cadence that slightly dulls momentum before the strong closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, retrocognitive ability, and a philosophical focus on mercy feels fresh and organic. The specific, grounded choices in voice and imagery create a singular and memorable perspective that transcends any familiar elements. The risk-taking in the quiet, symbolic climax pays off.</comment>
