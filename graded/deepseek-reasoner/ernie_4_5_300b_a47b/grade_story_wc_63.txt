<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lirael's ethically diligent trait is embodied through methodical investigation, not told. Her final choice to use the rake handle arises from prior causality (grandfather's wisdom, inscription discovery) with visible cost as the ridge's pain sears her vision. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the pendulum restarts through incremental correction, reweighting the world's balance with felt cost (raw hands, ridge's relief). The accumulative/textural lens holds, though the rake's late introduction creates a minor causality hitch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but actor—it shudders, cracks, and hums, constraining Lirael's choices and charging the final image as cracks seal "smooth as glass." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the lengthening Hush, tightening Lirael's options under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible as the air thickens "like syrup" and she feels the ridge's pain. Her agency (whispering the inscription, aligning the rake) earns the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from the inscription, her grandfather's wisdom, and the final act—avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the pendulum's slow, deliberate arc and the relieved tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature attuned to geological time and mechanical precision. The inscription's uneven letters and grandfather's dialogue carry subtext. Minor register elevation ("searing reverie") briefly clashes with her pragmatic voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. Figurative language ("like a blackened spine") serves atmosphere without muddle. One minor paraphrase loop ("steady as she wound" / "gears' thirst for motion") but clarity remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of cosmic mediation and horological precision, transformed through specific lived detail (obsidian shards, rune-etched bob). The broken rake handle is a particularly ingenious inflection—ordinary yet charged, irreplaceable in the story's logic.</comment>
