<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("chest tightened") and a credible micro-choice to confront the fracture. However, the final resolve feels slightly declared rather than fully dramatized by the preceding struggle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: memory is reweighted from a potential cage to a necessary compass. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and conceptual density toward a final image of "new resonance" with clear cost ("doubt transformed into resolve").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge and the dream-cavern function as a micro-setting that actively pressures Lira's choices. The seed is a recurring object that constrains action and charges the final image through its dissolution. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening in the dream sequence. Lira's agency drives the escalation ("Show me the fracture"). The cost of choosing courage over fear is legible, though the felt price of the choice is slightly conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a compass emerges coherently from the dream visions and Lira's choice, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for the dream-woman's dialogue, which edges toward thematic echo ("memory is not a cage but a compass").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's perception, with a distinct lyrical and precise texture. The voice modulates effectively under pressure, and the patterned elision of the dream sequence is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, but occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors ("dissonance in the wind, a silence where laughter should echo") create minor artifacts. The rhythm is strong and supports the accumulative drive, though a few phrases slightly blur sense under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "reality checker" on a mythic island with a knowledge fruit seed is fresh and organic. The core concept of collective memory is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the dream logic and the final reconfiguration. The risk-taking with the dream sequence heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
