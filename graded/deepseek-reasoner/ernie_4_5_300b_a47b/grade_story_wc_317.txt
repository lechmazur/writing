<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a coherent, motivated character whose curiosity and receptivity drive the narrative. His decision to plant the seed is a strong micro-choice revealing his values. However, the internal contradiction and embodied struggle under pressure are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias’s realization reconfigures his understanding of mystery. The inferred Causal lens holds: his investigative actions (examining, calling, following) lead logically to the key's discovery. The cost is legible in his laughter and the final image of the cold key, signaling a conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the brook murmurs and the nocturnal haven charges the final image. The environment constrains choice—the seed leads to the brook, where the key is found. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional and personal priorities (e.g., "storm-born silence").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Elias's examination, planting, and pursuit of the slime trail each tighten the mystery. The dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) is tested by the seed's arrival. A minor deduction as the plant's accelerated growth and disappearance feel slightly convenient, though they ultimately serve the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of allowing answers to emerge naturally is earned through the specific event of the seed's growth and the final key discovery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept (mystery seed) integrates fully with this thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, slightly analytical texture fitting an escape room designer. The prose reflects his mind ("flow through orthogonal approaches"). No dialogue is present. A minor, almost negligible, register drift occurs in the phrase "storm-born silence," which feels slightly elevated for his lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. However, a template cadence appears in the sequence of investigative steps ("First, he examined... Next, he analyzed..."), which slightly dulls momentum. This is a minor artifact that does not touch the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of an escape room proprietor and a corpse flower seed is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The final reconfiguration feels earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
