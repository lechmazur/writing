<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling their journey. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. However, the final transformation into "becoming silence" is slightly abstract, leaning on thematic resonance rather than a dramatized, embodied cost, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot coheres through a pattern of sensory and symbolic progression. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear, felt cost: the keeper's loosened grip on reality. The origami swan's folds provide a taught, legible structure that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and charging the final image. The library is not a backdrop but a character itself, its "crumbling peace" and physical decay constraining the keeper's path. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each fold of the swan presenting a new, tangible obstacle. The dominant stake (attaining regenerative silence) is clear, and the cost of the journey is legible in the keeper's wavering reflection and final transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of judgment versus pure witness emerges organically from the keeper's specific struggle. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the library's burden from a "chain" to a "bridge" without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, decaying quality that mirrors the setting. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, though a slight tendency toward dense figurative language in peak beats ("becoming silence, becoming change") creates minor opacity, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "becoming nothing and everything all at once") which slightly muddles clarity. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and information density are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sentient library, an origami map, and a quest for ontological silence is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high conceptual integrity, avoiding cliché and generic templates.</comment>
