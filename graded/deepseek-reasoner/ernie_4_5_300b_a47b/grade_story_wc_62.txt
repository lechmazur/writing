<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow's interiority is concrete and embodied ("chisel-calloused hands"), and his final choice to write and read his poem is earned by prior causality. His motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" is dramatized through his nightly returns and interactions with the voice, compelling higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the final image of the faded ribbon and the promise of light reconfigures Marlow's understanding of grief. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered stories and the butterfly migration's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("damp earth and forgotten roses," "glass panes rattled"), filtered through Marlow's perception and integrated into action, making the setting a living, breathing character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the nightly returns and the migration's progression deepening the stakes. The cost is legible in Marlow's final, steady voice and the decision to carve from love, not loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a bridge emerges organically from events and images (the ribbon, the poems, the butterflies). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final poem, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. A slight register drift occurs in the climax ("fiercely meditative" feels slightly external), but the perceptual signature remains strong and the voice is otherwise coherent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. No loops or scaffold. A single minor artifact: the phrase "fiercely meditative" in a high-pressure beat introduces a slight diagnostic label, but it does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver, a spectral greenhouse, and a butterfly migration is fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, resulting in a singular and memorable perspective.</comment>
