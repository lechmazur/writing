<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the dream dissolves into her soul. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on-page: "etched into her bones, as real as the salt on her skin." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence shift. Orientation is anchored early; the persistent constraint of longing shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The archipelago and lighthouse function as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The palette and light are tactile objects that evolve with events, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with a cadence shift at the climax that reweights the stake. Cost is legible when the dream dissolves. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, though the pressure coheres without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to longing. Subtext operates through implication ("cipher of longing"). No moralizing; the conceptual repricing at closure is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity while maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure. Minor overwriting in phrases like "bruise of twilight" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (lighthouse, dreams) through specific voice and setting. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed by grounded choices.</comment>
