<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific worldview. Her micro-choices (arranging the objects) are compelling and reveal her values. The final earned stasis (understanding) is a credible endurance scaled to the length. The only minor flaw is a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("inadvertently profound").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear, felt cost of potential and altered perception. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through pattern and cadence shift. The final image of the listening houses reconfigures the story's meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely described but is the crucible of the action. The bay's quiet amplifies the experiment's effect, and the recurring object (orris root) decisively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lira's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake (understanding) is signaled early and tightens through her deliberate arrangement of objects. The cost is legible on the page in the palpable shift of the atmosphere and the reweighted reality of the houses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence as potential emerges organically from the particulars of the objects and Lira's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept ("a shard of hush") is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and stakes, resisting abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("the way a window frame leaned half an inch too far"). The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively with the scene's rising pressure. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "inadvertently profound" feels slightly label-like and is repeated, creating a tiny loop that slightly dulls the peak beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "creeping normality noticer" with a mystical theory of displaced objects is fresh and specific. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its premise. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
