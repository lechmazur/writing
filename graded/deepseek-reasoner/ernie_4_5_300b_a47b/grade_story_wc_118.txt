<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions like tracing walls and probing ashes. His sensitively perceptive trait drives micro-choices that escalate stakes, and his final recognition of the axis shift feels earned by prior causality with visible cost when the tapestry's dragons unfurl.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) through recognition, shifting the axis of attention with cost felt in the vibrating silo and rising voices. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (tapestry's hidden letters) deepening stakes. The exact moment of axis shift could be sharper, but cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices—the silo's curved walls and fireplace debris shape Elias's investigation. The tapestry charges the final image as dragons unfurl, and sensory details like "bronze quiet" and "scent of old paper" are purposefully woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with probing diaries and deciphering tapestry letters tightening stakes. Cost is legible in the silo's hum and rising voices, though the pressure coheres through density rather than causal turns. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Clara's writings and the tapestry's reconfiguration—stories waiting to be heard, belief shaping perception. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the "displaced axis" as a shift in attention rather than reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("steel ribs rusting into the earth like bones of a forgotten god"). Diction remains within Elias's lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak beats ("low hum filled the silo"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and strong metaphors. Minor overwriting in phrases like "sensitively perceptive gaze" leans slightly toward label-speak, but clarity and momentum are maintained. No loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silo library, medieval tapestry, and metaphysical axis concept feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design pays off with closure. Specificity in details like "brass poker" and "railroad spikes" avoids generic templates.</comment>
