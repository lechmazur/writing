<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete and rooted in loss, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure mounts. Her interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in her tactile interaction with the censer foot. The final choice to build the antenna feels earned by her prior causality and the grandmother's calls. A slight deduction for "raw solace" feeling slightly diagnostic in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with felt cost as the lost routes are called back. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through repeated midnight calls and the censer foot's evolving use. The persistent constraint of the failed hydraulics and the moon's phase shape tactics. The cryptic calls are a patterned element that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and the patina bronze censer foot are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The station's decay and the censer foot's fluctuating weight are integral to the plot. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara's professional priorities, creating a cohesive, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with each cryptic call deepening the stakes and narrowing Mara's options to a single, costly action. The cost is legible on the page in her raw effort and the station's shaking walls. The dominant stake of navigating loss is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of navigating loss through memory emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the censer foot, the failed hydraulics, and the ghostly calls. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the chorus of voices, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the grandmother's fragmented voice and the spinning foot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends technical observation with poetic longing. The voice remains consistent under pressure, though the single line "raw solace" creates a minor register drift in a high-stakes beat. The cryptic dialogue from the phone is effectively unnatural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly evocative and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "raw solace" feels slightly out of register with the POV's lexicon in that moment, creating a small figurative muddle in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentences are clean, concise, and advance multiple story elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a patchwork navigator, a mystical bronze foot, and reverse migration through radio signals is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the supernatural phone calls heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
