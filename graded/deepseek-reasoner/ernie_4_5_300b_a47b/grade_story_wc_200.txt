<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to engage the spirit. Her fear that "laughter is not enough" is a concrete, character-particular doubt that complicates her goal. The final choice to offer the tooth is a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. The trait "modestly fearless" is shown through action but could be more embodied under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lira's understanding of her tool and purpose is reconfigured, landing with the cost of a relinquished former belief. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from dissonant music to silent warmth. The final image of the "luminous ache of hope" makes the cost and reconfiguration legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally integrated, with Echo Gorge's humming pebbles and stone ribs actively constraining Lira's path and choices. The crocodile's tooth, a micro-setting object, charges the final image and is central to the closure beat. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Lira's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification from the keening note to the confrontation, forcing Lira's stance crystallization. The dominant stake (integrating laughter) is tested and reweighted. The cost is legible in the final beat's "luminous ache," a felt price for her newfound understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of healing as a pursuit emerges organically from the core concept and Lira's struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and realization, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The integration of laughter and truth feels earned and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The dialogue with the spirit is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("sky bled gold," "stone ribs") is purposeful and coherent. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("modestly fearless" as a label), but it does not harm clarity or closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a lost soul collector is fresh and executed with specificity. The combination of spectral confessions and integrating laughter offers a non-obvious angle on healing. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative design. It feels organic, not derivative of common templates.</comment>
