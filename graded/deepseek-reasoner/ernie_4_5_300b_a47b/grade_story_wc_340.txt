<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's warmly inquisitive nature is embodied through specific actions (tracing symbols, trying on goggles) and her final choice to engage the widow is a micro-decision that reveals her hierarchy of values. Her emotional state is concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of her servant role feels earned by her prior curiosity, though the transition from discovery to confrontation is slightly swift, costing a hairline deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara reconfigures the widow's grief and her own role, with cost legible in the widow's "hands shook" and "laugh, a sound like wind through frozen pines." The diary's discovery and the goggles' function are causal linkages that tighten options. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire and the captain's study are not merely descriptive; they pressure choice and charge the final image. The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining Mara's perception to reveal hidden patterns. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional and personal priorities (e.g., "dust that sparkled like starlight"). The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Mara's choice to read the diary and use the goggles actively narrows her options and changes her knowledge, leading to the final confrontation. The dominant stake (unraveling the captain's truth) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is felt in the widow's cracked detachment and Mara's shifted role, though the pressure could have been slightly more relentless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of joy/anguish as inseparable twins emerges through concrete events and images (the diary phrase, the phoenix symbol, the final hand-to-chest gesture) rather than direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The core concept integrates fully with theme through specific particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's noticing ("gears grinding like a tired heart"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, especially in the final exchange. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture. A minor register consistency question in the phrase "affectionate in her detachment" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A slight tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sparkled like starlight") and a single potential filter verb ("her mind raced") in a high-pressure beat prevents a top score, but no loops or scaffolds obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of icebound spire, airship captain's mystery, and encrypted diary feels organic and fresh, not a checklist. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on grief and discovery. The final reconfiguration feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity without quirkiness.</comment>
