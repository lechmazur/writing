<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, empathetic professionalism. Her "persistently curious" trait drives micro-choices, like using the dead hearing aid, which reveals character under pressure. The final choice to assure the woman is earned, with a visible emotional cost shown in her tightened throat. A minor deduction for a slight over-articulation of her role's purpose in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds strongly. The inciting incident (finding the photo) leads directly to investigation and a climax where her agency (placing the hearing aids together) creates the decisive change. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the shared silence holds "unspoken gratitude," with cost legible in the woman's single tear. Orientation is immediate and clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a vital, pressure-exerting environment, not a backdrop. It guides choice through its labyrinthine west wing and supplies key resources (the fountain, the cobwebbed hearing aid). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lila's professional POV. The setting constrains tactics and decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the Causal lens: each choice narrows options. The dominant stake (assuring a vulnerable voice) is signaled early and tightens as the pulse leads her deeper. The cost is felt in the emotional weight of the message and the physical relief of the synchronized pulses. A single, meaningful tightening is executed perfectly for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of listening to the faintest pulses of love and truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"Sometimes love is too big for words"—that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the final exchange's gestures and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("mist curling around her ankles like spectral cats"). The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposefully modulated, heightening under pressure. Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and effective, though a single minor mixed metaphor ("a heartbeat trapped in amber" slightly clashes with the vibrational nature of sound) prevents a higher score. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of the paranormal and the deeply human. It is fully committed to and transformed by specific, grounded choices in character, world, and tactile detail (the algae-softened photo, the cobwebbed hearing aid). The combination feels inevitable and highly original.</comment>
