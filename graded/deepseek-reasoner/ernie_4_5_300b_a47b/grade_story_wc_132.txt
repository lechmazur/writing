<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eleanor's internal conflict between control and surrender is embodied and specific, culminating in a credible, earned renunciation. Her micro-choice to withdraw her hand is a pivotal, character-defining moment. Mara applies effective secondary pressure, though her function is slightly more instrumental than fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Eleanor internalizes the plant's wisdom. The cost of her prior rigidity is felt in the withered hellebore, and the final image of the autonomous vines reweights the premise. Linkage is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and steamy greenhouse are not just described but function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through Eleanor's professional POV, with the linden leaf and climbing vines acting as recurring objects that evolve in meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift—the hellebore's retraction—that reweights the dominant stake of control vs. surrender. The cost of Eleanor's relinquishment is the death of the original plant, a visible price that alters her tactics and charges the final, open-ended image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "sustaining transformation" emerges organically from the hellebore's metamorphosis and Eleanor's parallel internal shift, avoiding moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the autonomous vines, reweighting prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a botanical lexicon and perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled, though the phrase "circuitously sincere" risks feeling slightly manufactured on its second use, creating a minor, non-fatal artifact in an otherwise distinct voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and highly efficient, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for the slightly forced recurrence of "circuitously sincere," which creates a small text artifact. Otherwise, sentences advance multiple jobs without scaffold or loop, and clarity remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of reluctant metamorphosis is synthesized with originality through the specific lens of botanical study. The perspective feels fresh and fully committed, transforming a familiar arc into a singular, inevitable-feeling story grounded in concrete, verifiable detail.</comment>
