<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's legacy, compelling her higher-stakes choice to "bewitch" the mural. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("throat tightened," "pulse quickened"). The final endurance of curiosity is earned by prior causality, though the climax moment of revelation feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: Marisol's experiments lead directly to the mural's awakening because of the nickel's properties. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she accepts ongoing curiosity, with cost felt in the final image of the garden as a "state of mind." Orientation is immediate; the inciting incident (using the nickel) is clear and consequential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and supplying the resonant E-flat frequency crucial to the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("low, droning E-flat," "cracks began to shimmer"). The garden and nickel constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the mural's secret) is signaled early and escalates through Marisol's agency—her decision to use the nickel triggers the decisive tightening. Cost is legible in her physical reaction and the final acceptance of perpetual curiosity. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length, though the climax beat could be more physically immersive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (curiosity vs. certainty) emerges organically from events and the final image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reweighted image of the garden as a "rhythm" of awakening. Subtext operates in implication, such as the flapper figure mirroring Marisol's own journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature ("in the hush between noon and dusk"). Prose rhythm is controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., the flapper's brief appearance) serves closure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though sparse. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor artifact: "methodically playful" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing sound physics, art restoration, and memory into a fresh, organic whole. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with specificity. The hobo nickel and sound-wave mechanics are irreplaceable details that avoid tropiness. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual climax pays off.</comment>
