<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with strong interiority and embodied emotion. Her final choice to grip the light is earned by prior causality, though Vey's flat tone slightly undermines the cost's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (gripping the thread) with visible cost (seared skin), though Vey's unsurprised tone slightly mutes the final emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vividly atmospheric and actively pressures choices through its distorting mirrors and shifting shadows. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image with the scent of ozone and cracked glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening (confronting the shadow) and clear cost (seared hand). The dominant stake (breaking the curse) is tested and resolved with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of fear/truth emerges through events and images without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Vey's final line, though it leans slightly toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and controlled diction. Dialogue serves action and subtext effectively. The voice maintains consistency under pressure with purposeful syntax and rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory detail. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("pulsed like a diseased star") causes slight register drift, but clarity and momentum remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of curse-breaking and psychological horror. The combination of elements feels organic, with specific grounded choices in character and setting that avoid template plotting.</comment>
