<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her professional identity and a "cautiously hopeful" disposition that drives her risky choice. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied emotion ("hands trembled") and a micro-choice to act despite uncertainty. However, the trait "cautiously hopeful" is more told than shown through a visible trade-off in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lila accepts the ongoing game, with cost felt in the final image of the mocking chart and haunting voice. Causality is tight: her subsonic intervention directly causes the truce and the tricksters' return. The final beat reconfigures the stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The university radio station is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Lila's choice, from the humming transmitter to the basement's vintage equipment. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through her professional POV. The oscilloscopes and charts are key objects that charge the final image when the singed chart is taped to the wall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the Causal lens: her decision to interfere with subsonic frequencies is a major tightening that narrows options and triggers the truce. The cost is legible in the community's softened division and the personal cost of the tricksters' returned challenge. The stake (preventing chaos) is tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (power, gamesmanship, communication) emerges organically from the core concept and Lila's actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the chessboard and the shifted, smoky note. It embraces complexity without moralizing, though the thematic echo of "power is a river" in the final voiceover slightly diminishes the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends technical precision ("subsonic frequencies") with poetic observation ("wind chimes made of starlight"). The voice remains consistent under pressure, and purposeful elision (the exact mechanics of the code) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though sparse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs. A minor figurative muddle occurs with the voice "like shattering glass" following the starlight chimes, creating a slight register clash in a peak beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—a celestial signal interpreter battling cosmic tricksters via radio waves—is a fresh, specific synthesis of cosmic horror and technical realism. The combination feels organic and inevitable, executed with high conceptual integrity. The risk-taking in blending these elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
