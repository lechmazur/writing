<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's insomnia and poetic drive are embodied and specific, not diagnostic. Her final shift from weaponized writing to offering is earned by the postcard's catalyst and the tree's growth, with the cost of her old self legible in her newfound sleep. Contradictory impulses of creation and exhaustion act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The postcard's arrival seeds a pattern of release (leaving poems) that culminates in the tree's growth and her song, reconfiguring her relationship to her art with a felt cost—the loss of her defining insomnia. Linkage is via pattern density, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell and its bioluminescent moss are not just decorative; they constrain her existence and later bloom, charging the final image. The setting is a character-specific filter ("reef-shadow joy") and evolves causally with the migration and the tree's growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is accumulative: the postcard's arrival deepens her artistic stance, leading to the act of releasing poems, which intensifies the stake of connection until the tree's growth reweights her options. The cost is the surrender of her insomnia, a core part of her identity, made legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming pain into beauty is earned through the specific, concrete particulars of Lira's centuries-long struggle and the catalyst of the postcard. The final image of the singing tree offers a resonant, non-literal answer—beauty as an offering, not a shield—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, luminescent texture that remains consistent under pressure. Perception is tightly filtered through Lira's poetic sensibility ("photosynthesize pain," "reef-shadow joy"). Purposeful elision (the sender's identity) is taught and paid off in the story's focus on internal transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("half-sung lullabies" / "off-key wind") exists but does not obscure closure or cause momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a poet in a migratory shell is a fresh, organic synthesis. The specific, non-obvious angle on artistic creation—turning exhaustion into art and then art into connection—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
