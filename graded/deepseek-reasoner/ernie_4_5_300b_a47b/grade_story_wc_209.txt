<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her grandmother's legacy, compelling her to higher-stakes choices like trespassing in the cathedral. Her internal conflict between her commissioned work and her true obsession is shown simultaneously. The final choice to paint the shadows is earned by her prior discoveries. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on told backstory in the second paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Causal, with clear because/therefore linkages: Mara's obsession leads her to Sister Agatha, whose clue sends her to the window, whose inscription directs her final artistic choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her understanding shifts from defiance to communion, with cost legible in her continued, deeper reckoning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot. The cathedral window is the micro-setting that constrains and enables Mara's choices, directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's artistic and personal priorities (e.g., "the glass hummed, a low, resonant vibration").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (understanding her grandmother's quest) tightens as Mara's investigation progresses from research to trespass to deciphering the inscription. The cost is the time and obsessive focus she diverts from her commission, altering her artistic tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the convergence of Mara's art, her grandmother's botany, and Thorn's window. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("communion" not "defiance") that reweights the central question. The final image of the "unbroken" promise avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized with a distinct perceptual signature ("fiery confetti," "bioluminescent hues"). The prose is consistently lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible ("as if the walls themselves breathed"). No scaffolding, loops, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mural art, nocturnal botany, and cryptographic stained glass is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept ("reckon through the hidden layers") is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. The story commits fully to its lyrical, contemplative premise.</comment>
