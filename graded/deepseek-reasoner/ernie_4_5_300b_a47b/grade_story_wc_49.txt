<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to enlist the community is earned by prior causality. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, though minor diagnostic label-speak ("ever the dreamer") slightly limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (the spent tendril, her aching hands). Orientation is immediate; the pattern of magic accumulation through song and image coheres and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The verdant arbor and the vine tendril function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven into action, with the environment evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens; the stakes (restoring magic) are clear and tighten through the song's progression. The cost is legible in the spent tendril and her physical exhaustion, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about community and continual tending. Avoids moralizing; the final image of the sapling reinforces the theme without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature. Diction remains within Lira's lexicon, though minor register drift ("liquid gold") occurs early. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Minor overwriting in early figurative language ("sunlight slanted through leaves like liquid gold") and a slight template cadence in the opening paragraph prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The combination of whimsical tinkering and forest magic feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
