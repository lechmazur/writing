<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to understand rather than survive. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through actions like tracing sun patterns. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her past self’s labor made visible. The zen potter trait is slightly underutilized in shaping tactics, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with undeniable cost: Mara’s realization that the oasis "chooses which timeline to nurture" reweights the premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterned echoes (sunflowers, lantern) to a cadence shift. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight, with the vision arising from established elements (phototropism, sun patterns).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring choice and charging the final image. The oasis constrains tactics (well, sunflowers) and the wasteland backdrop reinforces stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("air tasted of ash," "skeletal hives"). The sunflowers and lantern glass function as micro-settings that evolve meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: Mara’s methodical investigation deepens into a vision that reweights the dominant stake (understanding). Cost is legible in the revelation of her past self’s labor. Pressure coheres through pattern breaks (sunflowers’ anomaly) and intensifies to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—kindness bending reality through phototropism—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to shape time, one must first tend to the light." Subtext operates in implication (sunflowers as prayer). Complexity is embraced through multiple timelines without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("mind like still water"). Diction and rhythm are controlled, even under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., vision sequences) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional: high information density, zero loops or scaffold, and vivid figurative language that enhances clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("horizon bled orange"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the vision. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high: a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements, grounded in specific detail (phototropism to kindness). Tropes are transformed through character and world choices. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on entropy and memory. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
