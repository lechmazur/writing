<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied in micro-choices like dismantling the console. His mantra ("Discard assumptions") guides his actions credibly, and his final laugh and awe feel earned. However, interiority relies slightly on professional abstraction ("celestial signal interpreter") rather than deeper personal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the hush transforms from malfunction to potential, rebirthing the city. The accumulative lens holds, building through density of imagery and a cadence shift into revelation. Cost is legible in Kael's seared palm and the discarded, inert fragment. The lunar perigee is a minor untracked element but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the fissure, the console) and charging the final image (the river of light). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional bias. The gorge and tower are tactile and evolve causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens: his decision to dismantle the console deepens the stakes and unlocks the hush. The cost is visible in the searing heat and the discarded technology. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: endings as doorways, silence as potential. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The Hollywood fragment's reweighting from fame to mirror is a superb particular that deepens the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive signature ("skeletal hand," "spectral fingers"). Some phrases verge on decorative ("serenely electric static"), creating minor register drift. However, the lyrical pattern is taught and paid off at closure, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but suffers minor artifacting: "serenely electric" is repeated, and some metaphors are slightly mixed ("shadows stretched like spectral fingers" followed by "humming with... static"). This does not obscure closure, but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio waves, silence, and rebirth is fresh and specific. The core concept of the "shard of hush" is ingeniously transformed from a malfunction into a language. The risk-taking with lyrical density pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
