<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in "functional creativity" that drives her choices. Her internal state is concrete and embodied, though a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing ("maze of intentions") in her reflection prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds accumulatively to a resonant Conceptual Repricing closure with a visible cost (the terminal's dimming lights, the equation etched in memory). The lens is primarily accumulative, though the final beat's causality (the hum resonating with the sextant) leans slightly hybrid, causing minor ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, a character in itself that pressures choices and charges the final image. The abandoned terminal is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through Lila's professional POV, and the sextant piece constrains her action and becomes the catalyst for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (finding the sextant, redirecting flows) and escalate through Lila's agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the terminal's shudder and the projected equation's raw, untested state. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific action of repurposing decay into hope. The final equation is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding moralizing. The integration of concept ("functional resurrection") with character motive is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, engineering-focused lens. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. Some minor register drift occurs near the climax ("stoic wonder," "functional resurrection"), but it remains largely voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. One notable flaw: the metaphor "a sound like wind through a forgotten city" contradicts the established enclosed, domed setting of the terminal, creating a coherence break (-0.3). Otherwise, line-level craft is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar SF tropes (abandoned port, relic hunt) into a fresh, specific, and emotionally honest narrative about repurposing decay. The core concept of "functional creativity" is original and indispensable to the plot and theme, driving the unique closure.</comment>
