<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's ambition and patience are consistently embodied through micro-choices like adjusting soil acidity and humming lullabies. Her internal conflict between forcing growth and embracing stillness feels earned, culminating in a credible renunciation of haste that charges the closure. The olfactorily sensitive trait is fully integrated into her actions rather than labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through sensory density and Lira's evolving journal entries. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the village's energy harmonizes through the flower's bloom, with cost legible in the elders' humbled admission. The dream sequence provides a meaningful turning point that deepens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated into choice and closure—the treetop village's mist and lanterns constrain perception, while the corpse flower's cultivation becomes a tactile process. The seed's scent evolution mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Environment charges the final image where petals glow in twilight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the seed's dormancy and dream revelation forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visible in her jagged doodles and the elders' initial skepticism. One meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from forcing growth to embracing stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the corpse flower's cultivation—wisdom growing in "hush not roar" is earned through Lira's struggle. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: chaos and serenity as kin. No moralizing; the conceptual repricing occurs through the flower's transformative scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—olfactory focus and selective attention to botanical details. Diction remains within Lira's herbalist lexicon, even under pressure. The journalizing action is consistently rendered through concrete descriptions rather than summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without losing clarity, though minor scaffold appears in phrases like "olfactorily sensitive nose." Figurative language ("vines draped like ancient tapestries") serves atmosphere without muddling peaks. Rhythm modulates effectively between journal entries and narrative action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical precision and mystical village life. The corpse flower trope is transformed through specific cultivation details and thematic depth. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off with closure. No derivative echoes; voice feels singular and committed.</comment>
