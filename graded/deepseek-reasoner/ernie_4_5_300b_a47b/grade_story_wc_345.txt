<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, compelling her to higher-stakes action. Her internal conflict is shown through her worry about message clarity, a credible micro-choice. The final renunciation (fading away) is earned by her prior causality, though the cost of her departure is felt more conceptually than viscerally on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara fades, her mission complete, with the cost felt in her absence. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through the accumulation of chalk messages. The final image of the chiming bell recharges prior motifs. One persistent constraint—her intangibility—shapes her tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly established and pressure the central conflict by crumbling. The butterfly bell is a key micro-setting object that constrains Elara's actions (guiding droplets) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a calming, protective POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from individual doubt to collective determination, driven by the protagonist's agency (the messages). The dominant stake (saving the arches/orchards/nebula) is signaled early. The cost is the settlers' labor and Elara's eventual departure, legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of collective hope emerges organically from events and images (messages, bell, nebula). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the tended garden and chiming bell, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, such as the settlers' shifting conversations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct, ethereal perceptual signature. The prose has controlled rhythm and poetic texture, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (how a ghost writes chalk messages) is taught and does not harm closure clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and concise with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. Minor figurative strain in "brambled hope" slightly muddles tone at a peak moment, but does not obscure closure. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes ghost story and eco-fable into a fresh, specific vision. The orchard planet and altruistic ghost are transformed through grounded, particular choices in character and world. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
