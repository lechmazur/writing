<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("taste of iron," "tremor in her hands"). Her final understanding is earned by the journey and confrontation, though the dialogue's slightly elevated register creates a minor disconnect from her established interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in her understanding. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density. A minor deduction for the dialogue's shift into a more declarative mode, which slightly softens the otherwise impeccable pattern-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional integration. The cobalt grotto, ridge path, and ember grotto itself are not just described but actively constrain and charge every choice, most notably the final image of her glistening hands. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates superbly through the climb's physical difficulty and the grotto's overwhelming sensory intensity, culminating in the confrontation. The cost of her realization is legible and reweights her entire stance, fulfilling the requirements for high-band scoring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "bleeding starlight" and the queen's journey, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about fear and rule. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though the dialogue's explicit articulation of theme slightly diminishes the pure implicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained throughout. The single POV is stable and deeply filtered through the queen's consciousness. The dialogue with the figure is the sole minor flaw, its slightly formal register creating a perceptible shift from the narrator's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("cobalt grotto... stretching like a bruise") is consistent, purposeful, and legible. No loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats. A near-flawless execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a disenchanted monarch and a mystical, bleeding landscape feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformative, and the story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative premise. The specific, grounded choices in character and world elevate it beyond a simple trope.</comment>
