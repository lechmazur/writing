<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss and professional exile, with embodied emotion ("throat tightened") and a micro-choice to accept the prism that alters her detached stance. Her final choice to embrace others' burdens feels earned by prior causality, though the brother's backstory remains slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with density increasing through layered imagery (stars, temple, prism) culminating in Lirael's resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as she accepts shared burdens, etching her brother's lullaby into her skin—a decisive change that reweights prior material. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory and temple are vividly rendered through sensory detail ("frosted glass," "gears whirring") and constrain choices—the prism refracts light critical to the climax. The setting evolves from isolation to connection, charging the final image with dawn's light over the crater.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal decoding to empathetic burden-sharing, driven by Lirael's agency in stepping into the hologram. Cost is legible when she lets voices "wash over her," foregoing chronicler detachment. One meaningful tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the temple's mechanics and Lirael's arc, resisting moralizing. The final image of the etched lullaby offers a non-literal answer to isolation vs. connection, reweighting the brother's loss through collective grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic ("silver moth trapped in amber"), with consistent POV and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Veyra's frayed voice contrasts Lirael's interiority. Elision (brother's disappearance) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong metaphorical cohesion. Minor overwriting in peaks ("a tide finding its shore") slightly softens clarity, but propulsion and rhythm remain compelling. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial mapping, dream chronicling, and empathetic linguistics feels fresh and inevitable. The temple's shifting inscriptions and star-mirror concept are ingeniously integrated, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
