<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's characterization is deeply integrated with his philosophical worldview, shown through concrete actions like net-mending and pattern-deciphering. His internal contradiction (celebration vs. meditation on absence) acts simultaneously in scene. The final realization is earned by prior causality, with the cost of shifted perception visible in the closing image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as Kael's perception of the world's hidden labor is decisively reweighted. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's startled laugh and trembling whisk. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The parapet, rain, mist, and fireflies actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective (e.g., "foam glowing faintly in the moonlight") and filtered through Kael's professional and philosophical priorities. The setting evolves from backdrop to active participant in the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (appreciating hidden effort) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens: his decision to follow the whistle and actively decipher the fireflies' code constitutes a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is the irreversible shift in his perception of the world's design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of hidden labor emerges entirely through events and images (mended nets, vibrating whisk, coded fireflies), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The final image of the trembling whisk perfectly encapsulates the theme's emotional and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("a meditation on absence"). The prose's lyrical, measured rhythm modulates effectively under the pressure of discovery. Purposeful elision (the source of the whistle) creates productive mystery that pays off in the conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery ("harbor lights flickered like drowsy fireflies"). Minor deduction for a single potential coherence strain in "the demure audacity of it all," which slightly risks abstraction in a peak beat, though it is quickly grounded by the subsequent concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a net-mender philosopher deciphering a natural code via a grandfather's relic feels fresh and organic. The core concept is executed with high specificity and authenticity, avoiding trope or template. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off with a potent and original conceptual repricing.</comment>
