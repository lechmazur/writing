<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as leader, intensifying under pressure. Her final declaration is earned by prior observation and embodies a micro-choice with visible cost. The widow scene crystallizes her intergenerational goal with concrete trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of anonymous donations builds to Mira's declarative act, a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost (donations cease, replaced by vulnerable notes) and reconfigures community identity. The final image of the bell singing with voices confirms the reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and bell are vivid, purposeful anchors. The bell constrains choice (Mira's method) and charges the final image. Sensory details (wet clay, amplified quiet) reflect urgency and tone. Lacks a choice-constraining environmental pressure to reach 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (survival vs. solidarity) escalate through Mira's agency under the accumulative lens. Her declaration forces a trade-off (loss of anonymous safety for vulnerable connection) with cost legible on-page. Pressure tightens via the solstice gathering and its aftermath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational solidarity emerges through concrete particulars (bread, fishing, needlework). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the bell's transformed meaning. Subtext operates in gestures (widow's hand squeeze) and the community's mosaic of notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("amplified quiet"). Diction remains within Mira's lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but functional (council debate, widow's whisper). Minor register drift ("amplified quiet" repeats) prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and concise, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. Minor artifacts: "amplified quiet" repeats, and "sanctioned moon" feels slightly elevated. No loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of community resilience tropes through specific details (terra-cotta arbor, silver bell). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Lacks a truly non-obvious turn or structural risk to reach higher bands, but execution is organic and coherent.</comment>
