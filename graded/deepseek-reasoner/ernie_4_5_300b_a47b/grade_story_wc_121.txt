<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her core contradiction: the desire for connection versus the safety of distance. Her final choice to embrace all versions of herself is earned by the on-page journey through the timelines, with the cost of her power's loss felt in the final descent. The interiority is concrete and avoids diagnostic labels, though the emotional weight of witnessing the timelines could be more embodied in the peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara renounces her power to walk grounded, with the cost of that loss made legible on the page. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through the density of witnessed possibilities. The final image of the "darkening brightness" reconfigures the initial premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct and the clay tablet are masterfully integrated, with the viaduct's light acting as a constant atmospheric pressure and the tablet physically constraining choice as it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's urgency. The setting evolves from a physical space to a temporal one seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through the increasing density and emotional weight of the witnessed timelines, which deepens the central stake of self-acceptance. This culminates in a final, decisive renunciation. The cost—the loss of her defining power—is clear and felt, though the middle timelines could apply more direct pressure on her immediate choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of self-acceptance emerges organically from the core concept and Mara's journey, resisting a tidy moral in favor of a complex, earned resonance. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the "darkening brightness" of the viaduct from a mysterious setting into a symbol of hard-won peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the story's emotional intensity. The voice is consistent, and the controlled use of figurative language supports the accumulative mode. A minor register drift occurs with "procedural generation," which feels slightly technical against the otherwise poetic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact is the phrase "procedural generation of her own life," which introduces a slightly technical register that is not fully taught or integrated into the voice, creating a small dissonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes a familiar premise (navigating alternate selves) with a fresh, specific execution through its accumulative, textural approach and the potent, concrete symbols of the viaduct and tablet. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally honest conclusion, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
