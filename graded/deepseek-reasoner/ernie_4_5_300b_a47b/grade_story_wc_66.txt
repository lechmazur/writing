<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear, rooted in personal history and necessity. Her micro-choices under pressure (scribbling lyrics, chasing the signal) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in her isolation and the weight of her purpose. A single minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language ("her motivation was not nobility but necessity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through the density of broadcast fragments. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira's purpose crystallizes, foreclosing a normal life with a visible cost of isolation. The final image of her stepping into the silent plains, carrying the stories, reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ember alcove and bioluminescent moss are not just described but actively constrain and enable Lira's actions, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional bias ("manuscript paper," "static-laced frequencies"). The environment subtly mirrors her internal state, as when the moss glows in waves with the strengthening signal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the density of lyric fragments, reweighting the dominant stake of preserving stories. The cost is legible in Lira's trembling fingers and the fading signal. Protagonist agency drives the escalation as she actively deciphers and chases the broadcast, narrowing her focus to this singular, vital task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of Lira's vocation, the story famine, and the pirate broadcasts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and voice: "she carried the stories inside her." Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of the mist sealing the alcove's secrets as she steps out, a quiet yet profound resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a lyrical, precise perceptual signature befitting a copyist. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with the scene's urgency, from the calm opening to the feverish writing. The elision of the broadcast lyrics is a taught, purposeful pattern that pays off at closure, enriching the narrative texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The alcove, carved into the side of a cliff... was her sanctuary" establishes setting, tone, and character). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single, hairline slip: "thistled calm" is slightly ambiguous but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-narrative-apocalypse world, a musical copyist, and pirate radio broadcasts is fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The emotional truth of Lira's quiet, determined quest feels authentic and avoids generic templates, grounded in lived-in detail like the father's cloak smelling of cedar.</comment>
