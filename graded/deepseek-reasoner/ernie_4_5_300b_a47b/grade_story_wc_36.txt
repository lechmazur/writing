<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, compelling his high-stakes choice. His embodied emotion ("throat tightened," "hands shook") and micro-choice to play the broken flute again reveal character under pressure. However, the final choice of "surrender" is more told than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: Kael accepts irreversible lesson and walks home with broken flute. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and cadence shifts that reweight the stake. The final image of etching "surrender" charges the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively pressures choices through its "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere and spatial constraints. The flute functions as micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image when it breaks. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional bias as a relic keeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Kael's decision to play a "discordant jumble of notes" directly triggers the starfield vision and flute's breaking. The cost is legible in the snapped reeds and irreversible lesson. One meaningful tightening (the vision of past failures) forces his final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of surrendering to failure emerges organically through concrete particulars: the broken flute, the new rune for surrender, and Kael's long walk home. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of weaving between worlds integrates fully with theme through specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose ("pierced the canyon hush like a needle through silk"). POV remains stable and deeply embodied. Purposeful compression in peak beats ("Enough!") supports pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("air thick with the scent of petrified pine and ozone"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final sentence achieves perfect cadence and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar fantasy elements through specific voice and setting. The concept of music's silence having power feels inevitable in hindsight. Some minor conventionality in the mentor specter trope prevents a higher score, but overall execution is highly original and risk-taking.</comment>
