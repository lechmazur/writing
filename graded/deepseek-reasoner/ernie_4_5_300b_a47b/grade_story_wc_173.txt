<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, her embodied emotion is strong, and her final choice is earned. The "chaste courtesan" contradiction is intriguing but remains a label; its specific, lived-in tension isn't fully dramatized on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost ("her spirit unburdened"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence. A slight ambiguity in the mechanics of the "unraveling" prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The prism sanctuary and the snow actively constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is vivid and selective, perfectly reflecting the scene's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the accumulative lens, building to a clear cadence shift. The cost of her effort is legible. The stake ("defy conformity") is slightly abstract, but the on-page action of the dance makes it visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of defiance through art emerges organically from the particulars of the dance and the echoes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled. The perceptual signature is strong. A few phrases verge on over-articulation ("bodily poetic movements"), but the voice remains coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but shows minor signs of overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "each flake fell like a whispered secret" followed by other dense metaphors). This creates a slight drag on momentum, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a courtesan in a prism sanctuary harvesting echoes is a fresh, specific synthesis. The concept feels organic and is executed with confidence. It avoids being derivative, though the core arc of artistic rebellion is a familiar one.</comment>
