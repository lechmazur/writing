<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's rationality and motivation are clear and consistent, compelling her higher-stakes choice to use the ledger. Her embodied emotion ("heart sinking") and micro-choice to use the eye feel earned. The final choice to "occlude" with truth is a credible endurance of her method, though its cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise; the decision to weaponize truth reconfigures options with conceptual cost. The inferred Causal lens holds tightly: Jorn's appearance because of the storm and the ledger's revelation therefore force Mara's choice. Orientation is immediate and the closure cost, while subtle, is legible in the final calm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("damp soil," "flickering lamplight"). The orchard and storm pressure the choice to seek shelter, and the hut provides the crucible for the climax. However, the setting does not decisively constrain the final choice or charge the image enough for the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from foraging to safeguarding a world-altering ledger. The dominant stake (psychological safety) tightens meaningfully under causal pressure from Jorn's revelation. Agency is clear in Mara's choice to act, though the cost of that choice remains more implied than starkly visible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of truth as a dangerous weapon emerges organically from the ledger and the eye's use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"occlude" with truth—that reweights the premise without moralizing. The integration of concept and character arc is seamless and sophisticated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, clinical texture that fits a rational forager. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The prose remains controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("chandelier of green") is purposeful and effective. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("The eye, he claimed,") and a near-paraphrase loop prevent a higher score, but clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-empathy virus world, a truth-revealing artifact, and a truffle forager is fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded character choices. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
