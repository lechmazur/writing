<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clara's characterization is precise and embodied, with her "devotedly observant" trait driving micro-choices like tracing constellations and scrutinizing documents. Her internal conflict between familial loyalty and truth is dramatized through her investigation, culminating in a credible, costly renunciation of her family's legacy. The final choice to testify and write op-eds is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her mother's weeping and the lawyers' demands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: the journalist's call triggers investigation, evidence discovery forces confrontation, and closure is a decisive change with cost (family rupture, public exposure). Orientation is immediate; closure lands on-page with the felt cost of her mother's call and the reconfiguration of her purpose ("dance in their gravity"). The pen nib's return charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered and pressures choices—its isolation focuses investigation, its library holds key evidence. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (it "bit into her palm") and charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though "gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat" slightly strains metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. family legacy) are signaled early and escalate through evidence discovery, tightening options. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to investigate and later share proof forces a trade-off with visceral cost (family backlash). One meaningful tightening (finding the memo) forecloses innocence and reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth's cost and cyclical regret) emerges organically through the nib's symbolism and Clara's arc, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("truth... a compass") but slightly over-relies on the "orbits of regret" concept as a thematic echo in the final paragraph, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature blending astronomical and moral lexicon ("orbits of regret," "black hole"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (journalist exchange). Elision (e.g., the investigation montage) is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and strong verbs ("gnawed," "unearth"). Minor artifacts: "spidery handwriting" is a cliché, and "celestial heartbeat" metaphor is slightly mixed. However, rhythm controls pressure effectively, and closure beats are clear and artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical observation and moral reckoning feels fresh and inevitable. The nib's transformation from relic to tool of truth is specific and grounded. Some familiarity in the "heiress exposes corruption" premise limits originality, but execution elevates it through voice and symbolic depth.</comment>
