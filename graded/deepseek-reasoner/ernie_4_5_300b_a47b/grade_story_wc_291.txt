<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's face-blindness and methodical empathy are embodied through specific perceptual filters ("texture, shadow, and the way light pooled in hollows") and drive her micro-choices, like handing Voss the charcoal. Her final choice to frame the ribbon is an earned renunciation that forecloses a path with the visible cost of carrying the case's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern recognition ("the quarry’s geometry became a language"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the locket's discovery, which reconfigures the case from cold evidence to human connection with a felt cost in Clara's tightened throat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quarry is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Its mist, stone, and the pit's "abyssal mouth" pressure the investigation and are woven into the closure's portrait ("Lila’s shadow, etched into stone"). Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, reflecting Clara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Clara's sketching and Voss's examination tighten the investigation through a cadence shift. The cost is legible in the collaborative discovery of the handprint and locket, which narrow options and force the case's reopening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of opposites (hard/soft, forgetting/remembering) and is resolved through the final, non-literal image of the portrait. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question of empathy without moralizing, reweighting the cold case through lived particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, filtered through Clara's artistic perception. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("You think art can solve what logic can’t?"). Minor register drift in "furrowed hush" slightly disrupts the voice's consistency but does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory density. A minor figurative pile-up occurs in the opening simile ("like a second skin, blurring... into ghosts"), and the phrase "furrowed hush" is a slight register drift, but these do not harm closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind artist solving cold cases through empathy is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, feeling inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
