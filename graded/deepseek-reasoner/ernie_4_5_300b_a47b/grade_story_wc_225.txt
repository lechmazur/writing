<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied flaw (guilt over the prince's death). His micro-choices, like plucking the black thread, reveal his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of guilt is earned by the on-page causality of decoding the tapestry. A slight deduction for the prince's memory feeling slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inferred causal lens holds: Alaric's actions (kneeling, approaching, plucking, following) drive the plot. Closure is a decisive change (time unfreezes) with a resonant reconfiguration (his self-forgiveness). The cost is legible in the "weight on his chest lifting." A minor deduction for the "woven hush" concept feeling slightly abstract upon its introduction, creating a small lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and the tapestry are not just described; they are the primary tools that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Alaric's expertise (e.g., "threads that pulsed like living veins"). The setting actively pressures the protagonist throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the act of decoding the threads is a meaningful tightening that narrows his options and changes his knowledge. The cost of confronting his past failure is felt on the page, charging the final resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of decoding the tapestry's threads, representing guilt, hope, and regret. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("some threads couldn’t be untangled—only woven into something new") that reweights the prior material without moralizing. It embraces complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, tutor's voice that colors descriptions ("winnowed deeper"). The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping, and the limited dialogue in the memory fragment is character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("fierce repose" following "deliberate" steps) and a potentially mixed metaphor in "woven hush" (though it pays off). These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The combination of a chess tutor in a time-frozen village feels fresh and specific. The core mechanism of decoding a tapestry to unravel a temporal curse is an original, non-obvious synthesis of ideas. The story commits fully to its premise, though the concept is not groundbreakingly unique.</comment>
