<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, with embodied emotion ("the key tag burned against his thigh"). His internal conflict between truth and ghost-chasing is dramatized, and his final renunciation is earned with visible cost when he places the key tag down. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on summary in the backstory block, but it remains anchored to the present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and emotional weight. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias reconfigures his understanding of sound and memory, with cost legible in the final image of him walking home, the symphony humming in his veins. The orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The sunken library's door marked "13" is a pivotal constraint, and the "meteor hush" atmosphere is maintained throughout, evolving to illuminate the corridors like a cathedral at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the discovery in the library, which reweights the dominant stake of understanding sound. The cost is felt in Elias's emotional realization and the act of leaving the key behind, a tangible forfeiture that alters his stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of sound as the color of memory emerges organically from the library's inscription and Lila's final words, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer. The final image of the "symphony only he could hear" avoids moralizing and offers a profound, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice ("wooden planks groaned like old bones") that modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanism of the library's preservation) is taught and pays off in the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("its mast a skeletal finger"), and sentences propel the narrative forward without scaffolding or loops. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken library, the color of sound, and a lamplighter's grief is highly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded particulars, and the risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
