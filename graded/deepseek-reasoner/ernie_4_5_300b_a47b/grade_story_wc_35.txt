<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nessar's motivation ("to sandpaper rough memories") is clear, rooted in his unique ability, and intensifies under pressure. His final choice to subsume the founder's guilt is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as he staggers and the guards' softened expressions signal shared burden. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing, though one borderline diagnostic moment ("analyzing them was his method") slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Nessar's act of subsuming guilt reconfigures the fortress's emotional weight, with cost legible in his unsteady legs and the salt-stiff apron. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and a cadence shift at the pool. The persistent constraint of the pavilion's contagious nature shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress and coral pavilion are vividly specific and purposefully integrated, constraining choice (the door yields only to specific ritual) and charging the final image (salt-stiff apron, tempered brittleness). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with the scent of wet stone and arctic air reflecting Nessar's urgency and professional bias. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the pool's tidal formations deepening to mirror Nessar's guilt and force his consequential choice. The cost is unmistakable as he gasps and embodies the founder's remorse, with the burden visibly diluting across the fortress. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the final cooking scene offering a resonant, non-literal answer to handling remorse through nourishment rather than erasure. Subtext operates in implication (guards' softened expressions, the unspoken dream). The piece avoids moralizing, embracing complexity through the founder's guilt and Nessar's tempered endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Nessar's culinary sensibility ("bitter herb," "recipe"). Diction remains within his lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "subsumed") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though one minor scaffold phrase ("analyzing them was his method") and a slight register elevation ("emotionally contagious nature") prevent a higher score. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. No loops or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-tasting, stored remorse, and a desert fortress feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric compression, emotional contagion) heightening stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, resisting template plots.</comment>
