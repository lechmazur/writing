<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His decision to leave his mother's locket is a credible, earned renunciation with visible cost. The only minor slip is a slight diagnostic feel in "Some burdens are anchors," but it's quickly anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is clearly Causal, with tight because/therefore linkages. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kael chooses not to melt his mother's burden, foreclosing a path with a felt cost. The final image of the fractals shifting in his satchel reconfigures the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and kerosene lamp function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, with the "shingled hush" and "whalebone reverie" creating a cohesive, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, with the obsidian block providing a meaningful tightening that tests Kael's skill and resolve. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and the "sound like a heart breaking." The dominant stake of collecting weights is consistently pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict of collecting weights, not wounds, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with Kael's renunciation at his mother's niche. The final image of the restless fractals offers a charged ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("air tasted of wet metal and old prayers"). The voice is controlled and purposefully lyrical, with any elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. One minor figurative muddle occurs with "the grotto’s damp throat," which slightly violates the established physical logic of the setting, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a fractal weaver melting calcified burdens is a highly original, non-obvious synthesis. The specific, grounded choices in world logic and character motive make it feel inevitable and fresh, with bold risk-taking that coheres perfectly.</comment>
