<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in loss, compelling his high-stakes choice to rupture the step. His internal contradiction ("grim optimist") is shown through action, and his final renunciation is earned. The "balancedly daring" trait is more told than shown, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Kael accepts the symbolic motion, foreclosing his quest with a felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density around the concept of motion and loss. The cost is legible in the final image of the dice spinning out of reach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("ozone and regret"). The recurring dice constrain action and their final orbit is the story's central, resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive act of rupture. The stake (capturing loss) is clear and the cost of achieving perpetual motion only to let it go is legible. A single, meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of loss and motion is fully integrated, emerging from particulars (the dice, the proofs, the rupture) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the texture of loss is the space between the spinning dice, not the object itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. The voice is consistent, and the lyrical compression ("a wound that heals by bleeding forever") is taught and pays off. Minor register drift in the mathematical proof description prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("stone that shimmered like aged parchment"). Rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mathematical concept (perpetual motion) with a deeply personal quest for emotional closure is fresh and organic. The infinite staircase as a setting for this exploration is ingenious. The concept is fully committed to without retreat.</comment>
