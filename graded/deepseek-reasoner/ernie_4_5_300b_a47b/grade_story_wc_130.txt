<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in ambiguous loss, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion during the ritual. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling fingers and mixed tears. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing in the epiphany ("embracing the chaos").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost when the mosaic shifts and she feels his presence as a "current in the air." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern resonance. The brother's metaphor ("emotion isn't a straight line") teaches the pattern early, paid off at closure. No orientation issues; anchors are clear by line 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard constrains choice and charges the final image—the stalactites feed the soil, the mosaic stone enables the ritual, and the fruit pulses with her heartbeat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through her expertise (e.g., "mineral-rich water"). The setting evolves causally with the ritual's progression, narrowing perception to immediacies under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens—her ritual action ("pouring a vial of luminescent sap") deepens stakes through pattern resonance. Cost is legible when the trees shudder and her breath fogs the glass, foreclosing her prior static grief. One meaningful tightening suffices, narrowing options from seeking answers to embracing fractal loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the brother's mosaic metaphor and the final image of the constellations. Subtext operates in the chipped eyes and fractal patterns, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: loss as a living, reshaping force. No moralizing; the reconfiguration arises from concrete particulars (sap, stone, chips).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature ("dripping stalactites fed the soil"). Syntax and rhythm reflect her conjurer's mindset, modulating under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "gnawing sort") is taught early. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, accelerating with the ritual's hum. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("mathematics of emotion") and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final line resolves with image-driven momentum: "even in the silence, there was movement."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes taxidermy and conjuring through specific, grounded choices. The core premise (ambiguous loss as fractal) offers a fresh angle, transformed via the brother's glass eyes and orchard magic. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
