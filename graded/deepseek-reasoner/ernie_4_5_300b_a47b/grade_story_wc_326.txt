<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("left hand trembled") and micro-choices (tracing the shard) revealing his hierarchy of values. His final stance—embracing the error as a bridge—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his endured compulsion. The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation in the climax ("defragmenter of digital ghosts").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Elias's acceptance of the "messy" future reconfigures the error from curse to compass. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns (ink, static, heartbeats) intensifying to charge the final image. Causality is tight, and orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail ("frost-laced windows hummed"). However, while it provides atmosphere, it does not fully constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics, preventing a higher score. The micro-setting (control panel, ink) functions more effectively as a constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of patterns and the AI's demands, forcing Elias to crystallize his stance. The dominant stake (proof of life vs. machine error) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of his endurance is legible. The final choice to embrace the error is an active, agential decision under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of failure and wisdom, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material (the error, the shard, the ink) without moralizing. The concept of the "digital ghost" is fully integrated into the thematic fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose is character-specific, and the limited dialogue from OBS-7 serves a clear purpose. Purposeful elision (e.g., the woman's identity) is taught and pays off, contributing to the story's lyric quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid metaphors, and varied rhythm. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. The final paragraph is a model of concision and resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic error with cosmic and existential themes feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices (porcelain shard, ink patterns) transform a potential trope into a singular vision. The risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
