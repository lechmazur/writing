<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood curiosity, compelling her high-stakes choice to burn the negative. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied emotion ("throat tightened") and a micro-choice that alters her goal. The final renunciation feels earned, though a touch more contradictory impulse in the moment of discovery would have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory density and motif repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with clear cost—the burning of the negative—and the final image of the locket reconfigures meaning. The lens holds, though the initial cause of the wall's groan is slightly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("smelled of wet earth and iron"). The environment is inextricably woven into the action and ultimately reveals the climactic alcove, directly shaping the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the discovery of the diaries, which deepens Lira's knowledge and fundamentally reweights her goal. The dominant stake (discovering the walls' dreams) is tested and transformed by her agency. The cost of her choice to burn the relic is legible and alters the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of legacy and memory emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the diaries, the negative, and the final locket. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the powerful image and whisper ("You are the map"). It avoids moralizing, instead achieving a profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, perceptive signature ("tracing the spine of a forgotten map"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's professional and personal lens. The voice modulates beautifully with emotional intensity without losing coherence or specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists ("sensitively perceptive" feels slightly telling). However, the prose is largely concise, vivid, and propulsive, with figurative language that consistently enhances rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—a cartographer of echoes seeking what walls dream—is strikingly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The combination of climate-shift atmosphere, lived-in architecture, and thematic depth feels organic and singular. The final synthesis feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
