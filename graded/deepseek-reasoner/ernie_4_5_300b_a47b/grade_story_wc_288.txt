<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique existence as a bridge between epochs. Her final choice to document for herself is earned by prior causality, with the cost of renouncing her ghostly chorus legible in her whispered declaration, "I see you, but I am not you." Embodied emotion is strong, particularly in the tactile interaction with the sundial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lirael chooses independence, foreclosing the path of collective memory with a visible cost. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout, with pressure escalating through the intensifying hum and coalescing images. The final image of her writing her own story reconfigures the library's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal library and brass sundial are not merely vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The sundial's evolving use from a reflective object to a key directly shapes Lirael's tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the accumulative lens, as her decision to engage with the sundial's images forces a final, costly choice. The dominant stake of translating isolation into independence is tested and resolved on the page. The cost of her renunciation is felt in the library's new, solitary rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of "brittle awakenings," resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of independence through the image of her writing her own book. The final paragraph's "pioneer of the living" reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent lyrical and perceptive voice suited to the character and setting. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, particularly in passages describing the library's energy. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not applied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("ink shimmered like liquid starlight") is pattern-taught and serves the atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with the hum's crescendo and the subsequent stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of extinction, memory, and independence. The combination of the tidal library, atomically reflective sundial, and stone circle's hum feels organic and indispensable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
