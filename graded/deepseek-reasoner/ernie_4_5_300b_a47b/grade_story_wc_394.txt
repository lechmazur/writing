<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in specific obsession ("steadily curious" muttering, embodied trembling). Her final choice to launch is earned by prior causality (kaleidoscope revelation, arrow tip alignment). Internal contradiction shown through scoffing at Thrum's riddles yet persisting. Micro-choices under pressure (pressing arrow to glass, mounting glider) reveal values hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly: kaleidoscope images directly motivate actions ("converting each flicker into a tweak"). Closure is decisive change (bell hums) with visible cost (gears halt, sea roars). Orientation anchored by ~120 words (workshop, acid sea, glider). Persistent constraint (arrow tip's spirals) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (acid mist eats tools, sulfurous wind enables flight). Vivid sensory detail ("air tasted of rust", "gears screaming") filtered through POV. Micro-setting (kaleidoscope, arrow tip) charges final image. Spatial choreography coherent (glider mounting, dive trajectory).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (each kaleidoscope image forces new tactic). Cost legible on page (tools corroding, glider straining). Dominant stake (ringing bell) tightens through meaningful deepening (images reveal crash risk). No coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and action (yearning→motion conversion). Ending offers resonant non-literal answer (hum "unspooling the future"). Avoids moralizing. Minor deduction for near-thematic echo in Old Thrum's "seen not solved" line, though dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of rust and possibility"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("She transliterated wildly"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression (Thrum's backstory) taught and paid off. Diction consistent with POV's technical-poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful ("skeletal frame of whirring gears"). Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs (short sentences during climax). No register drift or template cadence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk and algorithmic mysticism. Premise fully committed to with specific lived detail (acid sea, slag heap). Risk-taking (lyric-technical hybrid voice) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
