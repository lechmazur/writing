<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is consistent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or a visible struggle that would elevate the portrayal. Her "spiralingly calm" attribute is shown effectively, yet it functions more as a stable trait than a source of complex, flawed decision-making under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the canal's softened whispers and lingering patterns providing a felt cost to Lira's intervention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence, though the causal linkage between her actions and the canal's response remains subtly implied rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock and dental mirror are indispensable, high-specificity elements that actively constrain Lira's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception, creating a cohesive and atmospheric world that pressures the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (soothing the canal's tension) is clear, and a single meaningful deepening occurs. However, escalation feels gradual and accumulative rather than driven by acute, on-page pressure that forces a difficult trade-off or a visibly costly choice from Lira, limiting the intensity under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of silent empathy and teaching light to darkness is fully integrated, emerging with powerful resonance from Lira's specific actions and the final image. It avoids moralizing, offering a non-literal answer that reweights the story's core concept without a hint of sentimentality or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a controlled, lyrical rhythm that supports the accumulative mode. A slight tendency toward ornate description ("bruised sky like a bruise on glass") creates minor register drift in the opening, but the POV remains stable and the voice is largely effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm, though it occasionally leans into overwriting ("a shadow without a voice") and a repetitive simile ("like a bruise on glass"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent guardian using a dental mirror to weave light patterns is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular vision, transforming its elements into a fresh and memorable whole.</comment>
