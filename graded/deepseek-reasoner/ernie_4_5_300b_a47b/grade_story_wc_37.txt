<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to act as a conduit. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her exhaustion. However, her internal contradiction is more summarized than simultaneously acted upon in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost ("exhausted but peaceful"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift from observation to active humming. The final image reconfigures the realm's possibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard and mica windows are indispensable, actively constraining Lira's choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the environment functioning as a crucible that pressures and enables the protagonist's goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to active participation. The cost of her effort is legible on the page. A single, meaningful intensification from passive witnessing to active song-weaving is sufficient and effectively narrows her options, fully earning the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory and community emerges organically from concrete events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "woven dawns," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong, with a consistent, voice-motivated diction. Minor register drift occurs in the phrase "a bound release of hope," which feels slightly elevated compared to the surrounding text, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but a tendency toward stacked figurative language creates minor density issues in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fruit that glowed like captured stars—plums of molten gold, pears that dripped liquid twilight"). This slightly slows momentum without fully obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an alchemical orchard, a memory keeper, and "woven dawns" is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated concept. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, making the story's logic feel inevitable and singular.</comment>
