<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific obsession, and intensifies to compel the climactic choice. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied perception ("retrocognitively trapped," head spinning) rather than alternating summaries. The final renunciation of her goal for a new understanding is earned by the prior causality of the experiment's cost. A slight deduction for the final beat's clarity; the shift from wanting to touch time to wanting to remember is profound but could be slightly more legible in its micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds strongly. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara renounces her original goal, foreclosing that path with the visible cost of the inert halo fragment and the loss of her visions, and gains a new understanding. Causality is tight, with each beat—studying photos, using the fragment, the garden's reaction—driving the next. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's "dull and inert" fragment and "visions were gone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not a postcard setting; it actively pressures Elara's choices and supplies the key resources (photographs, bridge, geometry) that directly affect the outcome. The environment constrains and enables her entire experiment, and its reformation is the story's decisive change. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's professional and obsessive POV ("pulsed like veins," "hummed," "tasted of salt and regret").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency: her decision to use the fragment triggers the garden's reaction, which narrows her options and overwhelms her, forcing the climactic choice to press on. The cost is unmistakable: the disintegration of the bridge and her visions. The dominant stake (discovering time's texture) is tested and ultimately reweighted by her actions. A minor deduction as the final cost, while felt, is slightly conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of time as a story, not a texture, emerges entirely from the events and the final image of the stabilized photographs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates powerfully in the garden's reformation and the fragment going inert. The ending avoids moralizing, instead achieving earned wisdom through the specific, dramatized cost of Elara's experiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's specific, professional-obsessive perception ("hyperbolic geometry," "pixelate, dissolving into a swarm of fireflies"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping or unmotivated elision. The voice is singular and consistent under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. However, a minor instance of overwriting occurs in the high-pressure beat: "dissolving into a swarm of fireflies" is a slightly mixed metaphor (pixelation + insects) that briefly muddles clarity. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, and the final lines are clear and resonant. This minor artifact prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a living garden, retrocognition, a celestial artifact, and hyperbolic geometry into a coherent, character-driven narrative is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on time manipulation tropes. The story commits fully to its weird, specific logic, and the final reconfiguration feels earned rather than clever. The risk-taking with figurative language largely pays off.</comment>
