<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and a micro-choice to teach others that earns its cost. The Hollywood fragment's resonance is character-particular, though her flaw could be more contradictory in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost under an Accumulative lens; the shard's opening reweights silence from absence to potential. Lunar perigee's gravitational role is somewhat implied rather than causally tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tower city constrains choice through swaying cables and charged isolation; the gorge's mist and mineral scent are woven into action. The fragment and dish actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's tuning under pressure, narrowing options to find the hush; cost is legible in her dawn realization. The lunar window could tighten tactics more causally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard's revelation that silence holds potential, resisting moralizing; the ending reweights beginnings without statement. The final image resonates non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; compression ("the shard of hush opened like a door") serves closure. Minor register drift in "electromagnetic poetry" but controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, though "serenely electric pulses" mildly clashes with POV lexicon. No loops or artifacts; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic silence and practical magic; the Hollywood fragment's specificity and risk-taking heighten stakes. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
