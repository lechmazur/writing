<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cassia's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her past as a failed revolutionary, which credibly motivates her present drive for preservation. Her final choice to "reimagine" the Venusians is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of her own defeat burnished into her worldview. A hairline deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("emotion she couldn't quite name") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density of detail and a cadence shift at the shard's revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Cassia's plan to resurrect the civilization reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. The final image of the temporal storm paints the cost legibly on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is not merely decorative; it actively pressures the scene through its absurd grandeur and the covered mirrors, which are used to explain the temporal mechanics. The shard itself functions as a micro-setting, constraining choice and decisively charging the final image with its pulsating warmth and whispered ghosts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification via the shard's revelation, which reweights the dominant stake (artifacts vs. souls) with clear cost. Protagonist agency drives the turn, as Cassia actively angles the shard to prove her point, forcing a shift in Huang's stance and narrowing his options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose through defeat emerges organically from the juxtaposition of Cassia's past and the Venusians' fate. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "liquid history," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration of concept (archaeology) and theme is flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature filtered through Cassia's poetic and tactical mind. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries distinct subtext between the two characters. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, with purposeful compression in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. A minor prose artifact occurs in the peak beat with "emotion she couldn't quite name," which trends toward diagnostic label-speak and slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque space asteroid, visible timestreams, and archaeological ethics feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with profound implications, transforming the familiar "first contact" trope through a lens of defeat and preservation. A clear, bold risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
