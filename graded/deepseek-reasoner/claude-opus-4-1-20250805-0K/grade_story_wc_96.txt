<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong interiority and clear motivation rooted in forging beauty from anarchy; monthly molting is a credible method, not madness. Embodied emotion present (crouching, touching the tin), but minimal on-page internal conflict limits the highest band. Marcus backstory is well-anchored and tilts present stance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise (touching the coffee tin) with cost legible in the final image of revolution growing. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is tight through patterned escalation (rebuilding, names) that reweights stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the rusted library constrains choice (open roof allows light but risk), and the coffee tin charges the final image. Sensory details (moonlight like liquid silver) are integrated into action and reflect POV bias.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resistance) escalates accumulatively through rebuilding and the tin's contents, narrowing options. Protagonist agency drives escalation; cost is felt in the risk of her work. One meaningful deepening (moonlight illuminating pages) suffices for length.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (beauty from anarchy) emerges organically through concrete particulars (rebuilt anthology, monthly names). Subtext in objects (tin, books); ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with poetic texture ("molted personalities," "luminous fractures"). No dialogue; elision (past events) is taught and paid off at closure. Syntax and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors ("like liquid silver") are coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting accumulative escalation and closure.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vagrant poet, resistance, and artistic rebellion feels inevitable. Specific details (Neruda, Rumi pages) avoid tropes; risk-taking in structure (accumulative) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Authentic vision.</comment>
