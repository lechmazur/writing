<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied, with her olfactory sensitivity guiding her actions and her ambition transforming into patient wisdom. Her final choice to embrace the flower's stench is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she overcomes her sensitive nature. Internal conflict is shown, not summarized, through her initial frustration and gradual alignment with the village's sway.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory density and pattern breaks toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with cost as Mira sways with the flower's scent, rooted in understanding. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (dew collection, suspended garden) and charging the final image. The treetop village's perpetual motion and the corpse flower's growth are tactile and purpose-driven. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with the environment actively shaping Mira's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her embodied acceptance of the flower's stench. The dominant stake (mastery through patience) tightens through her journalizing and sensory attunement, foreclosing her impulsive earlier self. Pressure coheres through density increases and cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like sketching and swaying, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to serenity within motion, reweighting prior imagery. Subtext operates in silence and implication, with the flower's odor reinterpreted as communication, not corruption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by olfactory focus. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., "Days dissolved into weeks") is purposeful and taught. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure, with diction matching Mira's herbalist worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("like steam from a witch's cauldron") is pattern-taught and payoff-aligned. Syntax varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar elements (apprentice story, unique setting) through specific, grounded choices. The treetop village and corpse flower are irreplaceable, transforming tropes via lived detail. Risk-taking in sensory focus heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
