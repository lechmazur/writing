<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaspar's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, embodied regret. His final choice of self-forgiveness is earned through on-page struggle with the tapestry, though his flaw is more a past error than a present blind spot actively complicating choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens fits best; pressure builds through layered realizations. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost—the acceptance of an unchangeable past. The mechanism of the woven hush, while evocative, is not fully taught, creating a slight causality ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is a masterful, integral setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through Kaspar's perception, making the environment a active participant in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening as Kaspar decodes the tapestry. The cost of his past mistake and the weight of his self-forgiveness are legible on the page, driven by his agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the chess game and frozen village. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about acceptance and imperfect moves without moralizing. The integration of concept and character arc is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, perfectly modulating with emotional intensity. The elision of the hush's mechanics is a minor, purposeful compression that doesn't harm legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("raindrops hung like glass beads") is precise and purposeful. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure sense or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chess parable with a magical time-stasis is fresh and non-obvious. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high emotional specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking in the quiet, introspective climax heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
