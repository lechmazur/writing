<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sarai's contradictory impulses (mercy vs. guilt, restoration vs. creation) are dramatized through embodied micro-choices like pressing the tessera and weeping from "strange, cold warmth." Her final renunciation of restoration for creation is earned by prior causality, though the epiphany's diagnostic phrasing ("understanding flooding through her") slightly dulls the immediacy of the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds: tessera use triggers visions that accumulate pressure, culminating in the causal choice to reinterpret her curse. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she sees a future possibility, with cost legible in her "purpose sharp as winter wind." Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shattered sky and mosaic stones are not just vivid backdrop; they actively constrain and enable Sarai's choices, charging the final image. The plaza's chipped patterns are the literal method of her transformation, and the "shattered sky's strange light" becomes a resource in the envisioned future.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (personal redemption/meaningful legacy) escalate under the hybrid lens: each vision deepens her knowledge, and the old man's arrival applies direct pressure. Her agency—pressing the stone, reinterpreting her purpose—drives the final, decisive intensification and reconfiguration with a clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as transformative, not pure) emerges entirely through scene work and image, not statement. The final reconfiguration—from restoring the past to creating the future—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of aberrant mercy's value and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Sarai's perceptual signature ("strange, cold warmth," "purpose sharp as winter wind"). The prose's lyrical, compressed quality is voice-motivated and taught early. The single dialogue exchange is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight register drift in "understanding flooding through her" and a potential paraphrase loop between "retrocognitively trapped but finally free." These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—retrocognition as a curse that is an invitation—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The story fully commits to its implications, transforming the familiar "broken world" trope through specific, grounded choices in character and a unique magical mechanic that is inextricably tied to theme.</comment>
