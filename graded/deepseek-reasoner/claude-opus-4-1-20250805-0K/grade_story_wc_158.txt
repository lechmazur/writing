<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's characterization is vivid and specific, with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in transformation. However, the "shyly unstoppable" trait is more told than shown; her actions on the page are almost entirely decisive, lacking the contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict that would elevate the score into the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of light through the worn postcard. The lens is consistent, though its accumulative nature isn't explicitly taught until the midpoint, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is an indispensable, micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception, creating a fully embodied and constraining environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of centuries of work is felt, though the pressure feels more ambient than actively tightening, as the protagonist's agency is more about enduring and attracting than making escalating choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges organically from concrete particulars—the lullabies, the postcard, the burned poems—culminating in a resonant, non-literal final image. It avoids moralizing and embraces complexity, though the core concept ("blossom armistice") is occasionally stated rather than purely shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptually signature way of noticing. The prose is controlled and purposeful, though a few phrases like "reef-shadow joy" and "photosynthesize pain" verge on repetitive, slightly diminishing the distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight synonym churn (e.g., "transform"/"photosynthesize"/"transmute") and the repetitive use of the "photosynthesize" metaphor, which, while thematically relevant, appears multiple times without significant variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic shell, a galactic postcard, and a floral armistice is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a committed lyrical stance, creating a singular and memorable vision.</comment>
