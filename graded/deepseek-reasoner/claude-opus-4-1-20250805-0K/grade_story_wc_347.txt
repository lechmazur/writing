<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—her desire for freedom versus her duty—act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she gives away the walnut. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("she would remain here"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is Earned Stasis with undeniable cost in the final image of frost sealing the labyrinth. The blueprint's mystery persists as a constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with taught disorientation (inverted trees) that serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and inverted trees actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("copper wings catching the last amber light"). The walnut recurs with reweighted meaning, functioning as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—Mara's choice to give the walnut deepens the stakes irrevocably. The cost is unmistakable on the page ("she would remain here"). The live clock ("three hours until frost") tightens decisions meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to themes of sacrifice and duty through the final image of frost and inverted trees. Subtext operates powerfully in the walnut's dual meaning. Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure ("graceless beauty of survival"). POV is stable and voice-consistent. Brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Elision (blueprint's full secret) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("trees that grew backward into the earth"). Minor scaffold in middle reflection block ("she'd discovered this ability...") but doesn't harm closure. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and melancholy realism feels inevitable. The inverted orchard concept is transformed through specific character choices. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative template echoes.</comment>
