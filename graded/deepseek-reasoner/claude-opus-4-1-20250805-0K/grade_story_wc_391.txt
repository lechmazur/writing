<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific worldview, with her patience and precision vividly embodied. The final choice to redirect the viaduct feels earned by her seventeen years of study. A slight deduction for the backstory of the Council and viaduct's history, which is summarized rather than fully integrated into her immediate, on-page micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through the patient placement of rods. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the viaduct hums a new tune and the cost of newfound freedom is felt in the "confusion in distant cities." The structure is taut and purposeful, with a clear before-and-after change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are not merely decorative; they are essential to the plot's mechanics and charge the final image. The environment constrains choice (placing rods in cracks) and the specific, sensory details ("hexagonal faces glazed with ice") are filtered through Kira's professional perspective, creating a fully immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a steady, purposeful deepening of stakes as Kira and Tomás enact their plan. The dominant stake (freeing humanity's thoughts) is clear and the cost of success—the potential for panic—is made legible on the page. The tension is maintained through the precise, ritualistic action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of patient, accumulative revolution is masterfully integrated, emerging from the specific actions of tracking moon paths and placing copper rods. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, comparing revolution to "water working through stone." It avoids moralizing, trusting the reader to infer the theme from the particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, controlled rhythm that mirrors Kira's restrained wildness. The narrative voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to geological time and magnetic energy. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot without disruption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density. Sentences like "sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt" do multiple jobs. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The rhythm is purposeful and varies effectively to match the scene's quiet intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a magnetic-viaduct revolution is fresh and specific. The combination of geological patience, lunar tracking, and a soft coup is a non-obvious synthesis that feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The story fully commits to its singular vision without hedging or relying on familiar tropes.</comment>
