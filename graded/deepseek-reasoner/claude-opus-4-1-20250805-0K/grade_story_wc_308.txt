<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Yula's characterization is profound and consistent, with her stillness serving as a powerful, earned renunciation. Her embodied emotion is strong, though a minor deduction for a near-diagnostic line ("her historically reverent nature") in a peak beat. The final endurance is deeply motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the returning pulse of her younger self confirms her achieved state. The cost of three centuries of stillness is legible in the final image and weathered resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are not just vivid description; they are the central mechanism of the plot, functioning as a library of sound that Yula learns to navigate. The setting constrains her choice to remain motionless and directly charges the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift—the arrival of the swallows and the returning pulse. This deepens the stakes and reweights the dominant stake of mastering navigation through stillness. The cost of centuries of waiting is the price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of movement through stillness is fully integrated and emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the canyon and Yula's practice. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the concept of journey without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the contemplative, accumulative nature of the story. The prose has a distinct rhythmic and perceptual signature, with purposeful elision (e.g., the mechanics of her skill) that is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic yet precise prose. There is a single, minor instance of potential register drift ("historically reverent nature") but it is brief and does not harm clarity or momentum. The final paragraph is a masterclass in resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical setting, a unique skill set, and a profound philosophical concept feels entirely fresh and inevitable. The core premise of navigating time through acoustic stillness is a significant, coherent risk that pays off with stunning originality and conceptual integrity.</comment>
