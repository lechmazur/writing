<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is strong, with a clear, motivated internal shift from rigid exorcist to collaborative participant. Her apology and subsequent choice to help are earned by the on-page revelation of her past error. A minor deduction for the brief, slightly diagnostic summary of her column's philosophy, which abstracts her stance rather than embodying it in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (RR) via a charged poise: the requiem's completion allows Elisabetta to leave, reconfiguring Vera's understanding of her work. The hybrid (causal/accumulative) drive lens holds: the chainsaws provide causal pressure, while the scent and music accumulate meaning. The cost is legible in the final image of the empty, unglowing bottle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and dying orchard are not just backdrop; they actively constrain the action and charge the final image. The orchard's destruction provides the deadline, and the archive houses the requiem's fragments. Sensory details like "bergamot and old roses" are purposeful and filtered through Vera's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (finish the requiem before the orchard is gone) and escalate through the causal pressure of the falling trees. Vera's agency is central to the escalation—her choice to participate is the key turn that narrows options and enables closure. The cost is the permanent loss of the spirit, felt through the empty bottle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" and collaboration over extraction is deeply integrated, emerging from the specific action of co-creating the requiem. The final paragraph's metaphors are earned, not stated, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to deal with ghosts and past mistakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, metaphor-rich quality that suits the ethereal subject matter. The prose effectively blends Vera's professional and personal perceptions. The dialogue between Marcus and the interwoven spirit voice is clean and serves to advance the plot and reveal character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong and evocative, with high information density. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in phrases like "imperfect miracles" and "damage became a door," which edge toward thematic statement. However, the rhythm is controlled and supports the story's contemplative yet urgent pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of exorcism, musicology, and familial legacy feels fresh and specific. The core concept of "reconnection" is transformed through the unique mechanism of scent-induced collaboration. The choice to set the climax during an orchard's destruction is a bold, non-obvious risk that heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
