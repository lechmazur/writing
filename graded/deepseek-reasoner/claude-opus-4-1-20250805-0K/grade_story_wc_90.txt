<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's steadfast pacifism is embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure, particularly her recoil and subsequent steadying when facing the shadow dimension's violence. Her final choice to stitch rather than fight arises from established causality and training, with the cost of integration felt in the ship's transformation. The emotional progression from weighty knowledge to weightless joy feels earned and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (RR) via conceptual repricing: the barrier ceases to exist, integrating humanity's shadow. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern density (tears, photographs) until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the ship's groaning transformation and Mei's final, tempered joy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recycled ship constrains choice by housing the photographs central to the method, and its transformation charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (opalescent sheen of tears, patchwork hull). The micro-setting of the meditation chamber and the vial are fully integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the accumulative lens: her patient search for the fracture and decisive use of the Tear. The dominant stake (humanity's integration) is signaled early and tightens through her focused meditation. The cost is the irreversible act of opening and the felt release of integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of integrating light and shadow emerges entirely through concrete action and image (stitching, ship transformation). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of wholeness, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the object of the tears and the act of stitching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("weightless with a joy tempered by understanding"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor overwriting appears in a few phrases ("singular purpose," "ghostly resolve...luminous acceptance") which slightly soften the precision of peak beats. However, information density is high and momentum is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi setting with Buddhist philosophy feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core concept of shadow work is transformed through the specific, grounded mechanics of the photographs and stitching. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable based on the established pattern.</comment>
