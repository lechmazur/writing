<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in her post-accident somatic awareness, compelling her higher-stakes choice to demonstrate her discovery. Her "willowglass hope" embodies a credible, fragile endurance. However, David's shift from skeptic to believer, while thematically satisfying, occurs rapidly and could benefit from more on-page micro-choices to fully earn the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as David steps into the light structure, making their shared wonder and the story's conceptual stakes tangible. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the increasing density of light patterns and somatic cues. The cost of Maya's permanent neurological alteration is the persistent constraint that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio and the muscovite geode sliver function as a micro-setting that directly constrains and enables Maya's choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her professional and altered perceptual priorities, such as the "dendrites of possibility branching through space."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Maya's agency, as she crushes the pill to intensify the light patterns, forcing a demonstration that narrows David's options from skepticism to participatory wonder. The cost is legible in her somatic markers and the foreclosed path of conventional pharmaceutical solutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of connection through somatic wisdom emerges organically from the core concept and concrete events, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "illuminated architecture," reweighting the premise without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature shaped by Maya's unique somatic awareness. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with purposeful compression, such as "willowglass hope." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing plot and revealing character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative language in high-pressure beats ("dendrites of possibility") is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle. A single instance of potential register drift ("fractally precise") is minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of neuro-perceptual alteration, recalled pharmaceuticals, and light art feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed without retreat, resulting in a singular artistic stance that heightens stakes.</comment>
