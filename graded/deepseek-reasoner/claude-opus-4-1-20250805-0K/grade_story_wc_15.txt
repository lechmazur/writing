<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Calla's motivation is clear and intensifies through the story, rooted in her past as a poet and her current role as a weaver of new myths. Her internal conflict is shown through embodied actions ("fingers still moving in phantom stitches") and a credible, haunting optimism that feels earned. The final choice to embrace transformation over restoration is a decisive change motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the children begin to dance on the walls, reconfiguring the space from ruin to reverence with clear cost ("permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide"). The pattern of overlapping sleepwalking paths creates a coherent, taught structure that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful ("barnacles grew on petroglyphs," "canyon walls the color of dried blood and hope"). The environment is a crucible that shapes every action and the story's central concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The warming illustration plate and moving children represent a decisive intensification. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through her sewing, and the cost of her transformation is legible in the final, ephemeral image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image and action, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to build from ruin. The core concept of "broken precedents" is fully integrated into the thematic exploration of transformation versus restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The voice modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful compression and elision ("stitching new myths from the fragments of the drowned world") are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddy. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative pressure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. The final paragraph is a masterclass in rhythmic, image-driven closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A breathtakingly original synthesis of climate fiction, mythopoeia, and lyrical realism. The core premise of a tidal labyrinth and a sleepwalking weaver is highly specific and irreplaceable. The story commits fully to its own logic, and the final image feels both inevitable and astonishing. A clear, bold risk that pays off.</comment>
