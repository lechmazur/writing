<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is vivid with embodied interiority ("familiar weight of destiny settled on her shoulders like an old coat") and a clear, escalating motivation rooted in inherited legacy. Her final understanding feels earned through the dance's physical struggle, though the dice's autonomous action slightly diminishes her agency at a key moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong as pattern density increases through dance, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration ("Welcome home, granddaughter") with clear conceptual cost (inherited responsibility). The hangman's dice landing perfectly feels like a minor situational convenience in an otherwise rigorously patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choices through water, light, and decaying technology. The flooded laboratory charges the final image with the "perfect spiral" in water, and sensory details are purposefully filtered through Maya's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens as the dance's complexity increases system response, forcing a final, costly reversal. Agency is demonstrated through deliberate movement, and the cost of unlocking this transformative knowledge is legible in the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited knowledge and transforming limitation emerges organically from the dance and final revelation, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the spiral and the grandmother's message, deeply integrating concept and character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure. The prose possesses a strong rhythmic control suited to the accumulative mode. Elision is purposeful, and the final line successfully reweights prior material without explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduct for slight figurative density in phrases like "the universe responds with impossible geometries," which borders on thematic echo, though it remains character-bound and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dance and code-breaking is fresh and specific, executed with high conceptual integrity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived detail and a non-obvious emotional arc, making the ending feel inevitable and deeply original.</comment>
