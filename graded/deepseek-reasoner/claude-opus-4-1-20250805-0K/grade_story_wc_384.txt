<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mei Chen's internal conflict between duty and love is embodied through specific micro-choices, particularly the physical act of burning both forgeries. Her final authentic confession represents a credible, earned renunciation that forecloses her family's path with visible cost. The embodied emotion ("pearl of blood") and contradictory impulses feel character-particular, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: her discovery of the altar's message directly motivates the burning of the documents and writing of her confession. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost—she sacrifices her safety and legacy to free her brother and end the cycle. The key's function is taught and pays off cleanly at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary and aurora light are not merely decorative; they actively constrain and charge the final choice. The altar's surface reveals the crucial message when touched by the key, and the aurora's "jade shadows" modulate the tone. The rose thorn is a micro-setting object that draws blood and holds the final confession, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the causal lens: her decision to test the key leads to the discovery that forces the final, higher-stakes choice. The dominant stake (her brother's life and her moral integrity) tightens through this meaningful turn. The cost—the destruction of her forgeries and assumption of risk through confession—is legible and felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of Mei's choice, not statement. The grandmother's message—"The greatest treason is against one's own nature"—is earned and reweighted by Mei's action, answering the central question without moralizing. The final image of her "genuine signature" mattering more than her forgeries offers a resonant, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mei's perceptual signature—her calligrapher's precision and forger's eye color the descriptions. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the climactic burning sequence. The voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deduct for slight overwriting in the opening sentence ("breathed beneath the aurora's green dance") which slightly delays momentum. Otherwise, information density is high, sentences advance multiple elements, and no loops or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of "calibrated treason" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, lived detail of the forger's tools and the rose thorn's function elevates it beyond a template plot. The risk-taking in the quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure is fully committed to.</comment>
