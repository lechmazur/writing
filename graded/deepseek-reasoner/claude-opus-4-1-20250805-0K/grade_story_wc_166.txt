<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in defiance and artistry, compelling high-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is embodied in the dance, and her final transformation into a "living document of defiance" is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The emotional progression is credible, with loneliness transforming into purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira becomes eternal art, with cost legible in the authorities' impending arrival. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building through lyrical density to a cadence shift that reweights the stake. The final image of her dance seeding "future rebellions" charges the closure with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The twilight garden is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. The wisteria pulses with lunar rhythm, shadows pool like ink, and the environment evolves to hold her imprint. The moonstone dust, functioning as a key object, constrains and enables the ritual, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, with a single decisive intensification as the dance pulls starlight and weaves it into the garden. The cost is unmistakable: her impending capture by dawn charges the final image. The dominant stake of artistic defiance against tyranny tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between memory and tyranny, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: exile becomes expansion, isolation becomes incantation. The final image of the garden holding her imprint and seeding rebellions is a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that heightens the accumulative effect. Purposeful compression and elision ("gaps between heartbeats") are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shadows pooled like ink") is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A single instance of near-paraphrase ("exile into artistry, isolation into incantation") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics, political oppression, and memory as art feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "elective exile" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
