<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices (building monuments, prodding the speck) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation is earned through prior causality, with the final choice carrying visible cost in her altered state. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic label in "the euphoria of finally comprehending one's purpose," but it is immediately dramatized with moss growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira becomes a translator, reconfiguring the arbor's purpose. The cost is legible in her physical transformation and the mossy signature of joy. The lens holds consistently, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks (leaves falling upward, vein-letters) that reweight the dominant stake of choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice (seeds must be sorted, arbor creaks with satisfaction) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mira's expertise. The arbor itself functions as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and supplies resources (leaves as letters) that affect the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the moonstone prodding acting as a decisive intensification that reweights the stake. The cost is unmistakable in her transformation and the moss growth, foreclosing her old life. Pressure coheres through density increases (vein-letters, leaf-warnings) that narrow options toward the culminating choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (monuments, moss, ascending stories) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and choice, reweighting prior material. The integration of folklore and transformation feels inevitable, resisting tidy morals for complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with purposeful compression ("the hush where past meets prophecy"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's expertise. The prose's lyricism is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor artifice appears in "mossy delight" which risks therapy-speak, but it is immediately embodied and dramatized. There are no loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of skyborne arbor, seed-sorting, and lunar folklore feels fresh and non-obvious, transformed through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise commits fully to its implications, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
