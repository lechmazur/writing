<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her careful steps and wordless devotion rooted in her upbringing. Her final choice—to preserve the silence—is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable, foreclosing the path of reconciliation with a visible cost of eternal solitude. The tranquil perception inherited from her grandfather is a flaw that complicates her choice, making her endurance credible. A hairline slip: her realization about the covenant's nature ("twisted and tangled") edges toward diagnostic summary, but it is quickly grounded in the concrete discovery of the letters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Earned Stasis, with Mara's decision to endure as guardian carrying a heavy, felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered imagery and revelations (ghosts, box, documents, photos, letters) that deepen the thematic stake. The cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the "luminous weight." A minor deduction: the ghosts' appearance is a situational trigger, creating a slight hybrid feel early on before the accumulative mode solidifies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, pressuring every choice. The scorched wasteland and abandoned apiaries are not just backdrop but the central constraint, justifying Mara's isolation and her grandfather's futile devotion. The stained glass box functions as a micro-setting, its warmth and luminosity charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's expertise and loss, such as the hives like "broken teeth."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift—the discovery of the letters beneath the covenant. This deepens the central stake (the weight of unspoken words) and narrows Mara's options from potential action to certain endurance. The cost is unmistakable: her chosen path of "mute eloquence" is a profound and lonely renunciation. The pressure coheres perfectly from the ghosts' arrival to the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of communicative failure and the burden of silence emerges organically from the covenant, the ghosts' gestures, and the box's contents. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Mara carrying the "luminous weight," reweighting the premise without moralizing. The complexity is embraced; the silence is both a collective failure and an act of love, resisting a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perceptive, lonely consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a rhythmic control that heightens pressure, e.g., "heavy and luminous as honey in abandoned combs." Purposeful compression is used effectively, with elision (the specific reasons for the collective's dissolution) serving the theme of the unspoken. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and enriching atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors. There is zero evidence of loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. The final paragraph is a masterclass in rhythmic, conclusive prose that lands the closure image with devastating effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic decay, ecological grief, and a ghost story about communicative failure feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a "tangled covenant" is transformed from a legal MacGuffin into the story's emotional and thematic heart through specific, grounded detail. A minor cap exists as the quiet, stasis-based ending, while masterfully executed, is a known narrative mode, preventing a top-tier originality score.</comment>
