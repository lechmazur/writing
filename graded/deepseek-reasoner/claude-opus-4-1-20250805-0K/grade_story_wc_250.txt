<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's silent, embodied empathy is a profound and consistent trait that drives her every action. Thomas's internal conflict is rendered with specific, credible emotion, and his micro-choice to stay and watch is a clear reaction to her calm pressure. The final renunciation of his guilt is earned by the on-page demonstration, not told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; pressure builds through the density of the light/shutter patterns, culminating in Thomas's decisive internal change. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as he accepts a new understanding of his love, with cost felt in his tears and lighter walk. The final image of the canal carrying stars reinforces the conceptual repricing of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, puddles, and shutters are not just described but are active, essential tools that constrain and enable the central action of weaving light. The wet planks reflect stars, the shutters create patterns—the environment is the mechanism of the plot and thematically charges the final image of the water carrying secrets as light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, powerful deepening: the pattern of light and shadow intensifies to reweight Thomas's understanding of his dominant stake (unspoken love/guilt). The cost is the dissolution of the "stone" in his throat, a visceral price paid for the new knowledge. Agency is in his attention and acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme—that love is communicated in actions and silence can be profound empathy—is fully earned through the concrete, dramatized lesson with the mirror and shutters. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "darkness teaching us to treasure light" is deeply integrated and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's perceptive, silent consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") that modulates with the emotional intensity of the lesson. The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with a clear perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor artifact: the adverb "spiralingly" is a rare, slightly jarring lexical choice that feels slightly manufactured for effect, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, sentences are purposeful and propel the accumulative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent guardian using a dental mirror and shutters to teach about grief is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of silent empathy is executed with bold risk-taking that coheres perfectly, transforming a potential gimmick into a profound and organic narrative mechanism.</comment>
