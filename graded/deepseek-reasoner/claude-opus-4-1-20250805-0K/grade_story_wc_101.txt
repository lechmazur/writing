<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is deeply rooted in her gentle persistence and wisdom, with embodied micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of credit and the passing of her role to Samuel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tiredness. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic label in "gently persistent wisdom," but it is immediately anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through repeated midnight rituals to a resonant reconfiguration where the community becomes self-sustaining. Closure is a Charged Poise with Marta's tired but complete work, and cost is legible in "her work complete" and the final echo. The only hairline slip is the off-page resolution of sanctions, but it does not break the accumulative closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and antique silver bell function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marta's perception. The bell's echo in the final heartbeat image is a masterful use of object-as-setting to reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency under the accumulative lens, with the midnight exchanges tightening community bonds. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the foreclosed path of individual recognition. The sanctions provide coherent situational pressure that forces stance crystallization without resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the anonymous midnight exchanges, resisting moralizing. The final image of "a thousand quiet acts of midnight grace" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of dignity in community. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Marta's wisdom and age. The prose has rhythmic control, particularly in the description of the midnight rituals. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying significant subtext in the exchange with Samuel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Minor thesaurus-churn in "benevolent shadows" and a slight filter verb in "she understood" prevent a higher score, but these do not obscure closure. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of anonymous giving and community resilience feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world-building.</comment>
