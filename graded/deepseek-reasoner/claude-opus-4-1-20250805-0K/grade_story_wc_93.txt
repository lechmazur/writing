<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Yann's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique role, with micro-choices (placing stones, scattering dust) revealing her values. The final choice to create a new pattern for her apprentice is earned by her grandmother's revealed legacy. A slight abstraction in her initial desire to "understand" holds it back from the highest band, as the climactic revelation feels more granted than struggled for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern density increasing until the final conceptual repricing lands with immense cost and clarity. The closure is masterful: Yann's understanding of time's transparency and her new covenant with the eels reweights the entire premise. The orientation is immediate and the causal chain from ritual to revelation is airtight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The aurora, tidal bluff, and painted stones are not just vivid backdrop; they are the active mechanism of the plot. The collapsed star dust is a crucial object that constrains and enables the climax. The setting is fully integrated into action and charges the final image, with sensory detail ("living serpents of green light") that is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a flawless deepening of pattern and knowledge. The stake—understanding her purpose—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's completion, culminating in the vision that forces a stance crystallization. The cost is the burden of her new role as keeper of the covenant, felt in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: that loss (friction) can be a return to a truer state, and that knowledge is a cyclical covenant. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer through the image of Yann beginning the pattern for her own apprentice, reweighting the grandmother's promise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed dawn," "living serpents of green light"). The lyrical, slightly elevated register is perfectly motivated by the character and concept. Purposeful compression ("This borrowed dawn—neither true sunrise nor honest darkness—") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists in the peak beat ("beings of pure motion that had always existed in the spaces friction once obscured"), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure clarity. The closure image is crystal clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a physics-based concept (a frictionless world) with a mystical, cyclical vocation (eel herding) is breathtakingly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is wholly transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without ever sacrificing coherence.</comment>
