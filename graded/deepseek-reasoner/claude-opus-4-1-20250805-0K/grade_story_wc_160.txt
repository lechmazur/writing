<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in generational legacy, with embodied emotion ("began to tremble") and a micro-choice to leave the note. However, the final choice to conceal her role is slightly told ("She wouldn't claim credit") rather than fully dramatized with internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara leaves her "encrypted compassion" to be discovered, reconfiguring the community's options. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of credit and the felt weight of her "dappled resolve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amphitheater as a breathing entity is a masterful micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains choice, its rhythm mirroring Mara's resolve. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and woven into action, with the volcanic basin and chain providing tactile, lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens; her discovery of the mixed resin deepens her knowledge and leads to the high-stakes choice to design a covert solution. The cost of her anonymity is a visible, felt price that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the mixed resin and dual-operated floodgates. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to harmonizing conflict, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature ("star-drunk night"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., the withheld plan) are taught early and pay off at closure. Diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language ("stone lungs," "encrypted compassion") is pattern-taught and pays off. Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally with the scene's pressure, with zero loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of floodgate mechanics and conflict resolution is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "encrypted compassion" is a specific, non-obvious angle that heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
