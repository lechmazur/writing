<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory—her "cursed" honesty versus her father's deceit, her clinical precision in embalming contrasting with her emotional calculus. Her final micro-choice to "subtract his sins from her love" is earned by prior causality, with the cost of that reconciliation felt on the page. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic feel in the line "calculating what remained," but it is immediately grounded in the concrete final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Decisive Change under a Causal lens: Wei's acceptance of the offerings and Maya's final reconciliation are directly caused by her revelations and his inherited rage. The cost is legible in Wei's "trembling hands" and Maya's solitary subtraction. The structure is taut, with every beat linking because/therefore, from the breach to the final exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prep room is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("chemical-sweet air," "fluorescent brightness") and functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image of transformation. However, it does not fully constrain choice; the scene could plausibly occur elsewhere with minor adjustments, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Maya's controlled revelations systematically dismantle Wei's rigid anger, forcing a reconfiguration of his goal from theft to acceptance. The cost is unmistakable in the liquefaction of his rage and the weight of the truth he must now carry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of moral accounting emerges organically from the father's "mathematics of a con" being repurposed for atonement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "everything" that remains is love purified by honest reckoning, a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("deathly vitality," "liquid mercury"). The dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The prose rhythm is controlled, modulating with emotional intensity without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor flaw exists: slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "liquefying into confusion") creates a hint of register drift, but it does not obscure clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a funeral home, a stolen ink pot, and a con artist's legacy feels fresh and inevitable. The central conceit—using ashes for apology letters—is a bold, specific risk that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the theme, transforming a familiar premise into a singular vision.</comment>
