<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is vivid and specific, with Elara's "combative tenderness" and Kess's "sharp-edged grief" creating a dynamic, pressure-cooked relationship. Micro-choices, like Kess leaning in "despite herself," reveal layered internal conflict. The final choice to annotate is earned by prior causality, though the mentor's motivation could be slightly more conflicted on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kess understands the lesson is for her future self, reconfiguring the stakes with palpable cost. A hybrid (causal/accumulative) drive lens holds: causal linkages (shadow→leaves→ledger) combine with textural density (swing image) to charge the final image. The ending lands with felt cost in Kess's aged eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library is atmospherically rich but functions more as a moody container than a constraint; the true "micro-settings" are the shadow-glass and tea cup, which brilliantly constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the hybrid lens: Kess's shift from skepticism to engagement narrows options and deepens knowledge. The dominant stake (saving her mother) tightens meaningfully into a higher stake (saving herself), with cost legible in her emotional crumble and aged gaze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—tea leaves, annotations, a backward walk—eschewing moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer: "resilience isn't given, it's grown." The final image of the stilled swing and beginning something new reweights the premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, slightly poetic narrative voice that modulates under pressure ("rust on iron"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. Minor rhythmic unevenness in a few sentences prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and vivid with high information density. A few minor artifacts exist, like the slightly over-written "suspended moment between day and memory," but they do not obscure causality or dull the closure. Sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror shards, exile, and divination via tea leaves feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus, avoiding template plotting.</comment>
