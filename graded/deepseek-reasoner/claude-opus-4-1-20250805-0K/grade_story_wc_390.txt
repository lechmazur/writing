<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "larynx adjust[ing] microscopically" and her body becoming a "tuning fork." Her motivation to protect the covenant is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the ultimate sacrifice. The final choice to become sound is earned by prior causality and carries the immense, visible cost of her physical form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens is taught early and holds, building pressure through sensory and symbolic density. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira becomes the lighthouse's voice, with cost made legible in the image of her empty coat and her eternal, shimmering presence in the beam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring the protagonist and charging the closure. The drift-ice marina's groaning platforms and fracturing ice barriers create immediate danger, while the lighthouse itself—its metal door, spiral stairs, and vault—constrains Mira's choices and becomes the vessel for her final, transformative act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification driven by Mira's agency. The Collectors' arrival provides coherent external pressure, forcing the climax. The cost of her choice is unmistakably rendered on the page through the loss of her physical form, making the stake viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of character, setting, and concept. The central idea of "becoming sound itself" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of sacrifice and guardianship, reweighting all prior material without moralizing. The final image of the song echoing "as long as the ice remembered" offers profound, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional, sensory-specific perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity ("vibrations travel through her skull like whispered prayers"). Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the voice remains coherent and compelling under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats ("became what the artifact needed—not its keeper but its voice") which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (lighthouse keeper, sacred artifact) into a wholly original, breathtakingly specific concept. The fusion of sonic science, ecological covenant, and personal sacrifice feels inevitable and fresh. The risk of a protagonist dissolving into pure energy is committed to fully and pays off with immense conceptual integrity.</comment>
