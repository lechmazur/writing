<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is clear, rooted in concrete memories and a tangible purpose. Her interiority is specific and embodied ("thistled calm"). A minor deduction for the backstory block, which, while well-integrated, slightly summarizes her purpose rather than showing it solely through present-moment micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal, with clear because/therefore linkages: the broadcast compels her to transcribe, which leads to the plan for the gala. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she steps into the mist, the cost of her risk and the potential of her action felt. The orientation is immediate and the structure is taut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ember alcove and radio dial glow are not just atmospheric; they are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable her work, providing the heat and light necessary for her rebellion. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her POV, with the dust itself becoming a central, active element of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring imagination) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency: the pirate broadcast directly instructs her, raising the stakes and narrowing her options to a single, high-risk course of action. The cost of her all-night vigil and the potential consequence of discovery are legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion through art emerges organically from the core concept. The final image of her carrying "luminous burden" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. Subtext is rich, particularly in the dual meaning of the musical notation and the dust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the tension of the scene. The voice is confident and consistent, with a perceptual signature that notices the world in a way specific to her role and mission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and vivid ("thistled calm," "luminous burden"). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, anchoring and resolving the piece with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of using musical notation and dust as vehicles for forbidden narratives is highly original and ingeniously executed. The synthesis of dystopian control, artistic rebellion, and almost-magical realism feels fresh, inevitable, and fully committed to its own internal logic.</comment>
