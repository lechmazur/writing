<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's characterization is precise and contradictory: her devotion to truth battles her loyalty to legacy, culminating in a micro-choice to deceive that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of honesty is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the vault-locking gesture. Embodied emotion ("hand trembled") and professional competence balance flawlessly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: the journalist's call incites a logical investigation using proof-by-contradiction, leading to the comet-tail revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she chooses misdirection, with cost legible in "a goodbye kiss to honesty." The orbit metaphor shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its instruments "mock human truth," the dome's acoustics amplify her laugh, and the vault physically seals her decision. The rosewood nib charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("clouds below beginning to glow like old newsprint").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: each deductive step narrows options until the Geneva/Geneva contradiction forces the remote-meeting revelation. The stakes (empire protection vs. truth) tighten meaningfully, and the cost of chosen misdirection is felt in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orbit metaphor and observatory setting, exploring how truth can be deliberately kept elliptical. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "regrets meant to circle forever." No moralizing; complexity embraces both ethical ambiguity and emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that mirrors Margot's journalistic precision. Diction remains within her lexicon ("orbits of regret," "conceptual repricing"). The intercom dialogue is brief but functional. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during deductions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor flaw: slight figurative density in "orbits of regret, she thought, watching the loops form and reform" borders on self-consciousness but doesn't obscure clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of newsprint empire, astronomical observation, and logical proof feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "orbits of regret" transforms familiar tropes of legacy and secrecy. Risk-taking in the quiet, intellectual climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
