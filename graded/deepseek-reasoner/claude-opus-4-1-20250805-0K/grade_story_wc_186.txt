<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong, with her retrocognitive gift and stubborn endurance clearly motivating her pivotal choice. Her final act feels earned, though a touch more internal contradiction during the climb could have elevated the score further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in inevitability, with the inciting incident (shard's fall) and climax (beacon's rekindling) linked through a clear, accumulative lens. The closure is a decisive change with a profound, felt cost—the reconfiguration of hope itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is not just a setting but a crucible; its harmonics and the beacon's mechanics directly constrain Mira's actions and charge the final, triumphant image of anti-light illuminating the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are crystal clear from the outset: the hope of calling the lost home. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in combining the prism and shard, a meaningful tightening that forces a final, costly, and successful action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme—that coincidences are conspiracies of light—is woven perfectly through the narrative, emerging from the specific events without a hint of moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. The prose is consistently lyrical and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping or register drift to break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is exquisite and highly evocative, though a slight risk of overwriting exists in the peak beat ("shadows that fell upward"). However, the rhythm is masterfully controlled, and every sentence advances the story with purpose and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "shard of hush" and a retrocognitive custodian is brilliantly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with a high degree of specificity and authentic vision.</comment>
