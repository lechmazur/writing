<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion ("guilt had worked into his bones"). His final renunciation of obsessive chronicling is earned by the graffiti's revelation, with visible cost in abandoning his life's work. The daringly methodical trait complicates choices, making his failure at the bridge inevitable and his endurance credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of maps and water imagery intensifies to a cadence shift at the graffiti revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marcus reconfigures his purpose, with cost felt in abandoning his notebooks. Orientation is immediate; causality remains tight through symbolic linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the ivy-clad station mirrors decay and renewal, constraining choice by housing the pivotal graffiti. The bellows object charges the final image ("taped patches catching the light like scales"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's professional bias toward erosion and sediment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Stakes (self-forgiveness) escalate through accumulative density of map motifs, culminating in the graffiti's wisdom forcing a stance crystallization. Marcus's agency in drawing his own map is a decisive tightening that forecloses his old path. Cost is legible in abandoning his chronicles for a new beginning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through river imagery and graffiti aphorisms, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forgiveness flows like a river, not a lake. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of scientific rigor ("pH readings") and emotional truth ("the river knows").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the world had edges again—sharp ones that cut"). Syntax reflects Marcus's methodical mind, yet modulates under emotional pressure. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Minor flaw: the metaphor "dust wheezed out like a confession" slightly strains coherence. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances character or atmosphere with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological documentation and psychological grief feels inevitable. The conceit of river chronicling as a metaphor for guilt is fresh and fully committed. Risk-taking in using graffiti as the catalyst pays off without gimmickry, transforming a familiar trope through grounded specificity.</comment>
