<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's abrasive calm and rational rebellion are consistently embodied through micro-choices, like handling the cog. The woman's reveal shifts his stance credibly, and their final partnership is earned by prior causality with visible cost to his solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds; closure is a decisive change (descending together) with cost to Marcus's isolation. The woman's arrival incites a because/therefore escalation through dialogue, tightening options toward collaboration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken city constrains choices (sewer entry, submerged statues) and charges the final image. Sensory details like "barnacles creep across marble statues" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from debate to collaboration under causal pressure; Marcus's agency (confrontation) and the woman's reveal force a trade-off. Cost is legible in Marcus's cracked composure and forfeited solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of competing narratives emerges through action (cog analysis, journal reveal) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth, like sediment, needs time to settle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct ("abrasive calm"). Dialogue carries subtext and goals; the woman's lines shift from official to personal register intentionally. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with zero artifacts. Figurative language ("plague had receded like a tide") is purposeful. Sentences advance character and atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken city and historical revisionism; the twist (woman's true mission) transforms tropes. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
