<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Martha's characterization is deeply embodied through specific micro-choices (palm on glass, retracing cuts) and a credible internal contradiction between her fierce meditation and the vulnerability of hearing a ghost. Her final choice to read the poem aloud is earned by decades of carving and the spectral mentorship, with visible cost in her solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through the density of losses (Nguyens, Johnsons) and the migrating monarchs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the families touch the stone. The final cost is legible in the fading voice and the solitary reading, reconfiguring grief into connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is indispensable, constraining choice by housing both the milkweed and the workbench, and charging the final image as it "held the words like cupped hands." Sensory details are filtered through Martha's professional bias (iron bones, cool glass) and evolve with the dying light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the dual clocks of the migration and the spectral grandfather's urgency, narrowing Martha's options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in her accelerated work and the grandfather's fading presence, culminating in the families' tactile connection to the stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the braiding of losses into the granite ribbon, avoiding direct statement. The final image of the poem carried south with the butterflies offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to stone and flight. The grandfather's dialogue carries a "thundering calm" idiom separate from Martha's internal voice. Purposeful elision (how she collected poems) imposes cost and is paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that accelerate with urgency. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught ("grief has grain") and pays off. One minor strain: "thundering calm" risks abstraction but is immediately anchored by "distant storms."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is fresh and inevitable. The ribbon motif transforms from family heirloom to collective border, avoiding tropes through grounded specificity. Risk-taking in the ghost voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
