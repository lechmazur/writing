<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her final, high-stakes choice. Her internal conflict is shown through the fracturing of her consciousness across timelines, though her emotional state in the climax is occasionally articulated with near-diagnostic clarity ("conquering the labyrinth of self meant choosing"), which slightly dulls the embodied immediacy of her struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density and pattern breaks. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with undeniable cost: "choosing... which ones to let die" and the final image of "walk[ing] forward on solid ground" reconfigures the premise with a felt price paid for wholeness. The pattern of fractal timelines is taught early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct and tablet are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the action, filtering perception through Kira's urgency. The viaduct's procedural generation directly pressures her choices. It narrowly misses the 9-band gate as the environment, while atmospheric, does not concretely constrain a specific tactical choice; its reformation is more a reflection of internal state than an external constraint she must navigate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is superb, achieved through a density increase of fractal Kiras and a cadence shift into the procedural generation stutter. The dominant stake (integration vs. fragmentation) is relentlessly tightened, forcing the protagonist's decisive, costly action to press the final rune. Agency and cost are legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of integrated selfhood emerges entirely from the core concept and specific events, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: wholeness is found not in floating above life but in "truly living it" on the ground, a conceptual repricing earned by the entire narrative's pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice possesses a distinct, controlled perceptual signature, especially in the opening beat describing the "drop and the ripple." The purposeful compression of experiencing "every version of herself simultaneously" is taught and paid off. The older Kira's dialogue is tonally consistent and serves as a crucial turning point.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor template cadence emerges in one paragraph ("The soldier's courage, the mother's love..."), creating a slight list-like effect in an otherwise propulsive climax. This artifact is minor and does not touch the closure, but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravity-defier, a quantum artifact, and a procedurally-generated psychological labyrinth is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally truthful conclusion, transforming familiar tropes of choice and identity into a singular, ingenious vision.</comment>
