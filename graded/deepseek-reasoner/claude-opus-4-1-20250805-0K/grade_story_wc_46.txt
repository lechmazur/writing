<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is concrete and particular, with micro-choices (polishing the glass, holding it up) revealing her values and competence. Her motivation is clear and rooted in grief and duty, intensifying to compel the high-stakes choice to share the light. The final renunciation of solitary lighthouse keeping for communal teaching is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her grandfather's legacy felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory density and memory resurfacing to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on the page with clear cost: the lighthouse is permanently replaced, and Marina's role is reconfigured. The lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of the failed lighthouse shapes all tactics. The linkage from memory to discovery to sharing is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is indispensable, functioning as both setting and crucial tool that constrains choice and charges the final image. Its misty, amplifying properties are necessary for the light's effect. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, reflecting Marina's professional priorities. The environment is a lived-in, tactile space that directly enables the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from personal search to communal discovery. The dominant stake (guiding ships) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the discovery of the sea glass's power. The cost is legible on the page: the relinquishment of the old lighthouse system and the assumption of a new, teaching role. Pressure coheres and deepens through a single, decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—finding light in unexpected places, guidance through patience rather than power. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of shared, soft light, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the grandfather's cryptic words and the polished sea glass. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through its specific, earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in the lyrical, professional prose. The narrative voice is consistent and effectively modulated, with diction that remains within Marina's plausible lexicon. The brief dialogue with Tomás is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext. Purposeful elision (the exact polishing technique) is taught and pays off, maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor register drift occurs with the phrase "zephyr bloom of dawn," which feels slightly ornamental and outside the POV's established lexicon, though it does not harm closure. Otherwise, sentences are clear, concise, and propel the narrative forward without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar elements (lighthouse keeper, sea glass) through specific grounded choices in character and world. The core concept of an "earthbound star watcher" feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of a common trope through lived detail and a unique moral calculus is exceptional.</comment>
