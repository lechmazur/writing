<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her "brightly attentive" trait is embodied in her actions, not just stated. The connection to her father provides emotional weight, though his specific link to the pattern feels slightly convenient rather than fully dramatized. Her final choice is earned, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. The investigation proceeds with clear because/therefore linkages, culminating in a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands on the page with cost ("her profile beginning its transformation"). The Apollo-X connection is the one minor slip, feeling more thematic than causally integrated into the plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is masterfully rendered, a character in itself that constrains and enables Lila's choices. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional POV. The mission patch and servers are not just described but actively charge the final image and Lila's ultimate choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the causal lens, each discovery narrowing her options and raising the stakes. The cost is legible and profound: the forfeiture of her physical existence to join the archived. The dominant stake (finding the truth) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of digital absence/presence is fully integrated, emerging from the core concept and Lila's specific journey. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The reweighting of "deletion" into "going home" is exceptional thematic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that fits the character. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that supports the thematic weight. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly efficient and vivid, with excellent information density. A few minor clichés ("digital ghosts," "breadcrumbs") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the final paragraphs prevent a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are never lost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate mystery, digital archaeology, and cosmic horror (of a sort) is fresh and specific. The core concept of a shadow archive for consciousness is ingeniously explored. The story commits fully to its premise, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
