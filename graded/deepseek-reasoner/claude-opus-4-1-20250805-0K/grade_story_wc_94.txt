<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes creative resistance. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The "furiously tranquil" state embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final choice to continue the vigil is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost—Maya's continued vigil reconfigures the meaning of silence. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting the dominant stake. The lightning strike complicates but doesn't resolve, maintaining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choices and charges the final image, functioning as both setting and crucible. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional priorities. The dome's rotation and storm's electricity are integrated into action and theme. Micro-setting elements (timer, chemicals) actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the storm and timer creating coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in Maya's continued isolation and risk. The dominant stake (artistic resistance) tightens meaningfully through her rarefaction process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</comment><grade>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to censorship through the final image of scars becoming stars. Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the constellation of censorship marks. Subtext operates powerfully in implication, with the "weather log" conceit carrying revolutionary meaning. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with excellent rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable and apt, with Maya's astronomer-poet voice consistently filtering perception. Purposeful compression (e.g., "rarefied language") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional prose with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, though slight density in peak beats ("electric kiss lingered in the air") prevents perfect score. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of astronomy and censorship themes feels inevitable in hindsight. The "rarefaction" concept transforms familiar material through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template plots or derivative premises.</comment>
