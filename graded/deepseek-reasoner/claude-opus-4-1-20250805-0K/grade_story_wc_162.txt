<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices like tracing the railing grain and using the logbook's codes. Her emotional progression from determined search to understanding her father's choice feels earned, with embodied interiority ("felt it—the threshold") avoiding diagnostic speak. The final choice to document her own codes shows a credible endurance that forecloses simple reunion with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly: patterns (grain, weather codes, distances) intensify toward the threshold discovery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina accepts her father's state while committing to her own path. Cost is legible in her kneeling and the permanent three-degree temperature differential. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The corn maze and terrace are indispensable constraints that charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (whispering corn, spiral soil, rainbow shadows). The environment actively shapes choices—the railing's grain pattern directly informs navigation. Micro-setting (logbook, soil temperature) achieves high specificity without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the accumulative lens: her decoding of weather patterns and spatial relationships tightens options toward the center. The dominant stake (discovering her father's fate) deepens through her use of the logbook and environmental clues. Cost is felt in the threshold's permanent differential and her decision to document rather than follow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of distance, loss, and sacred geometry. The final image reweights "necessary distances" as both physical and emotional spans we cross. Subtext operates powerfully in the corn's whisper and her response. Avoids moralizing; the ending's resonance arises from concrete particulars like the seven-foot rows matching her father's arm span.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends scientific observation ("pressure differential") with lyrical insight ("fractured hush"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, and the patterned elision (e.g., weather codes) is taught early and pays off. No dialogue, but internal voice carries subtext and goal-driven action throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("featherly determined") is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor repetition in "fractured hush" appears twice but serves pattern reinforcement. No scaffolding or loops; closure image lands with clarity and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weather science, sacred geometry, and emotional loss feels fresh and inevitable. The corn maze as weather map is a non-obvious concept that transforms the familiar. Risk-taking in layered imagery pays off without gimmickry. Specificity in details like the 21-foot sound distance anchors the universal theme.</comment>
