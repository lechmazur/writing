<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her archival ethics, with interiority concrete and character-particular. Her internal conflict between truth and mercy is dramatized in the codicil addition, a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. The final endurance of "haunted euphoria" is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speech, though the euphoria label leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Mara's discovery of the fire's cause escalates stakes, leading to the codicil addition as a decisive change. Closure lands on-page with cost ("haunted euphoria," locket as "burden"). Orientation is immediate; who, where, and when anchor by line 2. Persistent constraint of archival duty shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the jetty and wisteria pressure Mara's decision and charge the final image ("both women stood in its sweetness"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (walnut-ink stains, wisteria perfume). Spatial choreography is coherent, with objects like the locket and satchel integrated into action. Professional detail (archival inks) serves character choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: discovery of the fire's cause tightens options, forcing the codicil choice. Cost is legible in "haunted euphoria" and the locket as "burden." Dominant stake (truth vs. mercy) is signaled early and deepens through Mara's research. No coincidence; resolution earned through alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (codicil, locket, jetty) without direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "covenants regenerate through remembering." Subtext operates in implication (Eleanor's "thank you" carrying grace despite truth). Resists tidy morals; embraces complexity of mercy and historical reckoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "steep through her lungs like rare teas"). Diction remains within Mara's lexicon; no head-hopping. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Eleanor's brief lines). Purposeful compression in reflective blocks anchors in present cues and alters options.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("haunted and luminous as the twilight itself"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and character; syntax varies purposefully. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural rhythm. Minor abstraction in "euphoria" is offset by concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh angle on ethical archival work, transformed through specific choices (codicil). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, moral complexity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template plots; emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Authenticity of vision in voice and subject.</comment>
