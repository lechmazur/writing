<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is masterfully rendered through embodied micro-choices and contradictory impulses. Her decision to extend the drawer pull rather than seek vengeance reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Thorne’s relief and apology are equally specific, avoiding stock reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Charged Poise where shared blindness reconfigures stakes. The drawer pull and moon phases accumulate meaning, tightening the moral calculus. Cost is legible in the final image of equal darkness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The parapet and mist function as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (e.g., "mist coiled," "windblown stones") and reflect POV urgency. The drawer pull evolves from artifact to moral compass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under the Accumulative lens: her revelation about the drawer pull’s history deepens stakes and forces Thorne’s apology. The cost of forgoing vengeance is felt in the "furrowed hush" and reconfigured power dynamic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the drawer pull and moon phases, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to recycling sorrow into wisdom. Subtext operates in gestures (extending the object) and silences, resisting moralizing. The final image reweights prior grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("storm-worn parapet," "furrowed hush"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I accept your apology as down payment"). Elision (e.g., the brother’s death) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor deduction for "furrowed hush" repeated twice, creating a slight template cadence. Figurative language ("anchored her," "scar between two wounds") is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prisoner exchange with moon phases and a recurring object. The drawer pull is irreplaceable, transforming a generic trope through grounded specificity. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
