<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices; her "warmly inquisitive" trait is embodied in her handling of the goggles and decision to decode. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to preserve joy feels earned by prior causality, though a slight tell in the thematic resolution prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; each floor ascent adds a new layer of discovery, tightening the narrative toward the resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the final image of Mira understanding her purpose. The diary's revelation transforms prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (elevator ascent, cold) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional familiarity. The goggles and elevator are tactile objects that evolve with the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens; each discovery narrows options and deepens stakes. Cost is felt in her altered perspective, though the external pressure remains static. One meaningful tightening (coordinates projection) suffices for this length, but lacks a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (goggles, diary, ascent) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to sorrow's transformation. However, the final paragraph's "Sorrow shared becomes joy discovered" leans slightly toward moralizing, though it's anchored in character experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical observation ("brass fixtures") with emotional nuance ("suspended grief"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity; purposeful elision (e.g., elevator floors as beats) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones") serves pressure and clarity. Information density is high—e.g., elevator floors advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (grief, discovery, isolation) through specific voice and setting. The elevator-as-structural-device and goggles-as-tool are irreplaceable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Originality lies in emotional specificity and transformative closure.</comment>
