<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is deeply rooted in specific, embodied guilt and a contradictory desire for redemption versus discovery. Her final choice to transmit both coordinates is a complex micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values, earned by her three months of desperate searching. The pen is a tactile anchor that constrains and charges her final stance. A slight deduction for the "confidently uncertain" label, which feels more diagnostic than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens holds: her mistake forces her search, which reveals the anomaly's nature, which presents the final choice. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise; her transmission of both coordinates crystallizes the story's core paradox with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate and clear, and the anomaly's rule-set is taught effectively through specific, dramatized examples (her seeing the fleet, Davis seeing his daughter).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not just backdrop; it actively pressures choices and supplies the core conflict. The observation chamber and the pen are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "bent starlight into impossible spirals"). The setting's rules are consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (redeem her mistake vs. preserve a monumental discovery) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens. The approaching rescue vessel creates a live, on-page tightening that forces her final, costly choice. The cost is legible and felt: accepting the edited history would mean losing the hard-won understanding of the anomaly's true nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in error emerges organically from the core concept and Mira's specific struggle, culminating in the beautiful, non-literal final line: "sometimes the wrong seeds grow the most unexpected gardens." The piece embraces complexity and meaningful ambiguity without moralizing. The grandfather's theories and the pen serve as concrete particulars that ground the thematic exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's perceptual signature, with a distinct, controlled voice that modulates under pressure. The prose is confident and purposefully compressed. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the final paragraph's thematic summation, though it remains largely within the character's plausible idiom and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("constellations of data," "wrong seeds grow the most unexpected gardens"). There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a reality-editing anomaly is brilliantly fresh and executed with full commitment to its implications. The synthesis of hard sci-fi (gravitational lensing) with profound human emotion (guilt, memory) feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The resolution avoids the safety of a tidy choice, instead crystallizing in a bold, ambiguous, and thematically rich Charged Poise.</comment>
