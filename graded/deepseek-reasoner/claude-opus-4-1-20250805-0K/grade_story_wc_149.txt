<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlow’s characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his mournful elation and micro-choices under pressure revealing a complex hierarchy of values. The ghost bride is a fully realized secondary character whose "lovingly venomous" nature forces choices that alter their relationship state by the end. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with the cost of liberation felt in his weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (dawn breaks, garden becomes ordinary) with undeniable cost (the broken bead, his tears). A strong Causal/Hybrid lens holds: her early arrival ("You're early") directly triggers the resonant awakening and the final repayment of the debt. The orientation is immediate and the structure is taut, with every beat linking because/therefore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is not just vivid description; it is the engine of the plot and directly constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image of its transformation. Sensory details are purposefully selected and filtered through Marlow's professional POV, with the garden's rules remaining perfectly consistent and integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freedom from the curse) is signaled early and escalates under the Causal lens through the ghost bride's arrival and the bead's activation. A single, meaningful tightening occurs as she reaches for the bead, foreclosing the option of the status quo. The cost of this escalation—the dissolution of the garden and the ghost—is profoundly legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of liberation from a beautiful, poisonous bond emerges entirely from the specific events and images, culminating in the final, non-literal image of the sunrise and thawing fields. The story offers a resonant answer to its central question without moralizing, achieved through the concrete cost of the garden's transformation and the ghost's dissipation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, rhythmic cadence that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marlow's perception, with the ghost bride's dialogue carrying a distinct, crystalline frost idiom that contrasts with his internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and zero prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("crystalline frost," "venomous affection") is precise, purposeful, and consistent, enhancing clarity and momentum rather than obscuring it. The syntax and rhythm are masterfully controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gothic romance, alchemy, and a ghost story feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed through to a transformative, inevitable conclusion. The specific choice to make the debt one of release, not payment, is a non-obvious and ingenious inflection that heightens the stakes.</comment>
