<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, with clear motivation rooted in grief and love. Her internal conflict is embodied through concrete actions like trembling fingers and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to release Thomas from his guilt feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her three-year vigil. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on poetic abstraction in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully with Thomas's solidification, a Decisive Change under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image of two shadows dancing. The lens holds consistently through sensory accumulation. The only minor issue is the late introduction of the accident backstory, which slightly strains causality but doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse functions as both setting and crucible, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities. The lighthouse's physicality pressures the action throughout, particularly in the climactic lamp room scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the jasmine scent intensifying across beats. The dominant stake (reclaiming Thomas) tightens meaningfully through her purification of intentions. Cost is visible in her three-year isolation and the final imperfect reunion. Minor deduction for the accident revelation arriving via summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central concept of purified intention, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about love transcending dimensions without stating a thesis. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the falling cork. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature in Mara's professional observation filtered through grief. The voice modulates effectively under pressure, though there's slight register drift in phrases like "screaming tenderness." Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor artifacts include slightly overwrought phrasing ("screaming tenderness") and a template cadence in "real enough to hold, real enough to love." These don't obscure closure but slightly dull peak beats. Figurative language is mostly coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh synthesis of supernatural and emotional elements, with the concept of "vibrations of intent" feeling both original and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of grief into tangible action is specific and memorable.</comment>
