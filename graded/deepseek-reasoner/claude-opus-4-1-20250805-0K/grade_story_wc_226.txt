<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait of defiance, compelling her high-stakes choice to weaponize the canyon's echoes. Her backstory is economically integrated and tilts her present stance. However, internal contradiction is more summarized than simultaneously acted upon in scene, and the final endurance is more declarative than felt through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres and escalates through the layering of voices, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the canyon's purpose is irrevocably transformed. The closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost: "the forged hush... broke apart like ice in spring." Orientation is immediate, and the lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The towers of bone and the canyon's acoustics are not merely described; they are the central mechanism of the plot, actively constraining and enabling Kira's choice. The setting charges the final image, as the spire becomes a "transmitter of possibilities." Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—Kira's initial whisper—which triggers a deepening cascade of voices that reweights the dominant stake of truth control. The cost is legible in the Silencers' impending arrival and the shattered artificial quiet, narrowing their options irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of truth's multiplicity emerges organically from the central action of refraction, resisting a tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Truth, like light through water, would always find a way to bend." This conceptual repricing is earned through the specific event and avoids final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the rising intensity of the chorus. The voice is confident and the perceptual signature is strong. A minor deduction for the slightly contrived phrase "forged hush," which feels more authorial than character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A single, minor artifact is noted: the phrase "forged hush" risks being a near-oxymoron that slightly calls attention to itself, but it does not harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of an acoustic rebellion against thought control is strikingly original and fully committed to. The combination of ossuary prison, echo refraction, and impromptu poetry feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing familiar ideas into a fresh, singular vision.</comment>
