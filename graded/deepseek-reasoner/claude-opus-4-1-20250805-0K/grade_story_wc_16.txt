<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena's characterization is strong, with clear motivation and embodied emotion ("hands trembled with cautious exuberance"). Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though a minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic "carefully reckless" label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost under a Causal lens. The inkwell's glow provides a tangible, felt cost of the reactivated truth, and the linkage from discovery to action is tight and motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive and inkwell are vividly rendered and functionally constrain choice. The inkwell's evolution from decorative object to active participant charges the final image, though it narrowly misses the 9-band gate as the setting itself doesn't directly pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the Causal lens, with a clear, meaningful tightening as the inkwell glows, confirming her path. The cost of potential failure is legible, though the external summit deadline remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of linguistic harmony is masterfully integrated, emerging from the concrete particulars of the translation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the entire premise through the "symphonies of truth" concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, and the elision of the summit itself is a purposeful, taught compression that serves the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "truth could still symphony," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise of a language that binds reality is fresh and executed with high conceptual integrity. The synthesis of linguistic and political conflict feels organic and inevitable, with specific, grounded choices throughout.</comment>
