<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in her inherited role and empathy for trapped creatures. Her final choice to complete the drawings is a decisive, earned renunciation with visible cost (the cracked pendant). However, her internal contradiction under peak stress is more summarized than dramatized in the chamber scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (freeing the creatures) with clear conceptual cost (the city's borrowed time evaporates). The causal lens holds firmly: the pendant's hum incites action, her investigation discovers the source, and her drawings directly cause the resolution. The time constraint of the giant's nap effectively tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system and Morteus's integrated form are vividly specific and purposefully constrain choice, charging the final image of water flowing clear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's professional POV ("temporal residue," "breathing chambers"). The chamber of suspended moments is the story's conceptual and thematic core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the causal lens: she actively seeks the source, dives through the gap, and makes the pivotal choice to draw. The dominant stake (freeing trapped creatures) is clear, and the cost is legible in the sculptors' panic and the cracked pendant. The giant's impending stir adds coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from event and image: the moral cost of "borrowed time" and the necessity of honoring endings. The final image of drawing "living creatures, present and real" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, illustration-focused narrative voice ("unfinished moth wing," "temporal residue"). The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that supports the mystical atmosphere. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery. Information density is high; sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. A minor instance of potentially ornate language ("creatures that existed only in the margins of time") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-sculpting, ecological grief, and a giant integrated into city architecture is highly original and feels organic. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
