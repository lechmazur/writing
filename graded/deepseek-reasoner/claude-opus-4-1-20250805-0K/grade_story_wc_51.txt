<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("seventeen grams of oxidized brass that grew heavier each time she touched it"). Her final choice—to hold the weight of weightlessness—is earned by prior causality, a credible endurance with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously: she is "boundary-lessly trapped and absolutely free."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: the final image of her father cleaning burners reconfigures the premise. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through density increases ("the shingled hush grew deeper"). A persistent constraint (the grotto's walls) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is indispensable, constraining choice by containing her fractals and supplying the starlight alignment mechanism. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("snowmelt trickled through its ancient seams"). The kerosene lamp functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and constraining action through its weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Mara actively orients to the starlight, deepening the weave and accumulating weights. Cost is legible in the lamp's warming and the final crystallization. The dominant stake (collecting burdens) tightens through a cadence shift into the whalebone reverie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of imprisonment and freedom through the final paradox. Theme emerges organically from concrete images (lamp, fractals, bronze) without moralizing. The final conceptual repricing ("some prisons we weave ourselves") reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation under pressure ("the shingled hush of overlapping dimensions"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's specialized perception. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the father backstory) are taught early and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density with clear propulsion; most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("vast and curved, containing spaces that breathed with prehistoric patience") but remains coherent and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singular synthesis of mathematical concept and emotional weight feels inevitable. The core premise (fractal weaving as burden-collecting) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. High irreplaceability.</comment>
