<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira’s characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her calloused fingers and "boldly sympathetic certainty" driving the plot. Her final choice to find the artist is a high-stakes decision rooted in her established traits. Old Tomás applies secondary pressure but his motivation is slightly less dimensional than Kira's, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly, building pressure through the ritual of the search. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the completed arbor acts as a mirror, reconfiguring the community's understanding of itself with a clear, felt cost of belonging finally found.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and glimmering obsidian arbor are not just vivid but actively constrain and charge the narrative. The arbor's transformation is the story's central action, and the crater's geography directly shapes the final search. Sensory detail is masterfully woven into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes of belonging and artistic purpose are signaled early and escalate cleanly through the accumulative lens. The search ritual represents a meaningful deepening that narrows options, culminating in the communal descent. The cost of the artist's self-exile and the effort of the search are legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaving of reeds and stories into the arbor, a potent metaphor for the "webs of kinship." The final image of the arbor as a "mirror" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of belonging and artistic legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Kira's perception, creating a distinct, lyrical voice. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists in the first paragraph ("trembled with morning light, each translucent fruit catching fire"), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure causality or the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and forgotten languages feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "webs of kinship" is transformed from an abstraction into the story's literal structure and action, representing a significant and specific risk that pays off.</comment>
