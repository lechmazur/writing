<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The seer's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her blindness and tactile navigation revealing her history. Her internal conflict between prophecy and her lost self is dramatized through concrete sensations like "the particular ache of kneeling in fresh-turned earth." The final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoning her prophetic identity. Minor deduction for the scholar's functional but brief appearance lacking deeper pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—she forecloses her prophetic path to recover her gardening self. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (mercury to soil) reweighting the stake. The stone's guidance feels slightly elliptical but pays off at closure. Cost is legible in "the soil that remembered her first calling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is vividly specific and constrains choice—her tactile navigation and the soil chamber charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her blindness, with emphasis on touch and smell. The setting evolves from books to soil, mirroring her internal shift. Overhead skylight and dark soil create a resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—the stone's warmth and memories compel her downward journey. The dominant stake (recovering buried self) tightens through a cadence shift (mercury to soil). Cost is felt in her abandonment of prophecy for gardening. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (stone, seeds, garden) without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: home is "a talent recovered and transformed." Subtext operates in the stone's "soft warnings" and the garden's blooming words. The concept of buried talents shapes stakes and tactics on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by blindness and prophecy. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("hidden thunder rolled"). Elision (the scholar's departure) is purposeful. The prose reflects her mental state, shifting from metallic to organic rhythms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language ("hidden thunder") is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor scaffold in "each prophecy adding another layer" slightly restates but doesn't harm momentum. Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating in discovery beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of seer and gardener feels fresh and inevitable. The labyrinthine bookstore as a mountain is a non-obvious setting that heightens stakes. Risk-taking in the lyric resolution pays off without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
