<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Margot’s dry wit and obsession are consistently embodied, and her micro-choice to share the phrasebook reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her internal contradiction—professional duty versus personal pursuit—is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final decision feels earned by prior causality and her established character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds: the falcon’s arrival triggers the condensation discovery, which leads to the inspector’s arrival and the final charged poise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost felt in the "held breath" final image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen lake and outpost pressure choices and charge the final image. The condensation on the glass is a micro-setting that constrains a key choice (the map overlay). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Margot’s professional and obsessive priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Margot’s discovery narrows her options and raises the cost of her secret. The inspector’s arrival applies coherent pressure that forces her stance crystallization. The dominant stake (finding the rivers) is tested with a visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of buried truths and patient water emerges through events and images, not statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture (the falcon’s cry) and implication (the phrasebook as a rosetta stone).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in descriptions like "frozen lake stretched like a cataract eye." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("frozen lake stretched like a cataract eye") is vivid and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally and supports the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh angle on exploration narratives. The combination of cartography, linguistics, and hydrology feels organic and specific. The final reconfiguration feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the quiet, charged ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
