<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, inherited trait. Her actions are consistent and her final choice to add her own story is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost. The weight of legacy is embodied, not just stated, though the discovery of Voss's diary feels slightly convenient, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens fits best, as meaning builds through layered discoveries. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira's final act of adding her whisper redefines her legacy from a burden to a purpose. The cost is legible in her disappearance back into the green world, a quiet but felt forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ivy-choked setting is indispensable, constraining Mira's movement and shaping her discoveries. The environment is a character itself, charged with memory and purpose. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, with the "ivy-veiled passage" and archive fireplace directly enabling the plot's key turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled as preserving human memory. Escalation is driven by Mira's agency in following the clues from the film negative and Voss's diary, leading to a meaningful deepening of her understanding. The cost is the acceptance of her solitary role, a tangible and felt price for her mission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of memory and legacy, resisting moralizing. The final image of Mira adding her whisper to the collection offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's action and stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and effectively filtered through Mira's specialized perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that supports the accumulative mode. The single line "The walls dream of us" risks thematic echo but is earned by the prior context and remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor deductions for occasional dense figurative language ("whispered with their own peculiar acoustics") that slightly slows momentum in high-pressure beats. However, the language remains purposeful and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of an echo cartographer in a green-apocalypse world is highly original and fully committed to. The combination of climate fiction, archival mystery, and almost supernatural perception feels fresh and is executed with specific, grounded detail that avoids cliché.</comment>
