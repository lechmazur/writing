<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between her performed masculinity and true self is embodied and drives her final choice. Her unwrapping is a decisive physical act earned by prior causality, with the cost of abandoning her old life legible on the page. Torven's shift from aggression to vulnerable asking provides crucial relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered imagery and emotional revelations toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive change (Mira's unwrapping and wading into the surf) that reconfigures her identity with a visible cost. The scrimshaw's heat and the whale's song provide coherent, taught patterns that pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is a micro-setting that actively pressures the final choice and charges the closure image. The whalebone scrimshaw, a recurring object, constrains choice and pulses with heat, its properties directly influencing the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from finding the scrimshaw to the confrontation with Torven to the final choice at the water's edge. The dominant stake (finding freedom/authenticity) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost of abandoning her old life and clothes is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of shedding constructed selves emerges organically from concrete particulars—the chest bindings, Torven's pretence, the baker's poetry. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the island and the act of unwrapping, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature in the prose's fluid rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext, especially in Torven's "combative tenderness." A slight risk of thematic echo in Torven's final dialogue about barnacles is mitigated by its concrete, character-specific metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of potential label-speak ("authentic souls") in the final paragraph is a hairline slip but does not significantly obscure the closure image or break causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-violence world, a disappearing island, and a trans narrative feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The specific, grounded choice of a dock worker's disguise provides a memorable and authentic perspective on the theme.</comment>
