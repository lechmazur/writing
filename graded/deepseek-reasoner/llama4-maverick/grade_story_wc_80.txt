<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The surveyor's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied through tactile interaction with the past. However, the interiority lacks significant contradiction or a moment of genuine struggle under pressure, keeping it from the highest band. The final renunciation (leaving the inkwell) feels earned but the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the empty inkwell reweighting the theme of absence. The cost is legible in the final paragraphs. The lens holds firmly, though the piece lacks a single, defining persistent constraint that actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV. The submerged pavilion functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, it does not concretely constrain a pivotal choice; the surveyor's actions are not limited or directly enabled by the environment in a decisive way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative weight of discovery, a deepening that changes knowledge under the textural lens. The dominant stake (uncovering stories) is clear. The cost of the surveyor's solitude and the palpable sense of loss is felt, though it manifests more as a mood than a consequence that narrows on-page options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of preserving memory through the potent symbol of the empty inkwell. It avoids moralizing, instead sitting with complex, poignant ambiguity about loss and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice—"stoically sensitive"—is maintained throughout, with diction and syntax reflecting the character's contemplative nature. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the phrase "hushed blaze" feels slightly contrived and the description "interlaced absence" edges toward thematic echo. These are small blemishes in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core concept of an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is a fresh, poignant synthesis. The execution is strong and specific, though the premise of a solitary figure uncovering the past is a familiar archetype. The story executes it with high competence and emotional truth rather than transformative ingenuity.</comment>
