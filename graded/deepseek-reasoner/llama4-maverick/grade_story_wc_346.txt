<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling their high-stakes task. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the awe is monolithic. The final endurance is earned, with a visible cost in the "burden of bruised awe."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost in the "burden of bruised awe." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held through the pattern of hush and nested patterns. A -0.3 deduction for lens ambiguity; the causal mechanism of "nested patterns" is not taught, leaving the closure's "how" somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk and the broken puppet head are masterfully integrated, both constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protecting time's balance) is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a single, decisive cadence shift as the hush deepens and the lullaby is whispered. The cost is legible but could be more visceral; the escalation is more atmospheric than agent-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of the broken puppet, the hush, and the lullaby, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about fragility and balance. The final image of the shimmering pane reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though the perceptual signature could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. A minor -0.4 deduction for a template cadence run ("The hush that surrounded them...", "It was across this hush...") and slightly overripe diction ("bruised awe") in a peak beat, which slightly dulls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a clock adjuster using a puppet to whisper a lullaby to time is highly original and feels organic. The combination is a specific, non-obvious synthesis, though the execution leans on familiar lyrical tropes of fragility and balance, preventing a higher score.</comment>
