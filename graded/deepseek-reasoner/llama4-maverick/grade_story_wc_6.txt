<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria’s internal contradiction—firefighter/arsonist’s daughter—is embodied in her actions and reflections, particularly when grafting the tree, revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance of compassionate endurance is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost could be more sharply felt in the closure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aria crystallizes her purpose, with cost legible in the final image of tending to scars. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through reflective shards and atmospheric pressure. A minor deduction for a slight lag in momentum during the radio call transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not just vivid but functionally constrain choice and charge the final image; the sand stirs in the pouch as Aria finds her calling, and the environment actively mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to the decisive grafting action, which narrows options and reweights the stake of healing. The cost is visible in the charred tree and the emotional determination to make scars sing, though the pressure could tighten more sharply mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grafting action and the final image of rain and new life, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing scars. The concept of "unyielding compassion" is integrated through specific events, avoiding moralizing, though the wise woman's quote edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature ("kelp-drift peace"). Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the tree, the coin) and interleaved with micro-choices, though minor filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy at peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with strong sensory selection. A minor deduction for a template cadence in the final paragraphs ("She stood there...", "As the night wore on...") and a slight over-reliance on "sense of" constructions, which marginally dilute the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter and healer feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, reflective structure. However, the core concept of "scars can sing" leans toward a familiar trope, though it is transformed through the specificity of grafting and volcanic sand.</comment>
