<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The historian's motivation ("steadily unpredictable curiosity") is clear and drives the action. Her internal experience of "anguished joy" is embodied and specific, though the final transformation feels more told than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and conceptual density. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (transformed perception), though the cost of this change is implied rather than felt on the page in a specific, concrete moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is vividly rendered and functions as a micro-setting that pressures the choice to use the pagoda. The "bronze prism pagoda at twilight" is a key object that charges the final image, constraining the action and reconfiguring its meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift (using the pagoda) that deepens the dominant stake of discovery. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the reweighting of the protagonist's perception is clear and legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "atoms of nostalgia" emerges organically from the narrative and is integrated into the climax, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the pursuit of knowledge. The final image of the pagoda reflecting her "transformed perception" provides a coherent thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is consistent, though it occasionally drifts into a slightly elevated register ("unmitigated truth") that feels slightly detached from the historian's immediate embodied experience in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a register drift in high-pressure beats (e.g., "across the end of innocence, a threshold beyond which lay a realm of unmitigated truth"). This creates a slight loss of momentum and clarity at a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a mystical object, a conceptual core, and an academic setting feels fresh and specific. The central premise of perception-purification through pattern avoidance is an original and ingeniously integrated angle on a discovery narrative.</comment>
