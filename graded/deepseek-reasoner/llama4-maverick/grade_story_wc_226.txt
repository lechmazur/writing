<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, with a credible epiphany earned through poetic action. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure, relying more on summary than in-scene struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the peace and readiness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through poetic density. A minor orientation delay in the first paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon, mist, and spire are vividly specific and purpose-driven, constraining choice by shaping her art and charging the final revelation. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artistic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the intensifying poetry sessions, which actively reshape the mist and draw the spire closer. The cost is legible in her changed understanding and readiness, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness's price is explored through concrete action and image, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final realization feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, perceptive signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, supporting the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "forged hush," creating a slight figurative muddle, but clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The combination of a bone canyon, art that refracts truth, and a thematic focus on forgiveness is a fresh, specific synthesis. The world and concept feel organic and inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
