<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in a personal void that gives her quest emotional weight. Her obsession feels authentic, and the final realization about her self-deception is a credible, earned micro-choice that deepens her character. However, the transition from corporate archivist to determined detective, while compelling, could benefit from a more embodied, on-page struggle to make the shift feel less declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Causal, with strong because/therefore linkages from the numbers clue to the final revelation. Closure is a successful Conceptual Repricing: the archived files reconfigure the entire premise with a clear, felt cost of obsession and transformation. The final image of the "digital abyss" and the stopped numbers lands with resonant weight, though the conspiracy message from the "unknown user" feels slightly under-integrated into the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "labyrinth of servers" and "digital detritus" effectively function as a micro-setting that pressures Lena's choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional focus. The patch is a key object, though its physical handling could be more tactile to further constrain choice and heighten its reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the Causal lens, as each discovery of the numbers narrows her options and deepens her obsession. The dominant stake (uncovering the truth) is clear and tightens meaningfully. The cost of her transformation is legible on the page, though the pressure could feel more immediately threatening in the middle beats to heighten the tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of digital ghosts and the nature of memory, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: absence becomes a source of wonder, not pain. The recurring numbers and "echo of forgotten songs" are motifs that successfully charge the closure without being tokenistic, transforming the central question of loss into discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filters the world through Lena's specialized, obsessive perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm that supports the thematic pressure. The line "Don't lie to yourself, Lena" is a potent moment of narrated thought that deepens interiority. A very slight register drift occurs near the end with phrases like "digital abyss," but it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences effectively advance atmosphere and character. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn around "absence" and "void" in the final paragraphs, and the phrase "digital detritus" feels slightly academic, though not enough to seriously harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate espionage, digital archaeology, and personal grief feels fresh and organic. The concept of a "corporate memory keeper" investigating a cold case via metadata is a specific, non-obvious angle. The transformation of the numbers from clue to map to ghostly signature demonstrates ingenuity, though the conspiracy element is a more familiar trope that is handled competently rather than transformed.</comment>
