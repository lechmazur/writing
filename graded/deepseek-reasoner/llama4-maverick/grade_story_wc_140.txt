<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular, with a clear, consistent motivation. However, the character's actions are primarily observational; a lack of contradictory impulses or a micro-choice under peak pressure prevents a higher score. The final endurance is credible but not fully dramatized with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the final image of the labyrinth as a "monument" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the tide's rhythm providing a coherent structural pattern. A minor deduction for a slightly abstracted cost at the very end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, creating a powerful atmosphere. The labyrinth and poison bottle label are potent recurring images. However, the environment describes rather than constrains a pivotal choice; it charges the final image but does not force a tactical alteration, capping the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative layering of stories, which deepens understanding and reweights the dominant stake of rediscovery. The cost is legible in the survivor's contemplative pace at the end. The pressure is coherent but lacks a single, decisive tightening that forecloses a live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and specific actions, resisting direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory. The integration is nearly flawless, with the poison bottle label serving as a potent, earned motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the survivor's perceptive signature. The prose has a distinct, contemplative rhythm suited to the accumulative mode. A minor deduction for a occasional repetitive sentence stems ("The survivor's...") that slightly dull the voice's distinctness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor text artifact exists: a run of sentences starting with "The survivor's..." or "The labyrinth..." creates a template cadence that slightly reduces propulsion, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of reconstructing erased histories is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. The execution is specific and committed, though the prose cadence has a conventional quality that prevents a top-tier score for sheer ingenuity.</comment>
