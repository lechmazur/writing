<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aria's altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot. However, the settlers, including Lyra, function more as a collective entity than distinct individuals, lacking the contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure that would elevate the score. Their reactions are uniformly trusting and cooperative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres beautifully. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the final image of the transformed, pulsing landscape making the cost of collective effort and achieved harmony legible and felt. The drive lens holds from the early establishment of community building to the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, creating a lush, specific atmosphere. The floating rock arches and the butterfly garden are particularly strong. The setting provides a rich backdrop and symbolic weight, though it could more directly constrain character choices to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the settlers' collective agency in deciphering Aria's plan and harnessing the nebula's energy. The dominant stake of community survival and growth tightens meaningfully, and the cost is legible in the transformative effort described. The shift in the planet's energy signature is a decisive, earned deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the narrative particulars—community, collective effort, and harmony with nature—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer embodied by the transformed landscape and the pulsing pathways. The final image reweights the prior struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person omniscient voice is stable and apt, with a consistent, lyrical texture. However, a reliance on filter verbs like "had seen," "had created," and "began to sense" slightly distances the reader from immediate experience, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight overuse of compound sentences and some abstract phrasing ("brambled hope," "strangely trustworthy nature") that, while purposeful, edges toward telling. The closure image, however, is clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of an altruistic ghost, an orchard planet, and a energy-harnessing nebula feels fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with authenticity, synthesizing familiar ideas into a singular, memorable vision that avoids cliché.</comment>
