<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation and embodied interiority, particularly in the connection to the sextant. However, the final shift where her sense of self is drawn into the mirror lacks a visible, felt cost on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative lens, with the final image of the glass mountains reconfiguring reality. The cost, while conceptually clear, is felt more as transcendence than loss, slightly muting its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric, with the fog and frost acting as a persistent environmental pressure. The sextant charges the final image, but the environment itself does not decisively constrain a choice to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—finding the sextant and performing the breathing ritual—which meaningfully deepens the stakes under the Accumulative lens. The cost of her vanishing is legible but operates more on a conceptual than a visceral level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of erasing boundaries is expertly integrated, emerging organically from the character's actions and the story's imagery. The final image of the glass mountains offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, ethereal perceptual signature that remains consistent and effectively modulated under pressure. The lyrical compression is purposeful and taught, paying off in the closure's haunting final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential register drift ("morbid perfume") is brief and voice-motivated, not harming clarity or momentum at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mirror maker, a broken sextant, and glass mountains feels fresh and organic. The concept is executed with a confident, singular vision, though it echoes familiar lyrical fantasy tropes without fully transcending them.</comment>
