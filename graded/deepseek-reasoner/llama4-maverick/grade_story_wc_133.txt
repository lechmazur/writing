<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The painter's obsession is a clear, compelling motive that drives the narrative. However, the emotional state of "haggard awe" is more told than shown through embodied contradiction in the final beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds strongly from discovery to exchange. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the brooch is integrated into art, reconfiguring the island's meaning with a felt cost of obsession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tidal island is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent. However, while it supplies the brooch and rain trails, it does not sufficiently constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal solace to uncovering a world-altering secret. The exchange with the stranger is a clear, agency-driven tightening that narrows options and deepens knowledge, though the cost of the trade feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of meaning in ruin. The final image of the brooch glowing in the artwork offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of processing trauma and history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the painter's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent. The prose effectively filters the world through a creative, insomniac lens, with a controlled rhythm that supports the contemplative mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, effectively building atmosphere. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a hint of thesaurus-churn (e.g., "inexplicable connection," "wryly earnest sense").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic setting, artistic protagonist, and mystical artifact feels organic and specific. The concept is strong, though the execution hews closely to familiar tropes of discovering a key to the past, limiting a top score.</comment>
