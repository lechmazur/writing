<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The skimmer is a compelling non-human POV with a clear, consistent motivation. Its weathered resolve is a credible stance, and its final synchronization with the land's pulse is an Earned Stasis with a felt cost. However, its internal process is occasionally abstract ("felt the familiar thrum of a pulse"), lacking the concrete, embodied contradiction required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is masterful. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the skimmer's synchronization with the land's rhythm is a decisive change with a palpable cost of timeless endurance. The pattern of dust accumulation and observational beats builds pressure cleanly toward this end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral. The "canyon of endless echoes" and "towers of bone" are not just backdrop; they actively charge the final image and constrain the skimmer's mode of navigation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the skimmer's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the deepening density of the skimmer's perception and the gradual synchronization of the pulse. The dominant stake of attunement tightens meaningfully, and the cost of eternal, motionless vigilance is legible on the page, though the agency is more passive reception than active pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of navigation through stillness. The final image offers a profound, non-literal answer to this premise, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The integration of patience, perception, and connection to land is seamless and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, meditative voice suited to the ancient, observant skimmer. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively to build the accumulative pattern. There is no head-hopping or register drift to break the hypnotic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and a controlled rhythm. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("multisensory awareness") and a slight over-reliance on "harmonic resonance" as a refrain, which creates a subtle template cadence. However, these do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a sentient stone skimmer navigating through millennia of observation is highly original and executed with authenticity. The synthesis of a non-human POV, a philosophical goal, and a mythic setting feels fresh and inevitable, not derivative. The risk of a passive protagonist pays off.</comment>
