<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The noticer's motivation for seeking peace and connection is clear and consistent, embodied through concrete actions like returning to the tea house. However, her internal contradictions and flaws remain underdeveloped, lacking the contradictory impulses acting in scene required for higher bands. The relationship with the gardener applies secondary pressure, but the noticer's emotional depth is more told than shown under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of fading light reweighting the tenuous absolution with felt cost. The accumulative pattern of repeated visits deepens stakes coherently. The inciting incident (finding bread) relies on mild coincidence but doesn't resolve the conflict, so it's allowable under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The secret tea house and overgrown courtyard are vividly rendered and fundamentally constrain the noticer's choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's bias for tranquility. The environment acts as a micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase and cadence shifts—repeated visits deepen the stake of finding connection. The cost of transience is legible in the "tenuous absolution" and "fading light." Protagonist agency is demonstrated through her conscious return and engagement, though the initial bread discovery is passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of finding sacredness in the ordinary emerges organically through particulars like the bread and gardening, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the key metaphor, reweighting prior material. However, the concept of "tenuous absolution" is slightly over-articulated in the text, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Elision (e.g., the bakery's disappearance) is taught and paid off in the closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously, as in the description of the tea house's organic structure. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" concept is fresh and specific, transforming a familiar trope through grounded details. The quiet, accumulative structure is a risk that coheres, with the ending feeling inevitable. The synthesis of guerrilla gardening and personal absolution is non-obvious and organically integrated.</comment>
