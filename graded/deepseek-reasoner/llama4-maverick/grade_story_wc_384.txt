<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forger's motivation ("to forgive the unfinished") is clear and compelling, rooted in a credible moral stance. However, interiority leans toward summary ("a sense of pride and accomplishment") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice is earned but lacks a visible, on-page cost to fully ground the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory and symbolic density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on the page with a felt cost ("a sense of peace") and the lens holds. The key's mechanics, however, remain abstract ("both literal and metaphorical"), creating a minor causality ambiguity that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary and aurora are vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. The heritage rose thorn successfully charges the final image, transitioning from a painful reminder to a symbol of beauty and complexity. While the setting establishes tone, it applies minimal tangible pressure on the forger's choices, preventing a top score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift in descriptive density, reweighting the dominant stake of narrative subversion. The cost of the "calibrated treason" is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, and the protagonist's agency, while clear, is not severely tested by external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the integration of concept ("calibrated treason"), action ("unlink"), and object (the thorn). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of revising history, avoiding moralizing. The subversion of a harmful document provides a coherent and potent thematic core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is confident and the perceptual signature is strong, particularly in descriptions like "pearl twilight hue." There is a slight tendency toward elevated summary in interiority, but it remains legible and consistent, supporting the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("utterly distinct" used twice) and occasional register drift into summary ("a sense of peace wash over her"). These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher band score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core premise of forgery as a subversive, moral act is fresh and compellingly executed. The synthesis of specific elements (sanctuary, aurora, thorn, key) feels organic and singular. The concept is fully committed to without gimmickry, though it leans on familiar archetypes (the solitary artisan).</comment>
