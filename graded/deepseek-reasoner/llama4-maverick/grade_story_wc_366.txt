<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skipper's warmly observant nature and internal conflict between skepticism and unease are embodied through concrete action (picking up the glass, stacking stones). His final resolve to protect the lighthouse is earned by the ritual, though the phrase "luminescent ache" veers toward diagnostic labeling, slightly abstracting a peak emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and emotional density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the stone-stacking ritual. The closure lands with cost felt in the skipper's resolve and the glowing cairn, which reconfigures his relationship to the lighthouse's sorrow. Causality is tight and orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as a micro-setting that pressures the skipper's observation, and the sea glass and stones are recurring objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through the POV, with the environment actively mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift: the skipper's proactive decision to stack stones reweights the dominant stake of safety and longing, moving from observation to action. The cost is legible in the meditative motion calming his internal ache and the resulting resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of safety, longing, and protective ritual, resisting moralizing. The final image of the glowing cairn and the skipper's resolve offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to hold onto light against darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture, and any elision (e.g., the keeper's off-page presence) is purposeful and paid off in the skipper's solitary actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive with high information density. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in phrases like "luminescent ache" and the near-paraphrase between "deep and abiding sorrow" and "luminescent ache," which creates a small loop in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a reticent skipper, sea glass, anonymous letters, and stone-stacking rituals feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform familiar Gothic tropes into a singular, authentic vision of quiet endurance.</comment>
