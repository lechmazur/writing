<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's claustrophobia and motivation to collect silences are clear and rooted in consistent traits. Embodied emotion is strong ("felt the atmosphere thicken"), and the final endurance/renunciation feels earned. A minor deduction for the slightly conceptual phrasing "flavors of different silences," which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost ("claustrophobia had not vanished, but it was no longer the dominant force"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a cadence shift. Orientation is immediate, and the taught pattern of the gilded hush pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, filtered through Eli's perception. However, it primarily functions as a evocative backdrop rather than actively constraining a choice or charging the final image, preventing a 9+ score. The porcelain doll comes closer to this micro-setting function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification through the density of the gilded hush experience. The dominant stake (overcoming fear) is clear, and the cost is legible. The protagonist's agency is one of attentive endurance, which is valid, though the pressure is more atmospheric than actively complicating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding growth in unexpected solace emerges organically from the particulars of the trellis and the gilded hush. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the doll and the "stretching presence," reweighting the initial premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates effectively under pressure ("seeds taking root in fertile soil"). The prose possesses a strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight figurative density in the climax ("seeds taking root," "tapestry") that, while beautiful, softens the immediacy of the peak beat. No loops, scaffolds, or major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a "gilded hush" that carries silences is highly original and ingeniously integrated. The combination of claustrophobia and an open, suspended setting feels fresh and specific. The story fully commits to its lyrical, accumulative premise.</comment>
