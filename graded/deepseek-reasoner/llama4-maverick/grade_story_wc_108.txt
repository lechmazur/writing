<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction (fearful stunt double) is well-established, and the motivation to prove "vulnerability is power" is a clear driver. However, the final epiphany feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized through a micro-choice under pressure, with the line "I was ready to take on the world" summarizing a shift instead of embodying it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change, a shift in resolve, with a felt cost of relinquishing an old identity. The causal lens holds: the decryption leads directly to the revelation. The cost, however, is more declared than viscerally felt on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rusted library and whispering seashell are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's urgency. The library applies subtle pressure, but the seashell's role is more symbolic than a constraint that actively alters tactics, capping the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in decrypting the note, which meaningfully deepens their knowledge and narrows their options under the causal lens. The stake (self-acceptance) is clear, though the pressure's intensification is more intellectual than viscerally coercive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of embracing vulnerability emerges organically from the character's struggle. However, the final paragraph leans toward explicit thematic statement ("to prove that vulnerability is power") rather than trusting the resonant, non-literal image of walking into a brighter future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and effectively filters the world through a stressed, introspective lens. The voice is distinct and consistent, though some phrases like "trembling certainty" verge on oxymoronic without deeper textual support, creating a minor hiccup in an otherwise controlled narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("firmly adaptive nature" used twice) and a declarative summary in the climax ("I was ready to take on the world") that slightly dulls the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of a phobia-ridden stunt double and a transformative betrayal in a rusted library feels fresh and specific. The core concept is integrated well, though the resolution leans on a familiar epiphany structure, preventing a top-tier score for ingenuity.</comment>
