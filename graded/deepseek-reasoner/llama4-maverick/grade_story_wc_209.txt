<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Luna’s interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her tactile connection to the postcards. Her motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling a credible shift from vibrant to contemplative art. The final renunciation of her bold style for a quieter one is earned by her on-page journey, though the transition could be more sharply dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Luna's perception shifts, reconfiguring her art and understanding. The cost is felt in her altered artistic voice and the pavilion's new quiet. The pattern of layered images (postcards, glass, flowers) is taught early and pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The window's etched glass provides the key narrative that seeps into Luna's being, directly shaping her artistic choices and the story's closure. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake of understanding. The pressure coheres as Luna's perception deepens, narrowing her artistic options toward a quieter expression. The cost is the loss of her vibrant style, felt in the pavilion's new silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, darkness, and hidden layers, resisting direct statement. The final image of the world blooming alongside her offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. Subtext operates powerfully in the whispered stories of her new murals and the umbral tenderness that infuses her.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Luna's artistic perception. The prose has a distinct, contemplative texture that modulates with her emotional intensity. Some minor register drift occurs ("umbral tenderness" feels slightly elevated for her lexicon), but the voice remains coherent and purposefully lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "The [noun]," and a minor paraphrase loop occurs around "secrets" and "mysteries." These artifacts are slight and do not materially obscure the closure's clarity or cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mural artist, cathedral glass, and nocturnal botany feels fresh and organic. The specific angle on understanding nature through art, rather than science, offers a non-obvious perspective. The risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres with the thematic premise.</comment>
