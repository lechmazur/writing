<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. The artist's epiphany feels earned, though her motivation shift ("desire to lance the boil") is slightly abrupt, lacking a clear on-page trigger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of the detective's "newfound depth." The fragment's late introduction is a minor flaw, but its payoff at closure mitigates this.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional. The mist and quarry are not just atmospheric but actively constrain perception and choice. The mask fragment evolves from curiosity to a symbol that charges the final image, perfectly fulfilling the micro-setting role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is subtle but present under the Accumulative lens, achieved through a cadence shift and emotional deepening. The cost is legible in the artist's renewed commitment, though the pressure could be more overtly tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges organically from the particulars of the artist's method and the detective's quest. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration is nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive, textured quality. POV is stable. The dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though the detective's epiphany speech borders on exposition, slightly straining naturalism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight density in peak beats (e.g., "lance the boil of her own emotional numbness" feels slightly therapeutic) and a template cadence in "The detective's voice was a low, furrowed hush."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a face-blind artist capturing essence is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The execution feels organic and committed to its vision, transforming familiar tropes of cold cases and artistic epiphany through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
