<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tuner's "infinitely patient" trait is embodied in deliberate action and filters perception, but interior contradiction is limited; the final endurance is credible under the accumulative lens, though the motivation ("shared balance") edges toward abstract theme-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear on-page cost in the town's "gentle quiver" and the "whispered promise of renewal." Orientation is immediate and the pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones function as micro-settings that actively constrain and enable the tuner's method; the ancient archway looms as a persistent symbol. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the rhythmic action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift that deepens the stake; the rhythmic pattern grows "stronger, more insistent," culminating in the town's response. The cost of the tuner's vigil is felt in the palpable stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of revival through rhythm emerges organically from concrete action and image; the final "sound of a town reborn" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though "shared balance" is a slightly overt thematic label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to sound and vibration. The prose rhythm expertly mirrors the tuner's method. No dialogue present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of "wild hush" and a near-paraphrase loop ("stir from their slumber" / "sleeper awakening"). Rhythm is expertly controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bell tuner reviving a ghost town through rhythmic footsteps is a specific, non-obvious, and fully committed premise. The concept is executed with authenticity and transforms its familiar components into a singular vision.</comment>
