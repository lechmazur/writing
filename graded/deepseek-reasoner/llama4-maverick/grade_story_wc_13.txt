<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, but her emotional state is more told than embodied. The final change is earned through her agency, though internal contradiction is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost on the page ("a faint tremor beneath her feet"). Orientation is immediate and pattern is taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful. The rooftop canal and pendant function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though their constraint on choice is indirect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (finding echoes) tightens through her spell, with cost legible in the giant's stirring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and infinite perception emerges organically from events. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a lyrical, observant quality. Prose reflects Lyra's perceptual signature, and purposeful compression is effective. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Generally strong with vivid imagery, but occasional overwriting ("sculpts time itself by an invisible hand") and a minor paraphrase loop ("borrow fragments of the giant's time" / "borrowed chronology").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of myth and sensory observation. The concept feels fresh and specific to this voice, with risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure that coheres.</comment>
