<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Naomi's motivation is clear and intensifies through engagement with Ada, but internal contradiction is underdeveloped. Her emotional embodiment is strong ("heart still ablaze"), but the final endurance feels slightly tidy rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern-building through diary and debris messages. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as understanding deepens with cost felt in Naomi's determined return. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered and constrain choice—the lagoon draws Naomi, library enables discovery. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her archival perspective, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (truth-seeking) escalate through parley, tightening understanding under Accumulative lens. Agency is in Naomi's engagement, foreclosing ignorance with cost in her renewed resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory/truth emerges through diary and debris patterns without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material non-literally. Minor echo in "searing reverie" label slightly diminishes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("floated through the hanger-like interior"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Elision (diary's exact secrets) is taught and paid off in reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, though "solemn" repeats. No loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language ("heart ablaze") supports pressure without muddle. Minor scaffold in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of zeppelin library, retrocognition, and civil-rights archivism feels inevitable. Risk-taking with accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
