<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glazier's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear motivation to seek meaning. However, the emotional state remains largely static and declarative ("felt a sense of peace," "felt a sense of wonder") without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate this to the highest band. The final stance crystallization is thematically coherent but lacks a visible, felt cost that would charge the renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres, building density through reflective observation. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the glazier's purpose. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt; the final image reweights meaning but lacks a tangible price paid on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, filtered through the glazier's professional eye. The bay and the prism atrium are not merely decorative; the ripples in the water act as a micro-setting that directly enables the protagonist's key realization, constraining her perception and charging the final thematic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (seeking meaning) and escalate through a deepening of perception, consistent with the accumulative lens. The catalyst (the fisherman's stone) is a minor coincidence that complicates but feels slightly external to the glazier's agency. The cost of her renewed commitment remains conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glazier's specific perception and the central image of reflected/refracted light. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of finding value. It avoids moralizing, though the concept of "noctilucent reckonings" edges toward thematic echo in its abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the glazier's perceptive, analytical consciousness. The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The single paragraph of dialogue-free narration is a purposeful choice that suits the meditative mode. A slight over-reliance on "sense of" phrases creates minor template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. It successfully avoids summary in pivotal beats. Minor artifacts are present, including a template cadence from repeated "She felt a sense of..." constructions and a register drift into slightly elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings") that feels less native to the POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of a reflective artisan and a misty bay at dawn feels fresh, and the core concept is intriguing. The execution is strong but the central epiphany, while earned, hinges on a slightly familiar trope of reading patterns in nature. The synthesis is specific and coherent but not wholly transformative of its components.</comment>
