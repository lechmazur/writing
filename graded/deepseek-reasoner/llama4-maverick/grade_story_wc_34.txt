<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned, though the "tinkersong" trait feels more label than active constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost of connection and altered significance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the "ghost in code" concept is more thematic than a causal agent narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courtyard is a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice to create, constraining the balladeer's actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the storm's intensification forcing a stance crystallization. The cost of the connection is legible, though the dominant stake (articulating the unspoken) remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection through creation. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the courtyard and the act of encoding, avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. The voice is consistent and effectively modulated, with purposeful elision (e.g., the specific symbols) that serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "a tinkersong wonder that would linger"). No loops or scaffold artifacts, but a slight density of figurative language slightly mutes clarity at the very end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical setting, a technological ghost, and graffiti art feels fresh and organic. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on communication, fully committed to and executed within its singular vision.</comment>
