<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The druid's motivation is clear and their "warlike serenity" is a compelling, embodied contradiction. However, interiority relies on summary ("a mix of trepidation and determination") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to continue is earned, but the cost of the revelation is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: the realization that mirrors show the soul. The Causal lens holds, driven by the druid's attribute. The frozen figure's appearance is slightly convenient but pays off. The cost is legible in the "beautiful and terrifying" revelation, though its personal impact on the druid could be more sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, creating a potent atmosphere of decay and menace. The setting actively pressures the druid's movement ("spongy and uneven" ground). However, the environment does not decisively constrain a key choice; the trees watch but do not force a tactical alteration, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency: the druid chooses to touch the ice, triggering the climax. This action meaningfully tightens the situation by releasing the figure and the mirror, irrevocably changing the druid's knowledge. The cost of this new, terrifying understanding is the dominant stake and is clearly legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from the central action and image. The concept of "what mirrors don't show" is answered not with a stated moral but with a resonant, non-literal revelation that reweights the entire quest. The final image of the path forward is charged with the cost and weight of this new knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistently filtered through the druid's perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the eerie atmosphere. The single line of dialogue-free internal monologue is well-integrated. The voice maintains its distinct perceptual signature throughout under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong and atmospheric, but suffers from minor artifacts. A template cadence emerges in sentences starting with "The druid..." or "The [noun]...". Some near-paraphrasing occurs (e.g., "ready to face whatever lay ahead"/"prepared to face it head-on"). These patterns slightly dull the closure's impact but do not break causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a "frozen confession" is a fresh, ingenious inflection on a quest narrative. The combination of a druid with a specific attribute, a flesh-eating seed, and this goal feels organic and singular. The resolution transforms the familiar trope of a magic mirror into a moment of profound and terrifying self-discovery.</comment>
