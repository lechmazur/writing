<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's motivation is clear and rooted in their trait of a "spatially imaginative mind," compelling their initial choice. However, the peak action of psychometry is more observational than an active choice under pressure, and the final "understanding" is an epiphany received rather than an earned change forged through on-page struggle, muting the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly dominant, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift into the vision. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing with the cost of the gazer now carrying the "weight of the unused love," making the before/after change legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The projection booth and the film strip are not just described but function as the story's crucible and key object, actively constraining the choice to perform psychometry and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception and the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a single, meaningful intensification into the visionary sea of letters. The dominant stake of uncovering a hidden truth is clear. However, the pressure feels external (emanating from the film) rather than driven by the protagonist's active agency, which limits the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of enduring, unused love emerges powerfully from the specific image of the swirling letters and the final realization. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question without moralizing. The integration is organic, though the final paragraph's "reminder of the mysteries" slightly leans toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature ("scent of old celluloid and dust," "sea of correspondence"). The voice modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the vision. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a minor prose artifact appears: a near-paraphrase loop between "enduring power of love" and "enduring power of human emotion" in close succession, which slightly dulls the momentum of a key thematic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a crystal gazer in a movie palace using psychometry on a film strip is a fresh, specific, and organic synthesis. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on exploring memory and emotion, executed with a coherent and authentic vision that avoids feeling derivative or templated.</comment>
