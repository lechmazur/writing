<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her systematic actions. However, interiority lacks concrete contradiction; her "foxglove regret" is more a stated label than an embodied, contradictory impulse acting in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the song reweights the library's atmosphere. The cost is legible in the "faint, melancholic smile" and the acknowledgement her task is "never truly done."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal library and glass orchids are vividly specific and purpose-driven, filtering through the caretaker's reverence. The cracked wind chime crucially constrains the song's effect and charges the final image with its "haunting melody," satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is textural, achieved through the density increase of the sung song and its alchemical effect on the light. This deepening reweights the dominant stake of preservation, and the cost of endless labor is felt, though agency in initiating the song is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the integration of setting and action, exploring memory and loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the glowing library. A minor deduction for the slightly overt phrasing of "enduring power of memory."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the caretaker's perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the song's cadence, and purposeful elision (e.g., the song's specifics) serves the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the caretaker's purpose (e.g., "preserve the sound... echoes of a past"), and the phrase "foxglove regret" risks decorative labeling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glass-orchid caretaker in an opal library preserving a museum of extinct feelings is highly original and organic. The core concept is committed to fully and executed with a singular, authentic vision that feels inevitable.</comment>
