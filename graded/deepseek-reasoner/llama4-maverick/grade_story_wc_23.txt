<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, compelling her journey. Her internal conflict is embodied through the handling of the censer foot and her fluctuating senses, showing contradictory impulses. A credible endurance is earned, foreclosing a path with visible cost at the end. The final choice to move forward feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, with closure as an Earned Stasis—acceptance of loss and a decision to move forward. The cost is legible on the page: "a vast expanse of nothingness" and the felt "sense of acceptance." The lens holds, though the cryptic calls introduce a minor causal ambiguity that doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and the censer foot are masterfully integrated, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's grief. The censer foot evolves from a comfort object to a symbol of resilience, actively shaping the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the navigator's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the accumulation of clues and lunar phases. The dominant stake (reclaiming the past) is signaled early and deepens. The cost is legible in the final image of the "great, empty plain," representing the acceptance of irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the navigation of loss and memory, resisting tidy morals. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief. The reconfiguration of "geography of loss" into a "topography of loss and memory" provides a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects the navigator's perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled, though a slight register drift occurs with "geography of loss," feeling more conceptual than embodied. The voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a template cadence is detected in consecutive sentences starting with "The navigator..." and a paraphrase loop exists between "geography of loss" and "topography of loss and memory." These minor artifacts slightly dull the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a patchwork navigator, lunar navigation, and reverse migration feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, offering a singular artistic stance.</comment>
