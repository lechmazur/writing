<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's immortal boredom and dimensional awareness are clear, consistent motives that intensify under pressure, compelling the high-stakes experiment. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation of loneliness is earned by the duplicate's emergence, though the emotion "stirred with wonder and trepidation" is slightly told rather than fully embodied in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Kael's actions with the amulet and magnetic fields directly cause the duplicate's emergence and the conceptual repricing of "goodbye." Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the premise with the cost of integrated dark power ("a part of Kael"). Orientation is immediate; who, where, and when are anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated, constraining and amplifying Kael's choices. Sensory details are selective and reflect urgency ("air vibrated with an electric tension"). The escondite functions as a micro-setting that charges the final gateway image, though the solar storm's effect is more atmospheric than tactically limiting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what happens after goodbye) is signaled early and escalates causally through Kael's agency with the magnetic fields and amulet. One meaningful tightening occurs as the energy surges and the duplicate emerges, forcing a trade-off. The cost is legible: the amulet's dark power is now a permanent part of Kael, foreclosing a path of simple existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the experiment and the duplicate's statement ("I am what remains after goodbye"), offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of the multiverse gateway reweights prior material, embracing transformation over cessation. Subtext operates in the symbolic gesture of the mirrored hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the escondite's energy. Diction is consistently elevated yet voice-motivated for an ancient being. The duplicate's dialogue carries subtext and advances the thematic revelation. Minor register drift in "stirred with wonder" is a hairline slip in an otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that accelerate with the storm's intensity. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor scaffold phrase ("Kael's heart, long thought to be still, stirred") slightly dulls the peak beat, but clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal boredom, spatial mutiny, and a cursed object feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in Kael's dimensional awareness and the escondite's properties. The duplicate as an answer to the thematic question is a non-obvious, ingenious turn that heightens stakes.</comment>
