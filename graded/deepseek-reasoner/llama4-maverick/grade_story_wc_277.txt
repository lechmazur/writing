<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Adelaide’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("driven to discover hidden truths"), and her decision to intervene is a credible, high-stakes choice. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the weight of this legacy hung heavy on Adelaide's shoulders"). A meaningful change is earned, as her final determination to uncover the truth forecloses her previous state of burden with a felt cost. However, a minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on summary in the reflective block concerning the family's publishing history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her new determination with a visible cost (the burden of the legacy and the challenge ahead). The inferred drive lens is Causal, and it holds: her decision to use proof by contradiction is a because/therefore linkage that narrows her options and changes her knowledge. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the mist and the "orbits of regret slowly begin[ning] to dissipate." A minor deduction for a slight ambiguity in how the pen nib's "power" functions within the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly described and purposeful, acting as a micro-setting that pressures her choice and charges the final image ("a catalyst for change"). Sensory detail is selective and reflects her urgency. However, the setting does not quite constrain a pivotal choice to reach the 9-band; it is more atmospheric than tactical. The pen nib functions more as an object than part of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (the fate of the Wychwood empire/her family's truth) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the journalist's call and the discovery of the pen nib trigger her decision to employ a logical method, a meaningful tightening that narrows her options. The cost is legible in her determination to act "no matter the cost." A minor deduction as the pressure from the external scandal remains somewhat off-stage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth vs. regret emerges coherently from events and images (the mist, the pen nib, the observatory) rather than direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the family legacy from regret to a challenge. A minor deduction for the phrase "orbits of regret," which edges toward a thematic echo and slightly abstract symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Adelaide's observant, analytical nature. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping. The internal voice is coherent and specific, particularly in the integration of mathematical logic into her thought process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with strong momentum, advancing story and character. Figurative language ("orbits of regret," "web of logic") is purposeful and generally coherent. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the repeated use of "Adelaide's [noun], [adjective]" sentence stems, though it does not significantly obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a newsprint heiress, a logical method, and a magical realist pen nib is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. The risk-taking with the pen nib's ambiguous power heightens meaning without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
