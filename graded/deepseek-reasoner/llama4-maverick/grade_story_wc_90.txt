<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aurora's steadfast pacifism and deep resolve are clear and consistent, compelling her high-stakes choice to engage in shadow work. However, her emotional state is occasionally summarized ("filled with a deep sense of resolve") rather than fully embodied under pressure, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with the stitching of photographs building pattern and density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is achieved on the page with a clear, felt cost ("the weight of their emotions settle upon her") and the final image of the unlocked dimension is charged and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail ("dimly lit corridors," "scent of aged paper"). The photographs and Kwan Yin's Tear function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though the larger environment does not decisively constrain her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening density of memory and emotion as Aurora stitches. The dominant stake of unlocking the dimension is tested by the perilous shadow work, and the cost of emotional weight is legible on the page, charging the final victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of shadow work, compassion, and memory, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unlocked dimension, reweighting the premise of human legacy and the power of repressed emotion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, measured rhythm that suits the contemplative subject. Some sentences verge on overly decorative phrasing ("ghostly resolve," "otherworldly light"), but the perceptual signature remains coherent and the elision of memory entry is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing occur ("a deep sense of resolve," "a mix of emotions"), and a slight register drift in peak beats prevents a higher score, though clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a pacifist in a spaceship using embroidery for dimensional travel is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The concept is fully committed to and feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring the core emotional truth.</comment>
