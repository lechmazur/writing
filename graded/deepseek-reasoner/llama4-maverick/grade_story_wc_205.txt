<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with a clear, consistent motivation that drives the narrative. The final transformation from revolutionary to chronicler is earned by on-page choices and carries a visible cost of "burnished sorrow." However, the poetically inclined trait, while present, is more descriptive than a constraining flaw that complicates choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held, building pressure through reflective density and a cadence shift at closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands on the page with a clear, felt cost in the "burnished sorrow." The only minor slip is a slight summary of the initial dispute rather than full dramatization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly rendered and functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image of the protagonist finding a home "among the shadows and the silence." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the setting could apply more direct pressure on her immediate choices beyond atmospheric reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the discovery of the shard tightening her focus and deepening the stakes. The cost is legible in the "burnished sorrow" that fuels her work. The pressure is coherent, though the external threat of the storm and visible time remains more atmospheric than a direct complicating factor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose through reimagining the past emerges organically from the protagonist's actions and the central image of the shard. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this question without moralizing. The integration of "burnished sorrow" as both a cost and a creative fuel is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a distinct, poetically inclined perceptual signature that remains consistent and controlled under pressure. The prose is purposeful, with a rhythmic quality that supports the accumulative mode. No head-hopping or unmotivated elision occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor instances of near-paraphrase occur (e.g., "reimagine, to recreate, and to rediscover"), and the phrase "burnished sorrow" is repeated frequently, slightly dulling its impact by the closure though not breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a defunct revolutionary, a baroque asteroid, and visible time is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels organic. The core premise is transformed through the protagonist's specific, grounded choices and emotional journey. The risk of a quiet, reflective closure pays off.</comment>
