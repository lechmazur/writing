<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with micro-choices like cautious approach and hand squeeze revealing her values. The woman's embodied grief (tears, tight grip) is effective, but Aria's internal contradiction under pressure is somewhat muted, leaning toward competent assurance rather than struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost (woman's peace, Aria's resolve). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density to the mist clearing. The hearing aid's pulse provides a coherent through-line, though the mechanism of tracking "residual energy" is slightly vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent, mirroring internal states. However, while it charges the final image, it does not actively constrain choices or tactics—Aria navigates it freely rather than being pressured by it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional closure) are clear early. Escalation is driven by Aria's agency in tracking and approaching, culminating in the assurance that reweights the woman's grief. Cost is legible in the woman's shifted demeanor and the mist clearing, though the tension is more emotional than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory and connection emerges organically through the photograph and hearing aid, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the mist clearing and Aria's resolve, though it leans slightly toward thematic echo in "incidental heroism."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Aria's perceptual signature ("persistently curious gaze"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but minor artifacts include repetitive stems ("reeling hush" appears twice) and a slight over-reliance on atmospheric adjectives ("mystical," "otherworldly") in peak beats. Momentum remains strong, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" is fresh and specific, transforming the trope of spiritual mediation through the hearing aid object. Synthesis feels organic, and risk-taking in tone and premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
