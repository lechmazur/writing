<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's motivation ("to interpret silence as possibility") is clear and consistent, driving the key choice to follow the song. However, interiority lacks contradiction; the quietly persistent nature is a single, unwavering note without the internal friction or flawed self-deception required for the highest band. The final, earned insight feels genuine but is built on a stable, not conflicted, foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of the completed horse reconfigures the meaning of the misting hush. Causality is soft but coherent for this lens; the carpenter's pursuit of the song is a motivated ellipsis. A slight orientation delay in the opening paragraph and a marginally soft cost at closure prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively constrains and guides the carpenter's journey, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and wholly integrated with the POV's perception. The halo fragment and wind bells are purposeful objects that evolve in meaning, not mere decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase (the discovery of the oasis). The dominant stake (seeking meaning) is reweighted, but the pressure is ambient rather than actively tightening. The carpenter's agency is clear in following the song, though the stakes feel more thematic than visceral, and the cost of the quest is implied but not sharply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty and hope in silence emerges organically from the imagery and events, resisting direct statement. The final image of the carousel horse offers a resonant, non-literal answer. It is slightly weakened by the carpenter's explicit wondering if the singer was imaginary, which edges toward stating the theme rather than trusting the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the Accumulative mode. The prose has a consistent, haunting perceptual signature. The single line of dialogue is effectively implied subtext. Purposeful elision (the singer's nature) is taught and pays off at closure, enriching the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. There is a minor instance of potential scaffold in "misting hush" being used three times, but it functions as a purposeful motif. The closing paragraphs are particularly strong, with clear propulsion and no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels fresh and specific, avoiding cliché. The abandoned circus train and the silent carpenter offer a non-obvious angle. The execution is highly competent, but the concept does not feel radically transformative or risk-taking enough to reach the highest echelon of originality for this competitive standard.</comment>
