<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("lucid unrest"). However, emotional embodiment could be slightly sharper in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The interlaced hush accumulates to a palpable presence, reconfiguring the spirits' state. Cost is legible in the restorer's "lucid unrest." Orientation is clear by ~120 words. One meaningful cadence shift is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly rendered and purposefully drive the atmosphere. The tapestry needle and net function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV's professional priorities, avoiding generic description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through the increasing density of silence. The cost is legible in the final "lucid unrest." One meaningful deepening (the accumulating hush reweighting the stake) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (silence, unraveling) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of peace through accumulated stillness. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and implication, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and concise with good rhythm, though minor repetitive phrasing ("accumulated silence") appears. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. No major figurative muddles or scaffolding issues, but a slight template cadence in describing silence prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of restoration, spirit work, and silence. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity without quirkiness. The concept commits fully to its implications, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
