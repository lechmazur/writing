<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique trait of seeing ghosts. Her skillfully observant nature drives concrete micro-choices, like analyzing dust patterns, revealing character under pressure. The final earned stasis—carrying stories as a "weightless burden"—is credible and rooted in prior causality, though the emotional cost could be more sharply embodied in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Earned Stasis under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with Ezra reconfigured by the uncovered stories. The cost is legible in the "weightless burden" she carries. Linkage is pattern-driven (dust analysis leading to logbook) rather than strict causality, which fits the lens, though the final beat lacks a decisive tactile cost to match the conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is a masterful micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Ezra's professional bias ("dust accumulation patterns"). The mainspring barrel and dust physically constrain discovery, and the environment evolves from eerie silence to resonant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (uncovering secrets) and escalate through a single meaningful deepening: dust analysis reveals the hidden logbook. Agency is demonstrated through Ezra's skilled observation, and the cost is conceptual (carrying stories). Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient, though the pressure lacks a tactile tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the exploration of forgotten places and stories, resisting moralizing. The final image of "cracks" and "hidden stories" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the concept of "weightless burden" is slightly over-echoed in the closing paragraphs, nearing thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, professional voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture ("casts the abandoned circus ticket office in a dim, eerie silence"). No dialogue is present, but internal narration is consistently filtered through Ezra's specific observational lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally crisp and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor flaw is the repetitive use of the phrase "weightless burden" in the final beats, which creates a slight echo and diminishes the conceptual impact. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of an elevator technician who sees ghosts to uncover secrets in abandoned places is highly original and feels inevitable. The specific choice of a circus and a horologist's tool provides a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar gothic tropes. The concept is fully committed to and executed with authenticity.</comment>
