<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elys's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion and a clear, consistent motivation rooted in past pain. The final choice to keep the invitation is a credible Earned Stasis, though the "keenly empathetic" trait is more stated than tested under pressure in a way that would elevate the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory detail and reflective deepening toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands on the page with a felt cost in the final realization, though the "within arm's reach of midnight" timeframe is not a persistent constraint that actively tightens tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail filtered through Elys's POV, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. However, while the setting provides context and mood, it does not actively constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a meaningful deepening as Elys's search and reflection change their knowledge and reweight the stakes. The cost of their prolonged isolation and the price of their newfound peace are legible, though the escalation is more internal than externally driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding wisdom in paradox emerges organically from the particulars of Elys's journey and the discovered text. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("truth is not in the answer, but in the question") that reweights the narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, consistent texture and rhythmic control. The narrative voice effectively filters the world through Elys's perceptive and introspective nature. Minor filter verbs ("Elys felt") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats but do not significantly harm voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a cluster of filter verbs ("Elys felt," "Elys knew") and a slightly elevated register in the peak realization beat that slightly clashes with the established contemplative tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a recluse in a hidden library exploring paradoxical wisdom feels organic and specific. The concept is executed with emotional honesty, though the core premise hews closely to a familiar introspective archetype without a significantly transformative or non-obvious angle.</comment>
