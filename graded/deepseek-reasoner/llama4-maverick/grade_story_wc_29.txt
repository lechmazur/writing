<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot forward. However, her internal state lacks contradiction; she is uniformly hopeful and competent without the blind spots or genuine struggle that would deepen her characterization, particularly under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds effectively through pattern recognition. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost of eternal vigilance. Orientation is immediate and the lens holds, though the cosmic tricksters remain an abstract opposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the radio console and charts effectively establishing atmosphere. However, the setting functions more as a mood-enhancing backdrop than an element that actively constrains choice or charges the final image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is smooth under the Accumulative lens, moving from monitoring to breakthrough to active interference. The dominant stake (cosmic balance) is clear and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution. A slightly more tangible cost to her action would have elevated the score further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between hope and cosmic chaos, avoiding direct moralizing. The final paragraphs, however, edge toward explicit thematic statement ("her true calling"), slightly undermining the earned resonance of the preceding action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, consistent texture that effectively blends the technical and the wondrous. The voice is confident and the perceptual signature is strong, though some phrases ("cautiously hopeful anticipation") are repeated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythmic control. Minor deductions for repetitive phrasing ("cautiously hopeful," "subsonic frequencies") and a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns in the concluding paragraphs, which creates a small loss of momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a celestial interpreter using radio astronomy to battle cosmic tricksters is a fresh, specific synthesis. The concept feels organic, though the execution leans on familiar archetypes (the determined protagonist against a vague cosmic force) without fully subverting them.</comment>
