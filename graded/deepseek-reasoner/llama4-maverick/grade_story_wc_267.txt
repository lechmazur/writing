<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the weight of their own unpardonable silence"). However, the final stance crystallization ("choice to remain silent") is more told than earned through a dramatized, contradictory micro-choice under pressure, lacking the simultaneous internal conflict required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost ("a choice to remain silent in the face of adversity"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through reflective density. A slight deduction for a minor orientation delay in clarifying the bellhop's purpose and the nature of the "order."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("cobalt fortress," "dusty spiral staircase"). The setting successfully establishes a potent atmosphere. However, it primarily functions as a mood piece; the environment does not sufficiently constrain a choice or actively pressure tactics to reach the highest band, remaining more backdrop than crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's reflective deepening under the Accumulative lens, leading to a stance crystallization. The cost of silence is made legible. The external pressure from the figure's appearance is a minor complicating event that adds texture but does not significantly tighten or narrow the protagonist's options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict of safety versus identity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "frostbitten hope" and the reconfigured value of silence, avoiding moralizing. The concept of cost is deeply integrated into the character's reflective journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose effectively reflects the bellhop's contemplative state. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "seraphically mundane," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's internal lexicon, creating a small tonal inconsistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor prose artifact is present: a paraphrase loop between "the cost of safety" and "the price that they had paid" in the reflective block, which slightly dulls momentum without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept of a "silent-choir bellhop" guarding a fortress during "nerve regeneration" is highly original and specific. The synthesis of these elements feels organic and fresh, creating a memorable and singular artistic stance that avoids cliché and template plotting.</comment>
