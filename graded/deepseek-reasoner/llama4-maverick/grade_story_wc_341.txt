<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a strong professional lens and embodied emotion. However, her emotional progression is smooth and rational; a lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a moment of peak pressure prevents a higher score. The final renunciation is credible but could be more sharply earned by on-page irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the page with felt cost ("her heart swelled with emotion"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through reflection and imagery. A slight ambiguity in whether the final clarity is driven by agency or accumulation caps the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Lyra's professional POV. The sky gondola and brass telescope are well-anchored. The score is capped as the environment, while atmospheric, does not sufficiently constrain a choice; it is more a backdrop than a crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake (seeking meaning in chaos). The cost of her dedication is legible. The escalation is more reflective than agential, fitting the lens but limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of the core concepts (spooled wholeness, empty spaces remember) with Lyra's actions and the storm's memorialization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A minor deduction for the slightly overt echo of the prompt terms in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with "dusty starlight tone," which feels slightly more narrated than embodied, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting is present, including a template cadence with repeated "As she..." sentence stems and a near-paraphrase loop between "spooled wholeness" and "fragments... coming together." This slightly dulls the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of a meteorologist categorizing clouds by emotion is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The execution is specific and grounded in character. The score is limited as the core premise, while engaging, does not feel fully transformative or risk-taking in its resolution.</comment>
