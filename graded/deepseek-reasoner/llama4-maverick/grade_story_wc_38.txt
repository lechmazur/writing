<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aria's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and clear motivation, though the "explains through dance" trait is more ornamental than a genuine constraint on her choices, slightly limiting the depth of her struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aria's internal shift from defiance to liberation is felt. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building patterns (dice, web, journal) to reweight the final image. The cost of her transformation is legible in her renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures Aria and supplies key resources. The spider's web is an indispensable, recurring object that charges the final image by mirroring her coded thoughts and tightening the timeframe for escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the spider's web, which reweights the dominant stake (escape) and forces a stance crystallization. Aria's agency in encoding her final journal entry is the decisive act that forecloses her old path with a visible cost of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of vulnerability and strength, coded language, and liberation. The final image of the completed web offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of internal transformation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical, accumulative voice is distinct and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose effectively mirrors Aria's coded thought processes. Purposeful elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure, maintaining legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for some repetitive phrasing ("sense of...") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken lab, a codebreaker, and hangman's dice feels fresh and specific. The core concept of "calm defiance" is transformed through grounded choices in character and setting, though the "dance" trait is underutilized.</comment>
