<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a defiance against historical erasure. However, her "carefully resourceful" trait is stated rather than dramatized through on-page trade-offs or constraints; the key is a symbol, not a tool she uses tactically. Her internal state is conveyed with effective lyricism, but the lack of a contradictory impulse acting in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through dense imagery and motif. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the rebels' resolve with the cost of their ongoing struggle felt in the final image. The lens holds, though the linkage between beats is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is a vividly rendered, purposeful setting that establishes a strong atmosphere. However, it functions primarily as a backdrop and fails to actively pressure choices, supply resources, or alter tactics, preventing a score in the highest band. The description is woven beautifully into the narrative but lacks constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (resisting indifference) is clear, but escalation is weak. Pressure accumulates texturally through the gathering's energy rather than through a meaningful tightening of options or a consequential choice by Aria. The cost of the mission is declared but not made viscerally felt or tested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the integration of concept (revised histories), object (key), and setting. The final image of the lagoon as a "beacon of hope" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving memory. It avoids moralizing, though the thematic language occasionally nears declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is confident and consistent, effectively filtering the world through Aria's perspective. Some phrases verge on the ornate ("coded freedom," "tyranny of indifference"), creating minor register drift, but the control is largely maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic flow. However, minor overwriting is present, with some stacked modifiers ("peculiar object," "otherworldly glow") and a tendency toward abstract thematic language that slightly blurs immediacy in peak beats, though it doesn't break clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a rebel, a symbolic relic, and a fight against historical erasure feels organic. The auric lagoon is a fresh inflection. The story's strength lies in its specific synthesis of these elements rather than in groundbreaking plot turns, making it strong and cohesive but not exceptionally ingenious.</comment>
