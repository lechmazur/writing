<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a shiver run down her spine"). Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her meticulous survey. The final choice (determination to uncover the truth) is a credible Earned Stasis, though the internal contradiction between hazy thoughts and precision could be more dynamically shown in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds: her investigation proceeds via logical, motivated steps. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the weight of the secrets and her determination to learn the lessons. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words. One meaningful tightening occurs as her survey reveals the wind's complex patterns, changing her knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. The labyrinth of containers directly pressures her investigation and shapes the wind patterns she documents. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("smell of rust and saltwater," "creaking of the containers"). The environment evolves from intimidating to understood, mirroring her internal arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: her decision to survey the area is the key tightening that narrows options and changes knowledge. The cost is the mental burden of complexity and the weight of responsibility, felt in the final paragraphs. The dominant stake (understanding the crash to prevent future disasters) is clear and maintained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (the pursuit of foresight through meticulous analysis) emerges organically from events and the final image, resisting direct statement. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the "hazy precision" of her thoughts as a guiding force. The patch functions as a meaningful motif, though its thematic charge could be slightly more integrated into the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on professional observation. The prose has a controlled, purposeful texture. The "hazy precision" tonal concept is coherent and modulates effectively, becoming a guiding force by the end. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere effectively. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting the investigative pace. A minor instance of near-synonym use ("converge in a singular convergence") is a slight artifact but does not harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, grounded angle on an investigation trope through the specific lens of wind pattern analysis and a symbolic object. The combination of a physical labyrinth and a conceptual puzzle feels organic. The choice to end on Charged Poise rather than a full resolution is a credible risk that supports the theme.</comment>
