<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to make key on-page choices. However, interiority lacks contradiction; her "perpetually surprised" trait is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with a felt cost of connection. A minor orientation debt exists as the "pilgrim" is never anchored, creating a slight break in the opening's causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, weaving atmosphere through action. The observatory setting supplies the crucial resource (the star map carvings) that enables Lena's discovery, directly shaping the outcome and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly through Lena's agency as she deciphers the carvings and locates the chip, narrowing her options. The cost is the time and focused effort invested, though the final stake reconfiguration is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of the "frequency of belonging" concept with Lena's concrete discovery. The final realization that it is a "sense of connection" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior search.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. However, occasional register drift into elevated diction ("kaleidoscope of hues," "celestial ballet") slightly clashes with the POV's professional lexicon in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive. Deduction applied for moderate overwriting: a pattern of dense figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "stars beginning to twinkle like diamonds") creates minor texture without advancing pressure or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient astronomy and modern drone tech feels organic and serves the character's goal. The concept is fresh, though the archetype of a seeker decoding ancient secrets is familiar, limiting the score to the high end of strong.</comment>
