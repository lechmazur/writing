<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in a consistent artistic temperament. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though emotional embodiment could be sharper under peak pressure. The final endurance and renunciation feel earned, with a visible cost in her altered perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear before/after shift in Aria's purpose. The cost, while conceptual, is legible in the final image of her clarified vision. The journey's causality is tight, though the discovery of the chamber feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, creating a potent atmosphere. The toxic sky and decaying infrastructure are well-integrated filters for the POV. However, the environment does not sufficiently constrain choices or charge the final image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (quest for truth) tightens meaningfully. The cost of the journey is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of candor and is resolved through the resonant final image of the repository. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. The integration is specific and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the emotional arc. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Diction remains within the character's plausible lexicon, and the voice is compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and generally propulsive, with high information density. Minor instances of slightly elevated diction ("poignant reminder," "transience and beauty") create small register drifts in peak beats, slightly dulling the closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of dystopian decay and intimate artistic pursuit. The combination of a calligrapher whose ink wilts near dishonesty in a toxic city feels organic and singular. The risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure pays off.</comment>
