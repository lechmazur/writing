<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks the contradictory impulses or internal conflict that would elevate this to a higher band. Her attunement to the universe is a singular, unwavering trait, making her final liberation feel slightly unearned rather than hard-won through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost—the weight of her task lifting. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently through increasing sensory and emotional density that culminates in a decisive internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Description is vivid and purposeful, but the aurora-lit archway and astrolabe, while evocative, function more as a stage and prop than as elements that actively constrain her choices or charge the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the intensifying aurora and the dreamer's deepening focus, a textural pressure consistent with the lens. However, the cost of her quest—the accumulated time and devotion—is implied rather than made visible or felt on the page through a concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of creativity unlocked through cosmic connection is fully integrated and resolved through a resonant, non-literal image—the "trail of glittering stardust." It emerges organically from the particulars of the ritual without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose effectively modulates to match the ethereal tone and the character's heightened state of awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but exhibits minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "shadowed rapture that filled the archway, a mix of darkness and light that was both captivating and unnerving"). This slightly muddles clarity without serving a clear pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of cosmic wonder and personal creative block feels organic. The execution is strong and specific, though the core concept of stargazing for inspiration is a familiar trope that is executed well rather than fundamentally transformed.</comment>
