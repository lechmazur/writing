<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dresser’s motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance is earned, though the internal contradiction could be more dramatized in-scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, building to a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost in the final image of the polished marbles and flourishing garden. The pattern is taught early and pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden maze is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception and the story's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the dresser's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening through the ritual of polishing. The cost of devotion is legible, though the external pressure from "measurable luck" remains more stated than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central relationship between dresser and garden, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The final image of the marbles reweights prior material with profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, poetic perceptual signature. The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though occasional elevated diction slightly drifts from the character's likely lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor instances of synonym churn ("bittersweet aroma... comforting") and a template cadence in the final paragraphs prevent a higher score, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a quantifiable world with a deeply personal, spiritual connection to nature is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity and emotional truth.</comment>
