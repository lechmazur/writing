<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied, particularly in the handling of grief. However, the characterization lacks a moment of on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held through a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with the crane's release, but the causal linkages between elements (basilica, shadow, grief) are more thematic than driven by because/therefore logic, creating a slight ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden and the glass basilica are not just decorative; they actively charge the final image and constrain the character's longing and perspective, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement for setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase centered on grief. However, the pressure feels more meditative than actively tightening, lacking a clear, agency-driven turn that narrows options or changes knowledge on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into art emerges organically through concrete action and image (lanterns, cranes). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the conceptual repricing could be slightly sharper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction expertly modulate with emotional intensity, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, but slight overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats (e.g., "luminous torment that drove him to create, to shape, and to mold."). A minor deduction for figurative density that slightly blurs momentum, though clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a craftsperson's grief in a fantastical setting feels fresh and specific. The core concept is transformed through grounded, character-driven particulars, though the potential of certain elements (dream recording) is not fully realized to reach the highest band.</comment>
