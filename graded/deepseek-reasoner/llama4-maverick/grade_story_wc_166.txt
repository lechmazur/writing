<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the tactile connection to the moonstone and the unselfconscious dance. The final renunciation of exile feels earned by the prior causality of her artistic struggle. A minor deduction for the phrase "inexplicable connection," which leans toward diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the cosmic verse is etched on her skin, reconfiguring her purpose with a felt cost of exile lifting. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and cadence shifts toward the dance's crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The twilight garden and moonstone are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action (e.g., "feet bare and her toes curled over the edge of a weathered stone"). The environment actively guides her transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to "fledge" and dance intensifies the stakes. The cost is legible in the etching on her skin and the lifting of exile. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fusion of art and cosmos, resisting moralizing. The final image of the verse etched on skin offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of capturing transcendence, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("obsidian grace") that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression in the dance sequence maintains momentum. No dialogue present, so evaluated solely on internal voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion. Minor register drift in "obsidian grace" feels slightly elevated for the POV but is consistent with the voice. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tide dancing, cosmic verse, and elective exile feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept commits fully to its premise, avoiding template plots.</comment>
