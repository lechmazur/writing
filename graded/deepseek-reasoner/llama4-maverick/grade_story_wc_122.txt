<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and her emotional progression from numbness to wonder is embodied and earned. Her deafness is integrated as a trait that shapes perception rather than a label. A slight deduction for a moment of abstract summary ("emotional numbness that had threatened to consume her") in an otherwise concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aria finds peace in the "mirrored hush," with cost legible in her foreclosed path to a conventional sonic world. The pattern of sensory and emotional accumulation is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern is indispensable, functioning as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Aria's quest. Its sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, charging the final image of peace. The "damp earth" and "woven mat" are tactile anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the accumulative lens, through her persistent experimentation. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) deepens via a cadence shift as her humming grows "more insistent," reweighting the emotional stakes with a clear cost—the renunciation of sound for vibrational feeling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central paradox of a deaf music teacher finding music in silence. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for feeling, reweighting "hush" as a lifeline rather than an absence. Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Aria's perceptual world. The voice is consistent, though a slight convergence in the description of the cavern's magic ("ancient, earthy") momentarily softens the distinctive filter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a paraphrasing loop: "a feeling that the world was full of hidden patterns" slightly restates the prior "sense of wonder." No artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of deafness, music, and silence. The specific perspective feels authentic and fully committed to its premise, transforming a potential trope into a singular artistic stance. High risk-taking that coheres.</comment>
