<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied emotion and a clear, motivating need to transmute pain. The final choice to create is earned by prior causality, though the "shyly unstoppable" trait feels more told than shown in action, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost (weight lifting, replaced by joy) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The galaxy postcard effectively seeds the final transformation, though the "blossom armistice" concept remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The shell and bioluminescent fungi create a vivid, atmospheric setting that mirrors the internal state. However, while the environment supports the mood, it does not sufficiently constrain a choice or actively pressure tactics, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—the decision to sing transforms her longing. The cost (centuries of vigil) is legible, though the pressure feels more internal than externally coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poet's act of creation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to transmuting sorrow into art. The final image of the postcard seared into her mind powerfully reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality. The prose effectively reflects the poet's mind, though occasional ornate phrasing ("reef-shadow joy") slightly distances the reader at peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor overwriting occurs in stacked metaphors ("galaxy postcard, once a simple reminder... became a catalyst"), creating slight density without full payoff, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements with high originality—a poet in a giant shell, a galactic postcard, and the concept of photosynthesizing pain feel fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded voice elevates the premise beyond mere novelty.</comment>
