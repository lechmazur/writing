<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in a desire to prevent imbalance, driving the protagonist's meditative actions. Interiority is concrete, though some phrasing ("terrestrially cosmic") edges toward abstraction. The final renunciation (releasing the wing) is earned by the prior effort, with a visible cost in expended energy. However, the emotional struggle lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density and pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with cost felt in the summoner's satisfaction and the transformed haven. The lens holds consistently, and the origami wing acts as a persistent constraint. A minor deduction for the prophecy's urgency feeling slightly abstract rather than a pressing, immediate threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly rendered and integral, pressuring the summoner's choice of method and supplying the water for the wing's release. The crane's origami wing functions as a micro-setting, constraining the action (as a focal point) and decisively charging the final image as it drifts away. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's meditative state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing the prophecy) is signaled early. Escalation is textural, achieved through the deepening meditative state and the thickening air, which narrows the summoner's focus to the single task. The cost is the energy poured into the work, felt as the night wears on. However, the pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric, lacking a more tangible, external tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of silence, balance, and proactive peacekeeping. The final image of the drifting wing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of combating imbalance. Subtext is rich in the method itself—mapping silence is the thematic argument. Avoids moralizing, with the concept fully integrated into the narrative's action and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersed in the summoner's perceptual field. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a rhythmic flow that mirrors the meditative state. There is no dialogue. Purposeful elision (the exact nature of the prophecy) is taught early and pays off by focusing the stakes on the act of hushing rather than the content.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts include the slightly redundant pairing "tranquil atmosphere that seemed to smooth the hush" and the awkward compound "terrestrially cosmic." These create small drags on momentum but do not muddy the core action or obscure the potent closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of "mapping silence" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of meditation and magic. The combination of a summoner using origami as a focus feels organic and singular. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that pays off in the resonant ending. The story fully commits to its lyrical, atmospheric premise.</comment>
