<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, tender persona. Their actions—untangling threads with "deliberate slowness"—reveal character under pressure. However, the final choice to continue the journey feels more like an epiphany than a decision earned by a visible, on-page cost, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the gardener's understanding reconfigures their world. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory details and pattern recognition. The cost, however, is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, as the final image of an "alive" world is declared rather than shown through a concrete, costly action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and its contents are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated. The setting actively pressures the choice to untangle the tapestry, and the final image of the starlit cemetery is charged by the discovery within the silo. The sensory details are selective and reflect the POV's priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification: the pattern in the tapestry is discerned, deepening the gardener's knowledge and connection to the echoes. This is a single, meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is the investment of time and focus, though it is more implied than starkly visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of seeking meaning in echoes emerges organically from the gardener's quest and the artifacts. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reconfiguring the mundane into the mystical. It avoids moralizing, though the concluding promise of a "journey that had just begun" edges toward declarative summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, measured rhythm that mirrors the gardener's meticulous nature. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a lens of tenderness and mystery. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of potential register drift exists in "velveteen gloom," which feels slightly ornamental, but it is a single phrase that does not harm clarity or momentum. Information density is high and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a cemetery gardener, a mystical silo, and uncharted echoes feels fresh and specific. The synthesis is organic and the perspective is memorable. The risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off, though the core concept of "echoes" remains slightly abstract.</comment>
