<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria's interiority is concrete and embodied, with a clear emotional progression from disconnection to wonder. The micro-choice to sketch is a strong, character-particular action that earns her final step forward. However, her "blessed pariah" status is more label than dramatized flaw, lacking contradictory impulses that complicate her choices on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost of her stretched existence, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The linkage from sketching to the compass rose aligning is a meaningful cadence shift. The faint light's introduction is slightly coincidental but complicates rather than resolves, serving the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observation deck is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aria's perception of decay and grandeur. The gilded compass rose applique constrains her focus and guides her path, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the Accumulative lens: her choice to sketch deepens her knowledge and reweights the stake from confusion to exploration. The cost of her temporally stretched existence is legible, narrowing her options and charging her final step. One meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of setting, object, and action, resisting moralizing. The final image of the compass rose guiding her offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of disconnection and purpose. The sketching custom provides a concrete particular that grounds the thematic movement from past to future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Aria's perception, with a distinct textual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with her emotional state, from stillness to possibility. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived. The lyrical, accumulative mode is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("stars twinkling like diamonds") is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift were detected. The sentence-level propulsion expertly mirrors the narrative's shift from stillness to movement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a time dilation deck is a fresh angle, synthesized effectively with the character's personal ritual. The combination feels organic, not checklist-driven. However, the "blessed pariah" concept and the faint light feel slightly under-transformed from potential tropes, holding it back from the highest band.</comment>
