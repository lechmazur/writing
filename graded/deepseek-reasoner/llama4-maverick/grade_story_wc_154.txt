<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with credible emotional progression under anesthetic haze. The final renunciation of anxiety is earned by the decryption work, though the "lotus-hearted ache" label feels slightly diagnostic at the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kael's internal shift reconfigures her relationship to past trauma. The accumulative lens holds, building through the coral and cast to a final image of peace with visible cost in the lingering ache.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are vividly rendered and purposefully filter perception. The coral charges the final image, though the setting's pressure on choice is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's active decryption of the cast, a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and reweights her internal stake. The cost is legible in the ache that persists even after her shift to peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of coral, cast, and memory, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer about fragile beauty emerging from turmoil without stating it outright.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, translator's eye for patterns. Some register drift occurs near the end ("lotus-hearted"), slightly softening the voice's precision at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor synonym churn ("unknot the tangled threads... slowly unraveling") and a stacked modifier ("lotus-hearted ache") that slightly muddles the peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conflict-zone translator, brain coral, and a child's cast feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and object create a singular and memorable perspective on healing.</comment>
