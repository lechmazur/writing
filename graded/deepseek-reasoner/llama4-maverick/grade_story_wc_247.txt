<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The advisor's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistently drives their actions, with embodied emotion in micro-choices like deciphering the sign language tale. The old man's joyful sorrow adds depth, and their bond feels authentic. However, the advisor's internal contradictions under pressure are not fully dramatized, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an accumulative/textural lens, with the harbor's transformation and the camera's symbolic capture providing felt cost. The lens holds, but the cost, while present, is more conceptual than visceral, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and vintage camera are integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "gentle lapping of waves" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the advisor's perception, with coherent spatial choreography and atmospheric evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the advisor's agency under the accumulative lens, with silence mapping intensifying into music creation, narrowing options and reweighting stakes. The cost is legible in the "joyful sorrow" and the old man's gratitude, though the pressure remains gentle rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the translation of silence into music and the camera's symbolism, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and connection, with subtext in gestures and imagery, though the "joyful sorrow" tone leans slightly toward declared emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with lyrical rhythm ("luminous harbor by moonlight"). Sign language functions as action with subtext, and prose reflects the advisor's perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register drift, though dialogue is minimal and stylized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language ("symphony of silence") is purposeful and coherent, without artifacts or loops. Read-aloud flow is strong, and momentum is maintained through concise, image-driven lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of translating silence into music via sign language is fresh and specific, synthesized with the camera motif. Emotional truth anchors the premise, and the closure feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation pays off without gimmickry, though it echoes familiar themes of memory.</comment>
