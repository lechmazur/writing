<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation rooted in observation and a desire for change. Embodied emotion is present ("surge of determination," "thrill of excitement"), but interior contradiction is underdeveloped. The final choice feels earned by prior causality, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and cadence shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with the viaduct's crescendo, reconfiguring meaning. However, the cost is conceptual ("nothing would ever be the same") rather than felt through a specific, on-page price, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional, purposeful sensory detail. The magnetic viaduct and frozen lake are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. The environment is fully integrated into the action and the protagonist's perception, with a coherent sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure building through environmental intensity and her focused observation. The dominant stake (revolution) is clear. However, the cost of the action remains abstract; a more concrete, on-page price would strengthen the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of a "patient revolution" emerges organically from the character's actions and the setting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the glowing lake. It avoids moralizing, though the concept could be more deeply conflicted within the character's choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stable, distinct POV with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates with the rising tension. Diction remains within the character's plausible lexicon, and the lyrical descriptions feel voice-motivated and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor scaffold is present in a few adjacent sentences ("The mapper knew... The mapper felt...") but does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mapping, a frozen landscape, and a metallic viaduct creates a fresh, memorable atmosphere. The core concept of a "patient revolution" is a non-obvious angle on rebellion. The execution is specific and grounded, though the central conceit feels more atmospheric than narratively transformative.</comment>
