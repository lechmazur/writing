<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and deepens credibly; her epiphany feels earned through specific sensory details and micro-choices. However, the moment of resurfacing motivation ("to honor these forgotten tales") is slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized with embodied contradiction, holding it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through density of revelation (lens → painting → realization). Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the "vibrating" anchors and reconfigured cityscape. The lens holds, though the cost at the very end is slightly more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The market is vividly rendered and sensorily rich, acting as a crucible for discovery. The lighthouse lens fragment qualifies as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and directly enables Lena's key choices, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively under the Accumulative lens through a series of discoveries (purchase, painting, realization). The dominant stake (unlocking hidden histories) is tested and deepened by Lena's agency. The cost is conceptually clear but could be more viscerally immediate in the closing beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of object, setting, and character. The final image of the city as a "canvas" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of honoring the overlooked, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure. The prose possesses a strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant") that is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but minor artifacts appear. The phrase "elusively tangible" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. There is also a register drift in "afire with the eternal instant," which feels elevated compared to the surrounding text, slightly dulling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept synthesizes familiar elements (magical market, mystical object) into a fresh, specific vision through the unique role of the translator and the "anchors of intuition." The risk-taking in the accumulative, revelatory structure pays off with coherence.</comment>
