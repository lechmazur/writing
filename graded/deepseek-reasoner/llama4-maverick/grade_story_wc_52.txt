<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the wood and the tea ritual. The final choice to endure is earned by the meditative process, though the motivation to "contain" emotion is slightly more told than shown in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the completed carving and the empty kettle makes the cost of "here and gone" legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skylight loft and the ash wood blank are not just described but function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and perfectly filtered through the widow's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of grief and the meditative process, which deepens and tightens the emotional stakes. A single meaningful cadence shift occurs as the carving is completed, reweighting the dominant stake with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "here and gone" is integrated through specific events and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for the slightly explicit articulation of the concept and "harvesting lessons" in the text, which trends toward summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture and rhythmic quality that reflects the widow's meditative state. The voice is consistent and the perceptual signature is strong throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lucid, precise, and possesses a read-aloud quality with varied syntax. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold to detract from the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a lion tamer's widow and woodcarving is fresh and specific. The execution is organic, though the core emotional arc of processing grief through craft, while well-executed, is a familiar premise.</comment>
