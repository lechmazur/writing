<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("clutched," "traced"). The final realization feels earned by the on-page action of examining the tickets and lens, though the cost of her past secrecy is more told than shown, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image reweights the lens's meaning. The pattern of sensory and object details accumulates toward a decisive internal shift with a legible, felt cost in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("scent of wet stone," "crystal structures"). The forecourt and the lens function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though the lens's constraint on choice is more potential than realized, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift driven by the protagonist's agency in deciphering the doodles and using the lens. The stake (thawing mistrust) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of her past burden is felt, though its legibility is slightly softened by summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of the lens, tickets, and setting. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of honesty. A slight tendency toward thematic statement ("freed by honesty") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. However, some repetitive sentence stems ("The registrar...") and a occasional drift into summary phrasing create minor artifacts that slightly dull the voice's distinctiveness under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "freed by honesty" / "thaw mistrust with transparency") and a template cadence in several sentences starting with "The registrar," which slightly reduces momentum and information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a crystal forecourt, projector lens, and cryptic ticket doodles creates a fresh, memorable synthesis. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices, though the overall effect feels slightly familiar within the introspective, lyrical mode.</comment>
