<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her profession and curiosity. Her micro-choices, like retrieving the arrow tip, reveal character under pressure. The final awe and resolve feel earned, though the emotional transition from discovery to departure could be slightly more embodied to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the plot progresses logically from mission to discovery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lyra's understanding is decisively changed, with a felt cost in her reluctant departure from the echoes. The linkage is strong, though the arrow tip's introduction feels slightly convenient as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices; the floating arches and inverted gravity are integral to navigation and the core discovery. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Lyra's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (discovering resilience's source) and escalate through Lyra's agency as she follows the amplified growth trail. The cost is legible in the foreclosed path of leaving the profound discovery, though the pressure could tighten more acutely under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the discovery of the echoes as a source of resilience, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the whirling silence, though the connection between the arrow tip and the thematic core remains slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, professional filter. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with the wonder of the discovery. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("whirling silence") is effective and consistent. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the pool's effect, but it does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of an orchard planet with inverted gravity and a gathering of echoes feels fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and explored, resulting in a singular artistic stance that synthesizes familiar elements into a non-obvious whole.</comment>
