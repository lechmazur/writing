<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (picking up the bowl, joining the circle). The final choice to play is motivated by the witnessed connection. However, explicit internal conflict is muted; her contradictory impulses are more told than shown in simultaneous action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the chronic hush being "tempered" but not erased, a legible cost. The linkage from observation to participation is coherent. The lens holds from the opening sensory accumulation through to the final, reweighted image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV. The greenhouse and bonfire constrain choice by providing the setting for the climax. The shipwrecks, however, are ornamental and do not pressure choices, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency: her decision to approach, enter, and finally play her violin. This action constitutes a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake (finding beauty/connection) with a clear, felt cost—the unbinding of sorrow and the transformation of the hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between desolation and connection, the unfinished and the beautiful. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the tempered hush, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The mute bowl is a potent thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the Accumulative/Textural mode. The perceptual signature is consistent, with a controlled, poetic rhythm that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the violinist's acoustically perceptive nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat: "a poignant harmony that filled the greenhouse" feels slightly summary-like compared to the more embodied descriptions surrounding it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, musicality, and thematic pursuit of wabi-sabi beauty is fresh and specific. The core concept of an "echo-harbor violinist" is a singular, memorable inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight and fully commits to its premise.</comment>
