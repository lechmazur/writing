<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seed sorter's curiosity and dedication are clear and consistent, compelling her to decode the leaves. However, her transformation is more declared ("she felt herself emerging transformed") than dramatized through embodied contradiction or a costly micro-choice. The final realization of the prophecy is an epiphany, but the cost of this change is not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural drive lens is successfully inferred and held; pressure builds through pattern recognition. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the decoded prophecy reconfigures her future. A cost is legible in the line "the hush... was a fragile, fleeting thing," though it is more conceptual than viscerally felt, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's choices. The moonstone speck and the falling leaves are not just decorative; they are integral resources she must handle and decode, directly charging the final prophetic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding the message) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—her prodding of the speck and building of monuments deepen her knowledge. However, the pressure remains gentle and the cost of her transformation is soft, more a promise of future change than a tangible price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through attentive listening emerges organically from the decoded leaves and the protagonist's actions. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A minor deduction for the slightly overt declaration of theme in "a new sense of purpose."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that filters the world through the character's wonder. The voice is consistent, though occasionally the poetic density ("mossy delight") borders on overwriting without harming clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is dense throughout, and there is some synonym churn (e.g., "mystical, otherworldly place"). These artifacts are present but do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a seed sorter decoding prophecies in a skyborne arbor is a fresh and specific synthesis. The execution is confident and the voice distinctive. It is elevated by its particularity, though the arc of personal transformation is a more familiar element executed well.</comment>
