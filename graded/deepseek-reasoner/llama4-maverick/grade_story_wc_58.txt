<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The POV's melancholic, writerly interiority is concrete and well-embodied, particularly in the tactile interaction with the carpet thread. The final choice to write is motivated, but the felt cost of this renunciation or its impact on a foreclosed path is not sharply defined on the page, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), achieved through the accumulative/textural lens as the descriptive density culminates in a transformed perception of the silence. The cost of this understanding is legible but slightly muted, and the lens, while coherent, could be more tightly held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, masterfully establishing the autumnal garden's morbid atmosphere. The palace carpet thread functions as a micro-setting, though its constraint on choice is more symbolic than tactical, preventing a top-score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift into writing, which reweights the dominant stake of connection. The pressure is coherent and the protagonist's agency is clear, but the cost of this action remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of absence, memory, and connection, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the phrase "bittersweet reminder" verges on stating the theme, slightly diminishing its power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, writerly signature. The prose rhythm is generally controlled, though a slight over-reliance on adjective-noun pairs ("unsettling stillness," "mournful sigh") creates minor template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor line-level artifacts. A paraphrase loop occurs ("a sense of understanding wash over me, a comprehension"), and a filter verb stack ("I began to ponder," "I felt compelled," "I hoped to conjure") clusters in a key beat, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core premise of writing obituaries for the living is a fresh, poignant angle on themes of memory. The synthesis of elements feels organic, though the execution, while strong, does not achieve the level of transformative risk-taking required for the highest echelon.</comment>
