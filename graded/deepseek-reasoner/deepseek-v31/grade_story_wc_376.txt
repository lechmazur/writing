<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent and unique trait (wilting near lies), and compels her high-stakes journey. Her final choice to return and share the truth is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The physical embodiment of her emotional state under pressure is specific and avoids diagnostic language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost: Elara's choice to return and face the city's dishonesty. The causal lens holds: her discovery of the map leads logically to her journey and the spring's revelation. The final beat ("she grew") is a legible cost-proof of her transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that pressures choice, from the toxic sky to the root-system tunnels. The environment consistently constrains tactics and charges the final image; the spring is the literal and thematic source of the city's life. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's professional and physical state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: her decision to follow the map tightens options and raises the physical cost of her journey. The dominant stake (finding truth/water) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens upon discovering the spring. The cost of her physical wilting is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (candor), setting (drought), and character (wilting). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the city starves for truth, not water. The final image of drinking from the spring of unfiltered voice reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elara's calligraphy profession. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue from the plumber is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("a waterfall of whispered conversations") is purposeful and clear. There are no observable loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise—a calligrapher who wilts near lies seeking a reservoir of lost words—is a fresh, specific synthesis. The combination of elements feels organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
