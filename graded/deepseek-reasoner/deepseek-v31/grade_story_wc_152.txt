<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is precise and layered, with her disguised wisdom and strategic mind revealed through micro-choices under pressure. Her internal contradiction—official duty versus real work—acts simultaneously in scene. Prince Kaelen's shift from arrogance to understanding is earned through her guidance, and his final choice is motivated by her causal influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; Elara's strategic choice to guide rather than give the chart directly leads to Kaelen's purposeful exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara continues stitching, her cost felt in the echoed silence and ongoing burden. Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory and eternal candle are not just decorative; they constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (scent of decay, dancing shadows) are filtered through Elara's professional POV and intensify the waiting silence. The candle's light is crucial for revealing spectral threads, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens; her strategic guidance tightens Kaelen's options, forcing a trade-off between direct confrontation and subtle disruption. The cost is legible in her continued isolation and the weight of the unsaid. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge and power in subtlety emerges organically through action and image, not statement. The final image of Elara stitching the truth offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to fight conspiracy. Subtext operates powerfully in her dialogue with Kaelen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elara's perceptual signature evident in her selective, professional noticing. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("whispered between the stars") is purposeful and enhances clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure cause/effect or the closure image. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial embroidery and political intrigue is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high originality, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
