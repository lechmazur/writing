<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sparrow's characterization is exceptionally embodied through professional details (stained fingers, kerosene rag) and micro-choices under pressure. His internal contradiction—filtering despair through disciplined awareness—fuels his final act, which lands with visible cost as he leaves the changed silence behind. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern repetition until the mosaic's discovery pivots the action. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as people rise, with cost felt in their altered postures and the "brighter silence." The mosaic's command pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The "blooming fortress," starless night, and courtyard dust all pressure Sparrow's choices. The mosaic itself constrains and charges the finale, while sensory hierarchy (pungent kerosene, hissing fuses) reflects his professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density—the weight of silence, discovered mosaic, and fiery reply—all driven by Sparrow's agency. His choice to answer the command with fireworks narrows options to a single, costly act. The felt price is the people's risen but burdened posture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mosaic's command and Sparrow's fiery reply, avoiding moralizing. The final image of people rising offers a resonant, non-literal answer to hopelessness. Subtext operates in gestures (bowed heads, upturned faces) and the charged reprise of "RISE."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, professional cadence ("filter the pervasive despair from his own mind"). POV remains tightly bound to Sparrow's perception. The chemical chant and kerosene-as-ink metaphor are voice-motivated and heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor deduction for slight repetitive phrasing in peak beats ("not just lighting fuses... not just noise"). However, rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the action, and closure image remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pyrotechnics and existential defiance feels fresh and inevitable. The mosaic as a command from the past is a non-obvious turn that transforms the premise. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off with coherence and stakes heightened throughout.</comment>
