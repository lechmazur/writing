<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's functionally creative trait is embodied through concrete micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a decisive change earned by prior causality. Her stoic wonder and professional focus create a coherent interiority. The final choice to resurrect the station feels inevitable given her established motivation and problem-solving approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive physical change with clear cost (energy expenditure, structural risk) that reconfigures the station's potential. The sextant's discovery and use create tight because/therefore linkages, and the final image of starlight pouring in charges the ending with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal functions as both setting and crucible, constraining choices and supplying key resources (capacitor banks). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional perspective. The sextant and hydraulic system are integral to the climax, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, moving from survey to discovery to active transformation. The dominant stake (finding hope/potential) tightens through each beat. Cost is legible in the groaning machinery and residual energy expenditure, altering the station's options irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing decay into hope emerges organically through the transformation of the station. The final image of starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The sextant's reweighting from artifact to key reinforces the thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's engineer perspective. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional dense metaphors ("tomb of discarded joy") slightly elevate register. Perceptual signature is distinct and maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("maze of intentions") that slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence-level propulsion generally supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering precision with poetic sensibility. The concept of a "maze of intentions" transformed through "redirected flows" feels organic and inevitable. Specific, verifiable detail (sextant, hydraulic systems, capacitors) creates authenticity without quirkiness.</comment>
