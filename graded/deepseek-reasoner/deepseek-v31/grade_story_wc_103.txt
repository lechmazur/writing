<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma, and intensifies believably. Her internal conflict is shown through the haunting memory loop, and her final choice is earned by her analytical breakthrough. The embodied emotion is strong, though a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("she understood now") slightly abstracts a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive, on-page change (mother's return) with clear cost (photographs disintegrate). The orientation is immediate, and the linkage from discovery to understanding to action is tight and motivated by because/therefore logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not merely described; it is the laboratory that constrains and enables the central choice. The halo fragment, a key object, charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the protagonist's perception and goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly from discovery to revelation to climactic action. The dominant stake (finding her mother) is tested and narrowed through each beat. The cost of the faded photographs is a legible price paid for the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (time's texture), character (memory trap), and image (maze as map). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of feeling time's grain is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice suited to the character. The prose has a distinct texture, though occasional dense figurative language ("quaking reverie") creates minor opacity. Dialogue is brief but functional and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the grain of years") which creates a small density artifact, and a near-paraphrase loop ("unpick that stitch... disintegrate the knot").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge maze design, temporal physics, and personal trauma is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high conceptual integrity, transforming its components into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
