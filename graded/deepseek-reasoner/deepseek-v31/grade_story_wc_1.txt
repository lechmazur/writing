<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s characterization is strong, with her artist background and adaptive survivalism grounding her final, decisive choice to broadcast the truth. Her motivation evolves credibly from granular survival to a "loud" purpose, though the shift from personal to global stakes feels slightly abrupt, held back from a higher score by a minor lack of contradiction in the transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot operates on a clear causal lens: the ledger discovery motivates the climb, which reveals the message and reconfigures her purpose. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost in the arduous climb and the weight of the new mission. The single, meaningful tightening is perfectly scaled to the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon setting is not just atmospheric but actively pressures and enables Lyra's choices, from offering silence for reflection to providing the physical challenge of the climb. The ledger itself functions as a micro-setting, its secrets drawn out by the frost, constraining her investigation and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the causal lens from personal survival to global salvation. Lyra’s agency drives every turn: finding the ledger, deciphering it, and undertaking the climb. The cost is legible in her body’s protest and the immense weight of the truth she uncovers, making the escalation feel earned and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from the fusion of image and action: the "scorched testament" is both literal object and thematic anchor for rebirth from destruction. The final image of using "light, of glass" to make poison "luminous" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights her entire journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature firmly anchored in Lyra’s artist-turned-survivor perspective. Sentences are controlled and purposeful, with rhythm modulating to match contemplation and physical strain. No head-hopping or voice leakage; the POV is stable and deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in phrases like "granular: to discover purpose in the pauses between one breath and the next," which momentarily slows momentum. Otherwise, prose is propulsive and artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glass artist, a charcoal ledger, and ecological conspiracy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "scorched testament" is ingeniously deployed as both plot device and thematic core. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
