<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelin's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, from her "calibrated instrument of a heart" to the "haunted euphoria" she experiences. Her professional meticulousness ("gently thorough") and emotional vulnerability are contradictory impulses that act simultaneously, making her final choice to hand over the locket feel earned and resonant. The micro-choice of the silent offering is a perfect hierarchy-of-values reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is impeccably held: her archival mission leads to the locket, whose data reveals the story, which is then directly delivered to its subject. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, the past flooding into the present, with undeniable cost and renewal legible in the final image of the "weight... finally delivered." The son's arrival is the perfect, inevitable therefore.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty" is far from ornamental; its bioluminescence provides the light by which she works and charges the final image. The walnut ink and archival tools are micro-settings that constrain her actions with tangible cost. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled immediately ("weight you carry") and escalate beautifully from preserving a memory to delivering it directly to its living recipient. The pressure tightens causally with each discovery, culminating in the son's arrival, which forces the ultimate, high-agency choice. The cost of this emotional delivery is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory, weight, and covenant is woven perfectly through the particulars of the locket, the voice log, and the final encounter. It offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central question: preservation is an act of love and delivery, not a burden. The final image reweights everything that came before without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Kaelin's archivist sensibility, with a distinct perceptual signature ("planetoid of grief and love"). The prose is rhythmic and controlled, modulating perfectly with emotional pressure. The single line of dialogue from the son is natural and goal-driven, distinct from the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. There is a single, minor register drift in "planetoid of grief and love," which slightly elevates diction beyond the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and immersive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of an archivist preserving "the weight of small moments" is fresh and brilliantly executed. The combination of sci-fi setting with a deeply human, emotional core feels organic and inevitable. The final turn, with the son arriving, is a masterstroke of ingenuity that transforms the story from a recovery mission into a delivery.</comment>
