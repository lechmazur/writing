<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, specific, and compelling, rooted in a "quiet, desperate need." Her professional competence is balanced with a genuine, non-profit-driven struggle. The final beat of exposing the truth feels earned. However, her emotional state remains largely singular (focused determination) under pressure, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot coheres through the layering of dream fragments toward a decisive conceptual repricing of the disaster's cause. The closure lands on the page with clear cost: "silencing the Purser’s lie that had poisoned the collective memory of the dead." Orientation is immediate and the taught pattern of harvesting dreams pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacial shrine is not merely atmospheric; it actively constrains and charges the work, its "borrowed starlight" and "frigid and still" air reflecting the character's focus and the nature of her cold, precise truth-seeking. The melted snow globe is the ultimate example of a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (salvaging a pure truth) is signaled early. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift—the moment she "found the window" in the Reykjavik dream—that reweights the stake and definitively narrows the mystery. The cost is the horrific truth itself, legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus corrupted memory emerges organically from the core concept and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the distorted snow globe reflecting candlelight, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The pursuit of "one untainted truth" is the thematic engine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, poetic, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("the compressed light of centuries," "psychic shrapnel"). The POV is stable and the prose's rhythm modulates effectively with the intensity of the revelation. Purposeful compression is used to great effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished, vivid, and dense with purpose. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("whisperer to the dead," "steel graves," "cacophony of final regrets") which, while beautiful, borders on a pattern that is slightly more decorative than functional in that specific beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wreck-diver, ghost-whisperer, and dream analyst is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core concept is a fresh, non-obvious angle on supernatural investigation. The story commits fully to its singular premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
