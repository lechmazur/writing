<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her to guide Leo through embodied, contradictory struggle. Her final bittersweet peace is earned by the causality of the choir's achieved harmony, with visible cost in the program's end. Leo's transformation from defensive isolation to blended offering is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of subtraction builds density toward a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with cost ("the program would vanish") and the final image of "resonant silence" reweights prior material. The zither's rosette metaphor taught early pays off in Leo's breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light are purposefully selective, filtered through Eliza's professional bias. The zither functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (Eliza uses it to teach Leo) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is woven into action, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (program cancellation) signals early. Escalation is driven by Eliza's agency under accumulative lens: her method of subtracting noise deepens pressure through repeated rehearsal. Cost is legible in Leo's struggle and the program's end. One meaningful cadence shift (harmony achieved) reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of subtraction emerges organically from events and metaphors (rosette, silence). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: harmony through loss. Subtext operates in gesture and image ("voice emerged not as a declaration, but as an offering"). Resists tidy moralizing, embracing bittersweet complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature ("traveled stillness"). Prose reflects Eliza's lyrical, professional mind. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Eliza's instructions to Leo). Purposeful compression ("unlearning hatred") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (rosette metaphor). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with rehearsal beats. Read-aloud quality is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of choir teaching and subtraction philosophy feels inevitable. Specific, grounded choices (zither, Leo's backstory) avoid tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
