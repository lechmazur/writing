<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Anya's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and a morally complex final choice that feels earned. Her motivation ("to thaw mistrust with transparency") evolves credibly into a higher-stakes decision for mercy, revealed through embodied micro-choices like the breath "that felt like her first" before burning the evidence. The contradiction between her duty to veracity and her choice of context over condemnation is dramatized in scene, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot operates on a clear Causal drive lens: the discovery of the logbook (therefore) leads to the revelation via the lens (therefore) forces the moral choice. Closure is a potent Earned Stasis—her refusal to log the truth forecloses a path with the visible cost of an incomplete record, landing with the resonant image of the archive's hush now feeling like "the peace of resolution." The cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, from the "climate-controlled vaults" to the "crystal whispering forecourt." The projector lens functions brilliantly as a micro-setting that constrains and enables the key revelation. It falls just short of the 9-band because the forecourt, while atmospheric, does not actively pressure her final choice; it serves as a backdrop for the action rather than a constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the Causal lens: the initial curiosity about a discrepancy tightens into the concrete discovery of condemning evidence, forcing a high-stakes ethical choice. The cost of her decision—destroying truth for mercy—is palpable and alters the final state of the archive and her role within it. The pressure coheres from a professional to a deeply personal dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from action and image, exploring the tension between factual truth and moral honesty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Anya's act, reweighting the meaning of the "distorted lens" and the archive's "veracity" without moralizing. The complexity is earned, embracing the ambiguity of choosing "context over condemnation."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, analytical texture fitting a registrar. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, maintaining its lyrical quality ("a mausoleum for whispers") while staying rooted in Anya's POV. The elision of how she precisely finds the logbook is purposeful, trusting the reader and maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple duties of character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "It was ambiguously clear" is slightly redundant, but it's a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or harm the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements with originality and authenticity. The concept of an archive of spoken words is fresh, and the use of a projector lens as a truth-revealing mechanism feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The moral calculus of the ending is a specific, non-obvious risk that heightens the stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
