<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's "logically emotional" trait is embodied through his felt connection to the lighthouse's pain and his shift from technical adjustment to empathetic listening. His final choice to harmonize rather than command is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic "temperamentally calibrated" phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (ice pacified) with a resonant reconfiguration (Kaelen's adapted worldview). The causal lens holds tightly: his failed technical attempt directly causes his shift to empathetic listening, which resolves the conflict. Cost is legible in the palpable tension of the shuddering tower and his moment of panic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image of calm. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's professional and urgent POV. The lighthouse itself functions as a crucial tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: his failed command causes the ice to resist violently, forcing a tactical shift. The cost of his initial failure is visceral and on-page. The dominant stake (protecting the artifact by pacifying the ice) is clear and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between logic and emotion, technical command and empathetic harmony. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of ice finding "quiet understanding." Avoids moralizing, achieving complexity through the fusion of engineering and emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Kaelen's engineering mindset. The prose's rhythm and diction effectively modulate with rising pressure. The single minor flaw is the slightly jarring register of "fleshly ethereal" at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control and sensory specificity. A minor deduction for the peak-beat artifact "fleshly ethereal," which introduces a slight register drift and muddles an otherwise crystal-clear closure image. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering and mystical concepts feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, tactile detail and a commitment to its emotional logic. It avoids cliché, though the concept of "sonic absolution" leans slightly toward a known archetype.</comment>
