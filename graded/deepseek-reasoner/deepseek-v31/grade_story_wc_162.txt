<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies believably; her "featherly determined" nature manifests in concrete actions like tracing the wood grain. Interiority is specific and embodied, particularly in the climax where she takes "a breath that felt like her first." The final choice to cross the threshold is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds perfectly. Closure is a decisive change (stepping into the storm) with undeniable cost, reconfiguring her understanding and path. The linkage from logbook to wood grain to temporal threshold is tight and inevitable. The orientation is masterful, establishing the impossible setting and her goal within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Drifting Prism Terrace is not merely described but is the active mechanism of the plot, constraining her choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her perception ("railing that felt like solidified air"). The logbook and desk are key objects that directly enable the climactic discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens: each discovery (logbook, wood grain code, temporal nature of thresholds) meaningfully tightens her options and deepens the stakes. The cost is legible in the shattering of the "fractured hush" into the "deafening roar" of the past, a visceral price for her choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" emerges organically from the plot and setting, culminating in the powerful, non-literal final image of her reaching to understand "the space between them." It avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant answer through the specific, earned realization of interconnected chaos and consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, analytical consciousness. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical yet precise quality ("fractured hush," "solidified air") that modulates effectively under pressure. The elision of how she decodes the weather code is purposeful and paid off by the clarity of the revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "featherly determined," which feels slightly ornamental against the otherwise concrete diction. However, the sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the climax is rendered with devastating clarity and power without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a metaphysical architecture, a temporal mystery, and a deeply personal quest feels wholly original and inevitable. The core concept of "necessary distances" is ingeniously explored through both the setting's design and the plot's central discovery. The risk-taking with structure (superimposing memory) heightens stakes and pays off brilliantly.</comment>
