<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viola's motivation is clear, rooted in a compulsion for truth, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, shown through the metallic taste of revolt and the logical exercise. The final choice to write a corrective column is a credible endurance, earned by prior causality with visible cost (foregoing profit for integrity). The only minor slip is a slight over-articulation of her logical process, but it remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds firmly from the inciting incident (the call) to the decisive change (writing the column). Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: she actively intervenes at personal/professional expense. The proof by contradiction is a motivated ellipsis that effectively narrows her options. Orientation is immediate and the final cost is legible in the act of writing the "monotonous exposé."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is indispensable, functioning as both a physical and conceptual crucible that pressures her choice. The telescope is a "silent judge," and the rosewood pen nib is a recurring object that constrains her choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional and personal priorities (e.g., "copper-wire receiver," "India ink"). The environment evolves from a hollow barrier to a foundation, mirroring her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The stake (truth vs. profit) is signaled early and tightens through her logical exercise, which forecloses the option to publish the lie. The cost is unmistakable: she must actively labor to counter the falsehood with a "dull" fact, a tangible trade-off. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length and is executed with precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus profitable lies emerges organically from events and images (telescope, pen, orbits). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth is the "ultimate intervention." The final paragraph's mention of "legacy" and "choice that held its orbit" slightly edges toward thematic statement, but it is earned by the prior particulars and avoids overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a perceptive signature suited to an observant logician. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, from the echoing sigh to the wry smile. POV is stable and the voice is consistent, with purposeful elision (the journalist's exact words are omitted). The final image's lyrical quality is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are concise and propulsive, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The assumed truth echoed back at her, silly and monstrous" advances both plot and character). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("orbits," "gravitational calculations"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Rhythm varies naturally, especially in the climactic paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a newsprint heiress in an observatory using formal logic to resolve an ethical dilemma is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core concept ("orbits of regret") is transformed from abstraction into a governing logic that shapes tactics and the final image. The story commits fully to its premise, and the choices feel inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
