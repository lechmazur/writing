<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies from passive observation to active preservation. Her micro-choice to open herself as a filter is earned by prior causality. However, her emotional state under pressure is described with some abstract phrasing ("her heart a placid lake," "felt tangled and harsh"), lacking the embodied contradiction needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with a clear before/after: Elara mends the fracture, restoring silence. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory details. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and the reconfigured understanding of her purpose. The origami swan's function is a late reveal but pays off the early setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's greatest strength. The overgrown library is vividly specific and functions as a crucible, constraining Elara's journey and supplying the "regenerative silence" she must preserve. The obsidian refuge and the black river are potent, tactile details that charge the final image and are integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the thickening air and solidifying hum, culminating in the blinding light of the fracture. Elara's agency is clear in her choice to become a filter. The cost is the shattering of her passive purpose, felt in her exhaustion and the new fragility of her peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between passive observation and active preservation. The final image—folding the swan for the next crisis—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question, reweighting her purpose without moralizing. The concept of "regenerative silence" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches the setting and Elara's role. POV is stable and deeply filtered through her perception. The only minor deduction is for a slight register drift in phrases like "a tranquility forever on the verge of collapse," which feels slightly more elevated than her immediate, embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: describing the light as "pure, unfiltered reality, screaming" mixes metaphors (visual/auditory) in a way that slightly obscures the moment's clarity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chronicler, a magical library, and a geomantic origami swan is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core concept of "regenerative silence" is a fresh, non-obvious angle that is fully committed to, with the risk-taking heightening the stakes and coherence.</comment>
