<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is unique and clearly rooted in her sensitive perception. Her embodied reaction to the negative's discovery and the wall's scream shows character under pressure. The final choice to share the story is an earned renunciation of her academic pursuit, accepting a heavy emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. The story builds through layered discoveries (diary, negative, echo) to a powerful Conceptual Repricing of Elara's role from cartographer to witness. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's "burden" and "collective memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated. The manor, fireplace, and ivy-veiled passage are not just backdrop; they constrain discovery and charge the final image. Sensory details like "scent of damp earth" and "cool plaster" are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to a moral imperative. Each discovery deepens the conflict and narrows Elara's options, culminating in the irreversible choice to testify. The cost of her perceptiveness is made painfully clear, driving the final, decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of willful ignorance and the burden of memory emerges powerfully from the concrete particulars of the diary, negative, and echo. The final image of shared testimony offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question of legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the POV character. The prose maintains a consistent, perceptive texture throughout, with rhythmic control that heightens the climactic beats ("not a whisper, but a scream"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive. Sentences are crafted for rhythm and impact, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a "corridor echo cartographer" is brilliantly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of climate allegory with gothic sensibility feels fresh and inevitable. The risk-taking with a non-standard protagonist and quiet, resonant closure pays off fully.</comment>
