<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ariadne’s motivation is clear, rooted in specific traits, and intensifies under pressure. Her embodied emotion and micro-choices, like the trembling fingers and flinch, reveal character under stress. The final renunciation of her pure-silence goal is earned by the journal’s revelation, though the grandfather remains slightly abstract, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building patterns of silence/sound to a decisive Conceptual Repricing. Causality is tight; the fireworks’ intrusion is not coincidental but thematically essential. Closure lands on-page with cost: her worldview is reconfigured, legible in "The fireworks were not an interruption, but the next entry."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, from the "shadowed workshop" to the "brass coils and polished quartz" device. The journal functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ariadne’s professional POV, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (recover grandfather’s voice) and escalate through the frequency-tuning process, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, and cost is legible in her jolt and subsequent realization. A single intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the journal’s revelation and the fireworks’ intrusion, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: empathy requires understanding noise, not just silence. The conceptual repricing is earned through specific particulars, not platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Ariadne’s acoustic perception. Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, precise quality that mirrors her profession. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, though a minor register drift occurs in "theatrical sincerity," slightly distancing the peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact: "timber" is likely a homophone error for "timbre." Figurative language is generally purposeful, though "sonic sigh of surrender" verges on mild ornamentation in a key beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing acoustics, memory, and empathy into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, insightful conclusion. The transformation of the fireworks from assault to symphony is a specific, earned inflection that heightens stakes.</comment>
