<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A masterfully executed causal plot.

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, a blend of analytical precision and poetic observation that reflects Silas's mind. POV is stable, and the elision of the family's interiority is purposeful, focusing the closure on Silas's perspective.</comment>
