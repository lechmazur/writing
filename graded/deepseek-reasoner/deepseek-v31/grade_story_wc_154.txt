<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied trauma (Kaito's cast). Her "shrewdly innocent" paradox is shown through her observational skills and persistent hope. The final choice to undergo the experimental surgery is earned by her prior causal work with the coral and cast. A slight deduction as the "shrewdly innocent" trait is more told than actively constraining an on-page choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building meaning through the recurring pattern (cast, coral, neural pathways). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: "The ghostly weight of past horrors was still there, but the paralyzing charge was gone." The linkage from memory to present action is coherent. The anesthesia timeframe is a slight underutilized pressure point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment and the child's cast function as potent micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "smelling of bleach and old blood," "porous weight"). The mist-clad atrium effectively frames the reflective moments. The surgical theatre is economically rendered but serves its purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening pattern of the coral/neural map, culminating in the high-stakes choice to undergo surgery. The dominant stake (mental peace) is clear. The cost of the procedure is legible in the final reconfiguration of her internal state. The escalation is more thematic than actively pressuring her in the present frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto trauma emerges organically from the coral/cast/neural pathway pattern. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "shared anxieties" is deeply integrated, moving from a child's fear to a universal human condition. The ending embraces complexity without false resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("a lotus-hearted ache"). The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates effectively with emotional intensity. The transition between memory and present is seamless and purposeful. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("a nervous system of scribbles"). No observable loops, scaffold, or register drift. The closing sentences land with clarity and resonant force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a child's trauma, a natural object (brain coral), and experimental neurosurgery is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded particulars. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
