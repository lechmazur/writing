<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her internal conflict between ambition and impatience is dramatized, and her final choice of acceptance feels earned. The olfactory sensitivity trait is not just a label but actively constrains her reaction to the flower's scent, a key beat. A slight deduction for the final realization leaning slightly toward abstract articulation rather than pure embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost—the relinquishment of control. Causality is tight: her frustration directly triggers the plant's reaction, leading to her epiphany. The "turning of the tide" timeframe is a minor element that doesn't actively pressure choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's professional POV. The hut, the worktable, and the pot are tactile. However, the "mysterious treetop village" setting is largely ornamental; it provides atmosphere but does not actively pressure choices or constrain tactics, capping the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift: Elara's frustrated action triggers the plant's violent reaction, which deepens the stakes and forces her final stance crystallization. The cost of her prior impatience is legible in the overwhelming sensory assault, and her ultimate endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific conflict with the corpse flower, articulated through Elara's earned epiphany that "true serenity existed within the motion... the beautiful, rotting process of life itself." The final journal entry avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's sensory perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture appropriate to the concept. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly elevated diction ("olfactorily sensitive," "journalized") that feel slightly outside a herbalist's immediate lexicon, though they are consistent with the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high information density and effective rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight thesaurus-churn feel in phrases like "olfactorily sensitive" and "journalized," which momentarily stand out from the otherwise organic and embodied description. The closure beat, however, is clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept—finding serenity within disturbance via a corpse flower—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis executed with specificity. The family custom of doodled wisdom is a particular and memorable inflection that transforms a potential trope. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
