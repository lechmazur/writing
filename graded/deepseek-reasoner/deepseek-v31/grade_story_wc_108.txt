<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his phobia and professional competence creating a compelling internal contradiction. His final choice to descend into the ocean is earned by the prior causality of the betrayal and his adaptive skills. The cost is visible in his weeping upon surfacing, solidifying his transformation from a ghost to an individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. The closure is a decisive change (retrieving the case) that reconfigures his self-concept, with cost legible in the final image of him "gasping and weeping." The because/therefore linkage from betrayal to decryption to the dive is tight and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library and the ocean are not just backdrop; they actively pressure choices and charge the final image. The library offers refuge but also the clue, while the ocean is the literal and figurative arena for his confrontation with fear, constraining his action and defining his victory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leo's agency under the Causal lens: he chooses to decrypt the clue and then to face the ocean. The stakes (proof of betrayal vs. confronting his deepest fear) are clear and the cost of the dive is intensely felt on the page, narrowing his options to a single, terrifying path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as power is earned through the specific, brutal experience of the dive, not stated. The final image of Leo clutching the case as an "anchor to his new self" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights his prior identity as a "disposable echo."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, slightly lyrical texture that fits Leo's reflective yet pressured state. POV is stable and deeply internal. A minor deduction for a few phrases that lean slightly toward the abstract ("transformative acid," "ghost in another man's action sequences") but overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally excellent with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the opening metaphor ("transformative acid") which feels slightly elevated for the otherwise concrete and embodied prose that follows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stunt double with a thalassophobia is a fresh, specific, and organic premise that drives the entire conflict. The use of a child's cast as a clue is an ingenious and memorable inflection that feels inevitable within the established world of betrayal and directorial manipulation.</comment>
