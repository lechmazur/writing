<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cassian's loneliness and visionary drive are embodied through micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of the Aerie's offer. His internal conflict between belonging and integrity is dramatized, not summarized, and the final choice feels earned by prior causality with visible cost ("a muttered oath that was equal parts prayer and curse").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; the Aerie's offer directly escalates the central conflict, forcing a climactic choice. Closure is a decisive change (amplifying the prophet's frequency) with a clear, felt cost (the console sparking, going dark). The final image of the spectrum unfolding reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico and storm are not just backdrop; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image, acting as a prism that unfolds the new dawn. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Cassian's expertise and urgency, with the environment directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens; the Aerie's offer creates a live, difficult choice that narrows options. The cost of his decision is legible on the page in the console's failure and the silent moment before the pure tone returns, charging the final victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of choosing understanding over control emerges organically from the conflict, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting "ancient shadows" and "new dawn" through the prism's spectrum without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature attuned to "weather-logic" and mechanical detail. The prophetic voice's lyrical quality contrasts effectively with the Aerie's sharp commands, and the prose rhythm modulates expertly with the storm's intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor artifact: a slight register drift in "lyrically prophetic" and "variant allegiance" feels slightly prompt-aware, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stormlit observatory, radio prophecy, and a militaristic faction feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "variant allegiance" is transformed through Cassian's specific, grounded choice, and the final reconfiguration is both inevitable and surprising.</comment>
