<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is compellingly rooted in a trans-lifetime debt, with micro-choices (searching roots, pressing the bead) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final understanding and action feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her solitary tear—a perfect blend of sorrow and peace. The ghost's "lovingly venomous" impression adds a layer of complex, contradictory pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with profound cost: the ghost's release and the orchard's renewal. The hybrid (causal-accumulative) lens holds: causal beats (finding the bead) trigger accumulative emotional revelations. The final image of the silver shoot makes the cost and new beginning legible and undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. It functions as a crucible where emotion ripens fruit, and its transformation at the end is the story's climax. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated into the POV's perception and the story's core logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the hybrid lens, pressure escalates through a meaningful tightening: the ghost's closer presence and the discovered bead force a final, costly choice. The dominant stake (repaying the debt/releasing the ghost) is narrowed to a single, irreversible act with a visible price, charging the final image with earned consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of debt, release, and cyclical renewal emerges organically from the particulars of the orchard, the bead, and the final action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the new shoot, reweighting the prior grief into a blend of sorrow and peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are meticulously controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. The ghost's "voice" is effectively rendered as a mental impression, maintaining strict POV boundaries while creating powerful subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "loving venomous," but the pattern is taught and paid off, serving the tone. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, ghost lore, and emotional horticulture is fresh and specific. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, born from established pattern and character choice.</comment>
