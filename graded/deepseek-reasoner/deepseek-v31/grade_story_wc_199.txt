<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aisling's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her changed state. The final choice feels inevitable and character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (transformation into a librarian). The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with the moonstone discovery and monument-building escalating naturally to the climax. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Arbor setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective, filtered through Aisling's POV. The environment actively shapes the narrative and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aisling's agency under the accumulative lens, with the monument-building acting as a key tightening choice. The cost of her transformation is legible and reweights the stakes. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and knowledge emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that enhances the tone. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, even under pressure. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere seamlessly. Read-aloud quality is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Concept is highly original and fully integrated, with the Arbor-as-library premise feeling fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical prose and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
