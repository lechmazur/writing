<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ellis's internal contradiction between clinical method and raw empathy is dramatized in scene, not summarized. His final choice to unify opposites is earned by the tactile trigger of the ribbon and costs him his detached refuge, making the face he finally sees unforgettable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern breaks (the analytical rhythm shattered by the ribbon's pulse). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ellis's perception is irrevocably altered; cost is legible in the "profound silence" and the mist pressing against the glass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The studio and quarry are not backdrop but active constraints. The quarry's mist mirrors Ellis's obscured perception, and the ribbon fragment directly triggers the pivotal choice. The environment charges the final image, with the mist acting as a palpable, responsive presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ellis's agency under the accumulative lens: his handling of the ribbon breaks the pattern of clinical synthesis, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is the shattering of his silent refuge, a price paid for awakening empathy, felt in the new, profound silence of the studio.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of unifying clinical observation and human empathy emerges entirely through action and image (the ribbon, the quarry, the final portrait). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I drew who she was"—that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Ellis's perceptual signature—"a furrowed hush of graphite lines." The voice is distinct, with a controlled, measured rhythm that mirrors his methodical nature before modulating into something softer and more empathetic. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the opening description ("a furrowed hush... a silent refuge... a deep gouge"). However, the language remains precise and evocative throughout, with no artifacts muddying the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, cold case investigation, and portrait artistry feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, leading to an inevitable and deeply satisfying closure. A clear, singular artistic stance.</comment>
