<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s purposefully curious nature is embodied in her meticulous, reverent actions; her deep melancholy and resolve are felt through concrete micro-choices like the slow raising of her camera. The final choice to stand her ground and witness is earned by her prior causality and carries visible cost as the machines approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts toward the Earthrise climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she chooses to witness the end, with cost legible in the vibration of the approaching machines. The sand grain timer is a minor causality strain but does not break the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar summit is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image; the geiger-camera and sand grain are tools integrated into action. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional POV, with the environment directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the impending corporate arrival and the precise timer, narrowing Elara’s options to a single, irrevocable shot. The cost is unmistakable in the final vibration through her boots, foreclosing the path of solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of loss and preservation emerges through the specific, charged image of the Earthrise above the desolate moon, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final silence, broken by the machine's hum, reweights the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose is consistently filtered through Elara's consciousness, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("The only sound... This was the dawning hush...") but does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lunar inspector, a melancholic tone, and a precise chemical timer feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and world elevate a familiar premise of corporate encroachment into a singular, memorable perspective.</comment>
