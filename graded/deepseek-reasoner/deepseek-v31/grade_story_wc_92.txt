<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied micro-choices under pressure. His calm inventiveness and ideological purity are shown through tactile actions like counting lines on the sundial and etching symbols. The final choice to reveal the quill holder to Vorlag is earned by his prior characterization, though the cost of his rebellion is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vorlag's stance softens to hope and the network awakens. The cost is the risk of treason, legible in the confrontation. Orientation is immediate; the first paragraph anchors who, where, and when with poetic efficiency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout are not just backdrop but actively constrain and enable Lysander's plan. The quill holder and sundial are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional focus (e.g., "cool, rough-hewn stone").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: revolution versus order. Escalation is driven by Lysander's agency under the causal lens, tightening with Vorlag's arrival. The cost is the palpable risk of failure, though the consequence for Lysander himself remains slightly soft, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of light versus control emerges through action and image, not statement. The final image of the "luminous hush" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether light should be hoarded or shared. Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, slightly poetic voice that remains consistent under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext in the confrontation with Vorlag.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery. Sentences are propulsive and varied. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final line is a powerful, resonant image that concludes the beat perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The combination of a lock sentinel sparking a revolution via resonant frequencies is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The sun-steel sliver and bronze quill holder feel uniquely irreplaceable. The quiet, luminous tone is a bold and coherent risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
