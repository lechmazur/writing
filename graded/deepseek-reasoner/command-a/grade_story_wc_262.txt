<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in a specific quest. Her internal state is rendered through embodied emotion ("hands trembling slightly") and a credible micro-choice to take the film strip. However, a brief lapse into diagnostic summary ("she was searching for where unused love is stored") slightly undermines the embodied peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through sensory and emotional layers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's decision to take the strip reconfigures the theater's meaning. The cost is felt in her realization of "more questions than answers." Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is a vividly rendered time capsule that charges the final image. Its specific, tactile details ("worn railing," "dusty reels") are filtered through Elara's perception. However, while it provides atmosphere, it does not heavily constrain her choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (finding unused love) and escalate through the act of projection, which deepens Elara's knowledge and narrows her options. The cost is legible in her questioning. Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal and contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete discovery of the letters, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the theater "humming with echoes," reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice. The prose has a controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("like hushed thunder"). Elision is purposeful, and the final image is legible and charged. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong sensory detail. Minor issues include a slight filter-verb stack ("Elara felt... realized... thought") in the climax and abstract nouns ("a sense of purpose") that slightly dull the closure's tactile impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry and a vintage film premise is fresh and specific. The concept of a repository for unused love is transformed through grounded, particular details (the specific letters shown). The execution commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative design without gimmickry.</comment>
