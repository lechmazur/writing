<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait (her inventive pursuit of knowledge), compelling her higher-stakes choices. Her embodied emotion is strong ("heart raced"), though some interiority edges toward summary ("felt a buried optimism"). The final choice to share her discovery feels earned by the causality of her research and the discovered warning, with a visible cost of potential peril.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she steps out with a new understanding, reconfiguring the stakes from control to harmony. The cost is legible in the mentor's warning and the peril of the experiments. Causality is tight, with each discovery leading logically to the next.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly rendered and purposefully detailed, nourishing the trees and providing the key mosaics. However, while it supplies resources (the eyes, the mosaics), it does not actively constrain a choice or palpably pressure tactics, preventing a higher score. The micro-setting of the workshop is well-integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (understanding ambiguous loss) and escalate through a meaningful tightening: the discovery of the journal and its warning fundamentally changes the knowledge and raises the cost. This escalation is driven by Elara's agency in deciphering the code and choosing to continue, with the cost of her mentor's fate felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of "mathematics of emotion" and resolves into a resonant, non-literal answer: harmony over control. The final image of the glowing orchard reweights the prior silence with promise, offering a complex answer to loss that avoids moralizing. The mentor's warning provides meaningful counterpoint and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Elara's perceptive nature. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a strong perceptual signature. The single-POV internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("peculiar object," "peculiar garden") and a template cadence in "Elara’s heart raced as she read the words." However, these do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes magic and mathematical emotion with a high degree of originality and specificity. The taxidermist's eyes are a fresh, non-obvious object that feels indispensable to the story's logic. The concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
