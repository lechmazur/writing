<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation shifts credibly from survival to discovery, driven by embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The vial's touch triggers a concrete, character-particular interiority that avoids diagnostic speech. However, her initial fear and final wonder lack the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, making the emotional progression feel slightly staged rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change (survival to discovery) with a resonant reconfiguration of the temple, felt cost in the shift of motivation. The causal lens holds: vial touch enables unsnarling, which triggers transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs as time pressure and oxygen limitation force the unsnarling action. Minor deduction for the vague "surge of energy" at the climax, which slightly softens the earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater temple is a masterfully integrated setting that pressures choices (cave-in, limited oxygen) and supplies key resources (vial, carvings). Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Maya's professional bias. The temple itself and the vial function as micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image of revealed chambers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) is signaled early and meaningfully tightens through the cave-in and dwindling oxygen, forcing the unsnarling action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the shift from fear to wonder, though the physical cost of oxygen depletion could be more visceral to heighten stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral emerges organically from the vial's attribute and the crystal chamber, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of preserved fleeting moments. Subtext operates effectively in the "gathered hush" and the lonesome splendor of solitude, enriching the thematic depth without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature reflecting Maya's expertise. Prose rhythm controls pressure well, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of unsnarling) is taught and pays off. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("ethereal glow," "lonesome splendor") that slightly clashes with the crisis lexicon but does not rupture voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is purposeful without muddle. A minor template cadence appears in "She saw... she performed..." but is not pervasive and does not touch closure, warranting a small deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of underwater temple, memory-touching vial, and unsnarling action feels organic and fresh. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on exploration narratives. Points deducted for the slightly generic "ancient civilization" trope and the convenient cave-in inciting incident, which lack transformative specificity compared to the more original elements.</comment>
