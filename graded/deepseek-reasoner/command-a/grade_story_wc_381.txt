<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied in her focused determination. Her internal state is shown through fluid thoughts and synchronized breath, though her emotional range is somewhat narrow. The final act of endurance is earned, but the lack of contradictory impulses or a visible cost to her person limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pressure builds through sensory density and rhythmic cadence shifts. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the prophecy sealed but the threat lingering. The cost is legible in the "deeper quiet" and the wing's dimmed glow, though the prophecy's resistance is summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven are masterfully integrated, acting as a crucible that mirrors Elara's internal state and provides the rhythmic pulse for her task. The crane's wing is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, its glow and movement essential to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification of sensory and rhythmic density. The dominant stake (preventing chaos) is clear, and the final surge of will represents a meaningful tightening. The cost is felt in the transformed silence, though the prophecy's thrashing resistance is told rather than shown in a key beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of silence, balance, and cosmic responsibility. The final image of the starry brook offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of maintaining fragile order. The "tranquil blaze" motif is slightly over-articulated in the final paragraph, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptions, with a distinct lyrical and rhythmic texture. The prose effectively modulates between fluid description and focused intensity during the ritual. A few phrases ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") verge on label-speak but are anchored by the overall voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a near-paraphrase loop ("smooth the hush" / "smoothed the hush") and the slightly elevated register of "terrestrially cosmic," which feels slightly outside the POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of shaping silence is a fresh, specific synthesis of magic and atmosphere. The origami crane as a relic is a memorable, grounded choice that transforms a common trope. Points are deducted for the underdeveloped "terrestrially cosmic" attribute, which remains more decorative than essential.</comment>
