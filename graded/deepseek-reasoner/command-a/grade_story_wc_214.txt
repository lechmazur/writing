<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her spiritual curiosity and quiet pride clearly motivating her discovery. Her final choice to integrate the lantern's lesson into her work is an Earned Stasis that feels consistent with her established traits. However, the "spiritually curious" attribute is more told than shown through active struggle; her epiphany arrives with minimal friction, slightly reducing the cost of her change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cost of her surrendered former perspective legible in her renewed care for her duties. The linkage from discovery to integration is coherent, though the initial activation of the tracking devices is a minor coincidence that complicates but does not resolve the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with primal elegance, and the station's hum and machinery provide a rich sensory backdrop. The yellow lantern glass functions effectively as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the station itself, while evocative, does not consistently apply pressure to constrain Lira's choices beyond providing the initial context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of spiritual discovery is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through a single, meaningful cadence shift—Lira's empathetic connection to the stars—which deepens her understanding and reweights her purpose. The cost is the quiet surrender of her old, more mechanical perspective, which is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "flourishing stillness" is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the specific events and the central metaphor of the falling stars. It provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without moralizing. The final image of the dimming lantern and the shooting star perfectly encapsulates the theme without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture and a controlled, consistent POV. The narrative voice modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the piece, from the primal description of the station to the quiet meditation of the ending. The diction remains within Lira's plausible lexicon, creating a cohesive and compelling perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The line-level craft is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, minor instances of slightly elevated or redundant phrasing ("primal elegance," "eternal canvas") create subtle register drifts that slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a cosmic janitor and a mystical lantern feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core concept of "flourishing stillness" is a specific and non-obvious synthesis that transforms a simple plot into a memorable meditation. The story commits fully to its poetic premise without retreat.</comment>
