<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied interiority ("his scars glowing faintly"). His micro-choice to place the feather back and walk away is earned by prior reflection, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("the core concept of bargained innocence resonated") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("the pain would never leave him"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through reflective density. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. A minor swiftness in the transition to enlightenment prevents a 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and porcelain box function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("soft silver glow," "cracks seemed to glow"). The box constrains choice and reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through reflective deepening under the accumulative lens, moving from personal guilt to universal connection. Agency is clear in Elias's decision to leave the box, with cost legible in his altered stance. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the box and feather, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to pain's transformation. Subtext operates in images like the cracks mirroring internal fractures, with no moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct—lyrical yet grounded, with a perceptual signature fitting a scarred firefighter ("calloused yet precise"). Purposeful compression in reflection serves closure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor mixed metaphor risk in "hard softness" is resolved by context. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a box holding others' sorrows is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details (charred oak, porcelain) avoid cliché. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
