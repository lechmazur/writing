<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear, specific, and embodied in her actions. Her excitement and determination feel earned, though the phrase "quiet determination" at the end edges toward a diagnostic label, slightly abstracting her resolved state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is dominant, building pressure through sensory and atmospheric density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing Clara's resolve with a clear, felt cost of relentless, solitary work implied by the approaching dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The "shortwave radio dial" and the mist are not just atmospheric; they actively constrain Clara's perception and enable the inciting incident, charging the final image of the room as a "threshold."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the intensifying radio glow and the elusive song, which deepens the central stake of reclaiming stories. The cost is the forfeiture of her night's rest, legible in the dawn's arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and Clara's mission. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of resurrection through work, avoiding moralizing. The "dust" motif is fully integrated rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Clara's specific, professional perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the rising tension. The voice is consistent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for the slightly precious compound phrase "ember alcove in mist," which feels momentarily contrived, though it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a story famine and a copyist resurrecting narratives through a pirate broadcast is highly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of concepts feels fresh, inevitable, and is executed with confident specificity.</comment>
