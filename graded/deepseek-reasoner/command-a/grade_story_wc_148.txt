<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling family legacy, intensifying under pressure. His final choice to reject the hush in favor of truth is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. However, his internal contradiction—chasing silence yet wanting to be heard—is summarized rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout; the discovery of the journal and its revelations create a decisive change. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: Elias foregoes the power of silence, accepting the risk of being disbelieved. The final image of dawn breaking charges the new stance with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The lattice and the copperlight chamber are not merely descriptive; they are tactile, purpose-driven objects that shape the protagonist's tactics and the story's closure with high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates meaningfully through the discovery of the journal, which narrows Elias's options and forces a high-stakes choice. The cost of his renunciation is legible on the page, altering his tactics from seeking power to seeking truth. A single, decisive tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus legacy emerges organically from the particulars of the lattice and the journal, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through Elias's stance shift. A minor deduction for the slightly explicit articulation of the theme in the final lines ("the boy who chased truth").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistently filtered through Elias's perception, with a distinct textual signature. The prose is controlled and purposeful, with rhythmic variation that supports emotional beats. The lattice's "hum" is a clean example of voice-motivated elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "copperlight repose" is slightly elevated and risks register drift, though it is largely taught by the context. No loops or scaffolding obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "boy who cried wolf" mythos with a gothic lighthouse prison feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with specific world logic and a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk is heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
