<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli's characterization is concrete, with his "functionally creative mind" driving specific micro-choices that escalate under pressure. His motivation to find a "new equation for hope" is dramatized through his on-page experiments, though the final choice to leave feels slightly more told than shown, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through patterned density (air, light, memory) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with cost ("a story, a testament to human ambition") and the lens holds, though the final beat's summary of his internal shift slightly softens the on-page impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling Eli's choices. The environment is not just described but used tactically ("opened vents," "propped up mirrors"), and its specific details ("cracked tiles," "torn banners") charge the final image of resurrection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the Accumulative lens, as his experiments with redirecting flows intensify the stakes from assessment to resurrection. The cost is legible in the transformation of the terminal's atmosphere, though the pressure could have been slightly more coherently linked to a single, dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the terminal and the sextant, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of hope through "resurrection and reinvention," though the phrase "equation for hope" borders on thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The POV is stable and filtered through Eli's engineer mindset, with a distinct perceptual signature ("systems, networks of cause and effect"). The prose is generally controlled, though occasional phrases like "stoic wonder" feel slightly summary-like rather than fully embodied in the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong sensory detail and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "new equation for hope" / "patterns in chaos"), but these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a civil engineer in a spaceport, using a sextant to redirect flows of memory, is a fresh, non-obvious angle on a familiar premise of rediscovery. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting make the combination feel organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
