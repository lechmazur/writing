<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in contradictory impulses—duty and rebellion—that act simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to plant the nut is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the trembling ground and the mechanical birds' warning cries. Micro-choices under pressure, like assembling the map and saving the traveler, reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labels, though interiority could be slightly more granular in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: the nut's discovery leads directly to experimentation, map assembly, rescue, and closure. Closure is a decisive change (the bud emerging) with felt cost (the birds' persistent threat and the unresolved curse). Orientation is immediate and precise. The persistent constraint of the curse shapes tactics and the final image, charging the poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and constrains choices: the labyrinth's paths necessitate the map, the mechanical birds force evasion, and the orchard's cursed soil charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's familiarity. The nut functions as a micro-setting object that reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Elara's active experimentation with the nut tightens options and leads to the map assembly. The dominant stake (breaking the curse) deepens with the bud's emergence, and cost is legible in the trembling ground. However, the traveler's arrival feels slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: graceless beauty (mechanical birds), duty vs. rebellion, and forgotten blueprints are woven into action and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bud's emergence. Avoids moralizing, though the thematic weight relies heavily on the final paragraph's image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that biases observation toward the cursed and mechanical. Syntax and rhythm modulate with urgency, and purposeful elision (e.g., the traveler's minimal dialogue) serves closure. No head-hopping or register drift. The voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structures. Figurative language ("fractured spine," "wings whirred like broken gears") is precise and legible. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor rhythm flatness in mid-paragraph transitions prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (cursed orchard, labyrinth, mechanical guardians) feels fresh through specific voice and stakes. The nut as a key and the blueprint concept are non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with tone ("graceless beauty") heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
