<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in desperation, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., hand tightening around the ampoule). Liora’s telepathy is a consistent trait that drives action, but its internal contradiction (immovable yet connected) is more stated than dramatized through simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Liora’s warning directly alters Elara’s actions. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in Elara’s gratitude and Liora’s purpose. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. One meaningful tightening (the warning) narrows options convincingly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (“muted coral arches,” “tangled seaweed”) and supports tone. However, the environment does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the village) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Liora’s telepathic intervention, which introduces doubt and complicates Elara’s certainty. Cost is legible in her hesitation and later adjustments, aligning with causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (nuance vs. certainty) emerges organically through the ampoule’s fragility and Liora’s kindness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer but slightly moralizes in the final paragraph (“power of embracing complexity”), costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward Liora’s telepathic awareness. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., “frantic, a jumble of curiosity”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule”). Minor scaffold in phrases like “incisively kind understanding” feels slightly decorative but does not obscure closure. Rhythm supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise (telepathic statue, fragile ampoule) is fresh and specific, transforming tropes through grounded choices. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
