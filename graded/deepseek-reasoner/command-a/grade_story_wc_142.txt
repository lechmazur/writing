<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is shown through her "pride and exhaustion," and her final action is earned. However, the "orderly intuitive" trait is more told than shown through specific, constraining choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final image of the stone chip and graffiti art becoming a "collective voice." The inferred Causal lens holds from the inciting incident through to the festival's outcome. A persistent constraint (the threat of privatization) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, establishing tone and context. However, while it supplies resources (the marketplace, barges), it does not consistently constrain Lira's choices or tactics in a way that charges the final image, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent and driven by Lira's agency, moving from discovery to decoding to rallying the community. The cost of resistance is legible in Vorin's opposition and the community's "hopeful desperation." The score is capped as the primary pressure remains external (Vorin's plans) rather than a tightening of a persistent, on-page constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of community vs. erasure emerges powerfully from the graffiti's encoded messages and the festival display, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The final image of the foundation stone chip surrounded by art successfully reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The narrative voice effectively filters the world through Lira's perceptive lens. A minor deduction for a occasional cliché ("wave of his hand") and a slight convergence in dialogue between Lira and Vorin's confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence in "a haven for the displaced, a perpetual carnival" and a slightly mixed metaphor in "a rallying cry, a hopeful desperation." These do not significantly obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a raft city and graffiti-as-historical-record feels fresh and specific. The core concept is executed with integrity, though the central conflict of gentrification is a familiar trope that is transformed effectively through the unique setting and method.</comment>
