<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied ("bleak exhilaration," "hands trembling"). The final endurance is earned, though the "neatly inventive" trait could show more contradictory impulses in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly from setup to decisive change. Closure lands on-page with clear cost ("no going back," "consequences impossible to predict"). The lighthouse's counter-clockwise transformation is a potent, legible image of the irreversible shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and hunger stone are masterfully integrated, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional bias ("rusted gears," "scent of salt and decay"). The environment itself becomes an antagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate coherently under the causal lens. The tide provides a live clock, and the stone's awakening creates tangible pressure that narrows options. The cost is legible in the island's resistance and Elias's final unease.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of defying fate emerges organically through action and image, resisting moralizing. The final reconfiguration offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The "bleak exhilaration" perfectly captures the complex emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, inventive signature. Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("bleak exhilaration" edges toward diagnostic label-speak).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats and the phrase "bleak exhilaration" which feels slightly tell-y at a crucial moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a clockmaker, a hunger stone, and a yoyo as a temporal mechanism is fresh and ingenious. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on time manipulation, executed with specificity and full commitment to its implications.</comment>
