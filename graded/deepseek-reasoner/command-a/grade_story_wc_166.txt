<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies under pressure. Her final stance—standing tall, verse as shield—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost (risk of erasure). Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "hands trembled," avoiding diagnostic speak. Micro-choices (uncorking vial, pressing quill to skin) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with cost: the sentinel's retreat reconfigures the stakes, making Lira's defiance a beacon. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation via pattern breaks (gaps, wind's song) and a cadence shift at the sentinel's arrival. The cost is legible in Lira's readiness to face consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (rooted feet, spatial choreography) and charging the final image (flowers whispering "fledge"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, e.g., "shadows stretched like whispers," though minor overwriting ("obsidian grace") slightly dulls immediacy. Spatial coherence and POV filter are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens: her dance and writing intensify the stake (forbidden act), culminating in the sentinel's arrival. Cost is unmistakable ("discovery meant erasure"). One meaningful tightening (sentinel's approach) forecloses options, forcing her stance crystallization without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (gaps, verse, exile) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sentinel's retreat and the whispered "fledge," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., the dust capturing "essence of forgotten memories."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control ("petals unfurling like pages of a forgotten book"). Compression and patterned elision (e.g., "gaps" motif) are taught and paid off at closure. POV is stable and apt, with diction consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and variation. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("obsidian grace" appears twice) triggers a -0.4 deduction, but no loops or scaffold obscure closure. Figurative language is generally coherent and advances atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar concepts (dystopian ban, artistic defiance) into a fresh, non-obvious whole via specific details (tide dancer, moonstone dust). Risk-taking (lyric mode, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise commits fully and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
