<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's heartbreak and motivation to name nameless fears are clear and compel her final choice. Her internal conflict is embodied and her emotional progression from grief to purpose is credible. A minor deduction for the backstory summary ("after she lost the one soul...") which, while brief, tells a pivotal emotional beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost on the page ("her heartbreak had not been in vain"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered imagery and a decisive cadence shift. The observatory's mechanics are taught and pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's grief. The observatory and atlas page are well-anchored. However, the setting is more atmospheric than constraining; it provides resources but does not actively pressure or narrow her choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate under the Accumulative/Textural lens through a meaningful cadence shift and density increase. The cost of her choice is legible in the final image. Agency is demonstrated through her act of naming, which reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose in loss emerges organically from the specific action of naming. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "echo of sacrifice" is integrated into the climax, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "a distant intimacy," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, voice is controlled and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a template cadence run: "words of loss, of hope, of love." This slight artifice is noticeable but does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of a heartbroken reaper and a mystical atlas feels fresh and organic. The emotional specificity of grief transforming into creation elevates a familiar trope. The final reconfiguration is earned and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
