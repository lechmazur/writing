<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final renunciation of the burden is earned by prior causality, though the "attentively inventive" trait is more stated than shown in peak beats, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with the burden remaining as a "silent companion." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pattern density toward a decisive conceptual repricing. Cost is legible in the final image of the enduring burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is a masterful micro-setting that actively charges the final image, its branches "reaching toward the heavens" as a witness. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, with a clear tightening as the pattern is deciphered. The cost of the enduring burden is felt, though the final choice could be slightly more fraught to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of burden, trust, and resilience, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the parachute buckle from a tool to a symbol without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong, though a slight over-reliance on similar sentence structures in high-pressure moments prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the second paragraph ("It was more than... It was a reminder...") and a slightly over-written description of the clouds "forming shapes that mirrored the seeker’s thoughts."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sky-bound arbor, a pattern-seeking watcher, and a parachute buckle as a relic feels fresh and organic. The concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular vision, avoiding cliché.</comment>
