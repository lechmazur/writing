<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal regret, compelling her choices. Her final act of reading her own letter is a credible endurance with visible cost, earning the closure. However, a slight tendency toward abstract emotional summary ("felt whole") in the climax prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through layered imagery and the shard's intensifying glow. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, landing with clear cost as the spirits fall silent and Elara feels whole. The persistent constraint of her personal regret shapes the entire journey and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and the gargoyle shard are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining and guiding Elara's choices. The shard's use to reveal messages and the final letter on the pedestal charge the closure image, making the setting indispensable to the plot's mechanics and emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the increasing density of messages and the shard's intensifying energy, culminating in the confrontation with her own letter. The cost of facing this personal regret is legible and reweights the dominant stake, though the final beat's emotional summary slightly softens the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken regret emerges organically through the specific, concrete particulars of the unsent letters and Elara's personal journey. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the letter becoming a "bridge," avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptive quality that filters the setting through Elara's consciousness. The patterned elision of how the shard works is taught early and pays off at closure. A few phrases verge on slightly elevated diction ("fierce tenderness") but remain within the voice's established register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor instances of near-paraphrase ("unspoken apologies"/"unspoken words") and a tendency toward abstract summary in the final paragraphs ("felt whole") prevent a higher score, though closure clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cryptic medium, a magical shard, and a labyrinth of regret feels fresh and organic. The core concept of unsent letters is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and character motive, resulting in a singular and memorable perspective.</comment>
