<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong, with clear, contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. need for truth) acting simultaneously. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though a minor reliance on telling ("driven by the weight...") slightly abstracts the embodied cost at the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (freeing the souls) with a clear, felt cost ("the weight lift from her chest"). The causal lens holds tightly from discovery of the valve wheel to its use. The persistent constraint of her father's truth shapes her tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the setting actively pressuring choices. The valve wheel qualifies as a micro-setting that charges the final image, though its constraint on choice is more passive (a key to be used) than active.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from hearing the sounds to inserting the wheel. The cost of confronting the screaming shadows is legible, and the dominant stake (finding truth/closure) is meaningfully tightened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of inherited truth and belief emerges organically from the father-daughter dynamic and the ghost shift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of dissolving light and lifted weight, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature biased by Mara's skepticism and urgency. The prose effectively modulates with emotional intensity, though a slight convergence into more summary-like phrasing occurs at the climax ("driven by the weight...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and clarity. Minor artifacts include a slight scaffold phrase ("driven by the weight...") in the high-pressure beat and a near-paraphrase loop between "swallowed truth" and "father's swallowed truth."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar ghost story and personal quest tropes through specific, grounded details like the valve wheel and radio psychics. It feels organic, though the concept of a "factory ghost shift" is a known trope transformed by the father-daughter lens.</comment>
