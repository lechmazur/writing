<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find freedom by embracing her true nature is clear and consistently drives her choices. Her internal conflict is embodied in the climactic act of detaching from her fears, which feels earned by prior causality. The final renunciation has a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) achieved through Elara's on-page choice to detach, with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density. The island's appearance and the heart's unlocking are pattern-taught and pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and disappearing island are not just backdrop but actively constrain and enable Elara's choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The island's emergence is a key environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (freedom through self-acceptance) are signaled early. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in following the whale's call and confronting the island's barrier. The cost of detachment is legible and reweights the final image under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing one's true nature emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The scrimshaw and island serve as integrated motifs that deepen meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic yet grounded texture. Elision (e.g., the island's mechanics) is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Internal perception remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor abstraction in "combative tenderness" slightly dulls the closure image, but no loops or scaffold issues. Rhythm supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a disappearing island, whale call, and guarded heart feels fresh and inevitable. Risks with lyrical prose and accumulative structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors the universal theme.</comment>
