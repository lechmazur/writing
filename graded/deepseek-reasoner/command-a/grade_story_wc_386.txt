<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desire to "give voice to the voiceless." Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the opening ("her heart quickened") and closing ("her fingers tracing its cracked surface"). However, her professional title ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer") is more declarative than demonstrated through on-page, pressure-driven choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the globe clearing reconfigures the meaning of her work with a felt cost of emotional labor. Causality is clear: the method of analyzing dreams directly leads to the assembled story. Orientation is immediate and effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a major strength. The "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" is not merely descriptive; it actively constrains and enables Elara's method, functioning as the crucible for the entire scene. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through her POV, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the deepening pattern of dream revelations, which reweights the stake of salvaging a pure story. The cost is the emotional weight of the revelation. A minor deduction as the escalation is somewhat passive, driven by received visions rather than active, difficult choices by Elara.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific particulars of the snow globe and the sunken ship. The final image of the clearing globe offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and preservation. It avoids moralizing, instead achieving its effect through concrete action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent and controlled throughout. The voice is perfectly suited to the ethereal, quiet subject matter. POV is stable, and the selective elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of dream-weaving) is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive without a single discernible loop or artifact. Figurative language ("a place of borrowed starlight") is consistent, taught, and pays off. A near-flawless execution that supports the closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" using dream analysis is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The quiet, accumulative risk-taking heightens the stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
