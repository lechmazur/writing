<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the aurora-lit archway scene. Her motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, though the connection between her ability and the astrolabe's function remains slightly abstract, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Charged Poise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the archway awakening and the astrolabe trembling. The cost is felt in her "mixture of fear and exhilaration," though the escalation is more a deepening of atmosphere than a causal tightening of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully integrated, with the aurora-lit archway and astrolabe charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects Lira's unique perception, creating a rich, cohesive atmosphere that constrains her ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing creativity) is clear, but escalation is primarily atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency. Pressure accumulates texturally through the intensifying aurora and awakening archway, but Lira's role is more receptive than active, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of cosmic whispers, remembered stardust, and Lira's quest. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, though the concept of "freeing trapped creativity" remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality that perfectly reflects Lira's character. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with the scene's emotional intensity without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. Minor instances of near-synonym churn ("shadowed rapture," "beautiful and haunting") and a slightly over-reliant pattern of figurative language prevent a higher score, though clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic listening, remembered stardust, and a brass astrolabe feels fresh and specific. The perspective is memorable, though the core concept of freeing creativity is a familiar archetype, transformed here through particular, grounded details.</comment>
