<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait (drawn to the unknown), compelling his high-stakes choice to decode the tapestry. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, though his emotional state during the intense decoding process could be more embodied and contradictory, leaning slightly toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the silo transforms into a cathedral, reconfiguring meaning with a felt cost of time and focused endurance. The inferred Accumulative lens holds, with pressure building through the increasing density of the tapestry's emotional patterns. A single, meaningful cadence shift is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and sovereign case function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, deeply filtered through Elias's professional and personal priorities. The silo's transformation is the story's pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification through the act of decoding, which deepens Elias's knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of understanding. The cost of elapsed time and focused endurance is legible on the page, narrowing his options to a single, consuming task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of enduring intentions emerges organically from the tapestry's decoded patterns and the final image of the silo as a cathedral, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. It is an emergent property of the central conflict and character goal, though the concept of "intentions" is occasionally stated rather than solely shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the prose's rhythm and diction that reflects Elias's contemplative nature. The voice is confident and consistent, with purposeful compression in the decoding sequence that supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and varied syntax, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "velveteen gloom" appears twice). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A slight register drift in the final paragraph ("piece of humanity") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding a map of emotions—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of gardener, cemetery, and emotional tapestry is organic and singular, executed with a bold, specific vision that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
