<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific worldview, with micro-choices (deciphering patterns, turning inward) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance of stillness is earned through the dramatized appraisal. However, interior contradiction is more summarized than acted out in scene, and the emotional state remains somewhat monolithic, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear before/after shift from seeking to understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the density of observation and the cadence shift into internalization. The cost of this hard-won stillness is felt in the final image of Kael blending into the shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the protagonist's perception and the story's thematic core. The canyon and bone towers provide a powerful atmosphere. However, the setting primarily functions as atmosphere and symbol; it does not actively constrain a choice or alter tactics in a way that would warrant a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the intensifying pattern recognition and the subsequent internalization of the message. The stake (understanding the arrowhead's purpose) is clear and deepens meaningfully. The cost is the protagonist's shift from external seeking to internal navigation, which is legible and charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding stillness within motion emerges organically from the specific actions of appraisal and internalization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative, avoiding moralizing. The integration of concept (pulse), object (arrowhead), and action (appraisal) is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose exhibits a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. POV is stable and deeply fused with the protagonist's consciousness. The only minor restraint is a slight uniformity in the elevated diction, but it never breaks clarity or purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting (e.g., "the pulse left wandering through the air") and employs a high density of figurative language that, while often beautiful, creates minor drag on momentum and clarity in places, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "harmonic stone skimmer" deciphering bird patterns to appraise a relic is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic vision, transforming its components into a fresh, cohesive whole.</comment>
