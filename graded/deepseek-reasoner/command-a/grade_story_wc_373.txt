<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in her background, with concrete interiority ("a weight that isn't yours to bear"). Her final stance crystallization is credible, though the choice to walk away feels more declared than fully dramatized under peak pressure, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Causal lens holds; the watch fob's theft motivates Lila's search, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the climax with the thieves is resolved through declaration rather than a fully dramatized, causal turn, slightly weakening the closure's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pirate market is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("salt and decay"). It functions as more than a backdrop, pressuring Lila's movement and choices, though it does not decisively constrain a key tactical choice to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate coherently under the Causal lens. Lila's agency drives the confrontation, but the resolution feels slightly facile for the built tension, with the thieves' capitulation undercutting the promised cost of the game.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges effectively through the watch fob and the "truce of hush." However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one...") moralizes and summarizes, replacing the earned, implicit resonance of the prior scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, textured narrative filter ("labyrinth of shadows and whispers"). Dialogue is economical and goal-driven, carrying subtext. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and varied, propulsive syntax. No artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle. A single minor filter verb stack ("seemed to see") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of elements feels organic, and the perspective is fresh. However, the core concept and climax hew closely to familiar noir and revenge templates, lacking a truly transformative or non-obvious inflection to elevate it further.</comment>
