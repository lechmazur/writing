<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, particularly in her micro-choices with the fossil. Her motivation deepens credibly from mapping to uncovering history. However, the final shift to "voice of the unknown" feels slightly declarative rather than fully dramatized by a prior micro-choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with emotional patterns intensifying to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the glowing chamber. Orientation is immediate, causality is intact, and closure lands on-page with a clear conceptual cost of connecting to a forgotten world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action ("scent of salt and damp earth"). The cave network pressures her choices and the fossil charges the final image. It does not, however, decisively constrain a major tactical choice, capping it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to urgent discovery under the accumulative lens. Protagonist agency drives each turn, most notably in her decision to follow the fossil. The cost of her altered purpose and connection to the past is legible, though the price paid is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of her work, the fossil, and the caves, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about the endurance of emotion. The concept of "transitional objects" is fully baked into the plot and character arc without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, measured rhythm. The prose effectively filters the world through Elara's professional and curious perspective. A minor deduction for occasional phrases that edge toward poetic abstraction ("breathing feelings into the air") which slightly soften the narrative certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the fossil's purpose ("key, not just to the caves but to something greater"). This artifact does not touch the closure but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory map-making, emotional archaeology, and a post-hibernation history feels fresh and specific. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, particular details, making the ending feel inevitable.</comment>
