<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent obsession with time and memory. Her final choice to place the fragment is earned by prior causality, though the climax's emotional peak ("beautiful and terrifying") edges toward abstract summary rather than fully embodied contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with a resonant reconfiguration; the fragment's disintegration transforms Elara and the maze. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a clear before/after shift. The cost of the fragment's loss is legible on the page, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered and actively pressures Elara's choices, constraining her path and shaping the climax. The maze's hyperbolic geometry and the pedestal are key objects that charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the maze's warping geometry and the fragment's growing warmth, tightening options under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (discovering time's texture) is tested, and the cost of the fragment's dissolution is felt, though the protagonist's agency in triggering the climax is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and time emerges organically from the fading photographs and the fragment's power. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Elara's internal restoration—that reweights the prior material without moralizing. The integration is specific and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled perceptual signature. Some minor register drift occurs in the climax ("beautiful and terrifying," "cascade of images"), slightly distancing the POV at the peak moment, but the voice remains largely coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, slight overwriting appears in the climax with abstract, summary-like language ("beautiful and terrifying," "cascade of images") that slightly dulls the immediacy of the high-pressure beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a hedge maze designer, a temporal artifact, and a metaphysical quest feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details in the setting and character motive, resulting in a singular artistic stance that avoids template plotting.</comment>
