<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical and socially perceptive traits are embodied, not labeled, driving her choices to pick up the tile and interject it. Her motivation to find meaning is dramatized through her interaction with the mandala, and her final stance—to stand in the mess—is an Earned Stasis with visible cost ("her heart alight with the emergent hush"). A hairline slip: the "lilac unease" is a slightly diagnostic label, but it is quickly embodied and paid off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of the mandala deepens into understanding, reconfiguring Elara's stance from seeking meaning to creating it. The cost is legible on the page: "her chalk-stained hands trembling slightly." The "unlearning" timeframe is the one weak point, feeling more thematic than a concrete pressure, but it doesn't break the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with mist and whispering tiles, creating a rich atmosphere. It functions as a micro-setting that pressures Elara's perception. However, it falls just short of the 9-band gate because while it supplies the key object (the tile), the environment itself doesn't actively constrain a choice; the mandala is the primary agent of change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and deepening. The stake (discovering meaning) is signaled early and intensifies as the mandala's patterns respond, narrowing Elara's options to a stance of listening. The cost of this understanding—the trembling hands, the carried unease—is felt and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding/creating meaning in silence and fragmentation emerges masterfully from the particulars of the mandala and the grotto's history. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of Elara carrying the story reweights the prior material, transforming the "emergent hush" from a tragedy into a guide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, whimsical consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("mist clung to the air like a reluctant lover") that modulates under pressure without losing coherence. The elision of the grotto people's history is purposeful and pays off in the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the opening simile ("like a reluctant lover") and the label "lilac unease," though both are quickly grounded in embodiment. The closure beat is clear and propulsive, devoid of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sand mandala, a whispering grotto, and a concept like "emergent hush" is fresh and organic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in voice and setting elevate it beyond a template, committing fully to its lyrical premise. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative plot heightens the stakes.</comment>
