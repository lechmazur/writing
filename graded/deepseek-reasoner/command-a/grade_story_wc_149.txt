<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("fingers trembling") and a clear, conflicted motivation. The "lovingly venomous" connection to the bead shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. A micro-choice to clutch the bead reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final stance crystallization—confronting collective pain—is earned by the bead's awakening and the surge of other spirits' sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is taught early and holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she steps into the night with hope and reckoning. The cost is legible in the "mingle[ing]" of sorrows that "both comforted and burdened her." Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the bead's awakening provides a coherent, meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake from personal to collective debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures choice and charges the final image as a "threshold." The ancient tree and carved bead are recurring objects that constrain choice and shape the closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, such as "petrified blossoms" and "winter-cracked fields," all filtered through the ghost's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the bead's awakening draws other spirits, reweighting the dominant stake from a personal to a collective debt. The protagonist's agency is clear in her choice to confront this collective pain. The cost is legible on the page as the sorrow that "both comforted and burdened her," charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the bead, the tree, and the collective whispers, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of debt and freedom through the image of a "beacon of resonant awakenings." The "lovingly venomous" connection and "mournful elation" are embodied subtext that deepens the thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent, poetic perceptual signature ("whisper, a flicker of light in the endless night"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the ghost's consciousness. The prose's rhythmic density is high but occasionally risks overwriting ("lovingly venomous connection"); however, the pattern is taught and legible, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting and mixed metaphor (e.g., "lovingly venomous" is a strained conjunction). There is minor scaffold in adjacent sentences restating the bead's importance, but no major loops or artifacts that obscure causality. The closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost bride, an alchemical orchard, and a resonant bead feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a collective debt across lifetimes is a non-obvious angle on a familiar trope. The risk-taking in the dense, poetic prose heightens the stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains legible and charged.</comment>
