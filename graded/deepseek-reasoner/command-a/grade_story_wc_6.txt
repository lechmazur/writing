<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply felt, with embodied emotion and a clear, profound motivation. The final choice to graft is earned by her history and internal conflict, though a minor tendency to tell her emotional state ("heart alight with hope") slightly undermines the otherwise shown interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with palpable cost in the final image of peace and singing scars. The lens holds from the dense opening to the charged ending. A slightly more explicit articulation of the cost in the final beat would secure a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not merely vivid backdrop; they actively constrain Elara's choice and charge the final image. The setting is a crucible that defines the central conflict and its potential resolution, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift and density increase, culminating in the grafting act which reweights the dominant stake. The cost of her father's legacy is a persistent constraint, though the on-page price of the specific graft action could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of transformation and resilience emerges organically from the specific, concrete particulars of Elara's act and history. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, perfectly integrated through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature firmly anchored in Elara's POV. The voice is consistent and effective, though a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives and parallel structures creates a minor, patterned cadence that lightly diminishes the distinctiveness under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts appear, including a template cadence in descriptions ("black sand," "obsidian water") and a slight over-density of figurative language in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an arsonist's daughter becoming a firefighter who seeks to graft life into sterile sand is a specific, non-obvious, and deeply organic concept. The perspective feels fresh and memorable, committed fully to its premise without retreat into cliché.</comment>
