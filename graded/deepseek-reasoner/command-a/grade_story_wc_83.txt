<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and rooted in profound trauma, compelling her search for meaning. Her internal conflict is embodied through concrete interaction with the geode crystals, and her final realization is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a moment of slightly abstract phrasing ("unfiltered awakening") in an otherwise embodied peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the final image of the geode as a talisman, reconfiguring her stance from survivor to seeker with a felt cost of her past loss. The inferred Causal lens holds tightly through her deliberate, perturbation-driven actions. The final cost is legible in the contrast between the broken world and her newfound purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystals are not merely described but are integral to the plot, constraining and enabling Zara's choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her trauma, with the "scent of ash and char" and the "cool surface" of the crystal creating a vivid, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Zara's agency under the Causal lens, moving from observation to active hunting for patterns. The stake (finding purpose) tightens meaningfully through her discovery that the hunt is about embracing the process. The cost of her past loss is the persistent constraint that charges every step forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of destruction and creation, embodied in the geode crystals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: potential is forged through pressure and process. The integration is seamless, avoiding moralizing and arising from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by grief and scientific curiosity. The voice is consistent, though a slight register drift into the academic ("perturbation theory") is noticeable but voice-motivated by her character. Prose effectively reflects her state of mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor deduction for a cluster of abstract nouns in the peak beat ("spark of unfiltered awakening," "repository of potential") which slightly dull the immediacy of an otherwise embodied and concrete climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept sci-fi (floating observatory) with deep, raw human emotion (wedding drone strike) is original and feels inevitable. The use of perturbation theory as a narrative engine is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the core concept.</comment>
