<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique trait of seeing ghosts, compelling his investigation. His methodical, observant nature is shown through concrete actions like analyzing dust patterns. The final choice to engage with the clock is a credible endurance that forecloses a path, though the emotional cost of his "weightless burden" is slightly abstract at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (the building healing) with a felt cost (the ghosts' release and Marcus's sense of closure). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory details and ghostly whispers. The linkage from the whisper "engage" to inserting the barrel is a meaningful tightening, though the climax's mechanics are slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, from the flickering lights to the dust patterns Marcus analyzes. The circus ticket office is a micro-setting that constrains and enables his investigation. Key objects like the mainspring barrel and the ceiling void are integral to the plot and charge the final image of the healing facade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (discovering what ceilings hide) and escalate through the coalescing whispers and the ghost's directive. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory and supernatural density. The protagonist's agency in climbing and inserting the barrel is a decisive act that narrows options and delivers closure with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of past and present, neglect and repair. The concept of "cracks in the façade" is a recurring image that charges the final healing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the ticking clock, reweighting Marcus's purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Marcus's professional, observant lens. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a strong perceptual signature ("the dust was thicker in some places"). The single line of ghostly dialogue ("engage") is purposeful and advances the plot. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly abstract phrase "weightless burden" at a peak moment, but it does not significantly obscure clarity or closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is a fresh, non-obvious angle on supernatural fiction. The concept feels organic and is fully committed to, with specific details grounding the premise. The choice to heal rather than vanquish is a thoughtful subversion of genre expectations that heightens stakes.</comment>
