<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, dramatized failure. Her internal conflict between fear and desire to understand is present, though her emotional state could be more embodied in the peak choice. The final choice to play the flute feels earned by her established drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: actions link because/therefore. Closure is a valid Charged Poise, crystallizing her new purpose. The cost of her past failure is legible, but the cost of this specific act (playing the flute) is less tangible, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent ("canyon hush," "thunder-echo"). The canyon and flute are specific and purposeful. However, the environment does not sufficiently constrain her choices; it is more backdrop than active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieving the flute to prevent disaster) is clear. Escalation is present but mild, driven by her internal hesitation rather than external pressure. The cost of the choice is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of learning from failure emerges organically from the plot and is resolved in a resonant, non-literal final image. The concept of "weaving between worlds" is integrated into the thematic core without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. Some minor repetitive phrasing ("canyon hush") and a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful. Minor artifacts include the repetitive use of "canyon hush" and the slightly awkward adverb "avalanchingly." The sentence "The air was heavy with the weight of the canyon hush" is a near-paraphrase loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a relic keeper and a world-weaving flute feels organic, not a checklist. The execution is strong and specific, though the core premise itself is a familiar fantasy trope, executed well but without significant transformation.</comment>
