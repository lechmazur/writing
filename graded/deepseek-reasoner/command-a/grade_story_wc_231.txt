<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling to examine the boot print). The final endurance is earned, though a minor slip occurs with a slightly diagnostic label ("a strange sense of peace") at the climax, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost ("filling the gaps as best he could"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through pattern and density increases (mist, journal, recurring motifs) to a decisive cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric, with the mist and dock acting as a persistent pressure. It charges the final image but falls just short of concretely constraining a pivotal choice, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is masterful under the accumulative lens, with the discovery of the boot print and journal providing a meaningful, agency-driven deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of accepting the trust is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and isolation emerges organically from the core concept and particulars. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the story's material without moralizing, perfectly integrated with the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (the stranger's identity) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly atmospheric with strong momentum. A single, minor paraphrase loop ("softly persistent" used twice in close succession) and one slightly elevated diction choice ("psychic weight") in a peak beat prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper and borrowed memories feels fresh and organic. The specific, grounded choices in voice and setting elevate a familiar trope, though the core concept itself is not radically unprecedented.</comment>
