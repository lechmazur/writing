<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation ("to teach darkness the value of stars") is clear and consistent, compelling their subtle actions. Their silent empathy is a credible, embodied skill. The stranger's emotional progression from despair to hope feels earned, though their internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the completed shutter pattern and the stranger's lifted burden create a before/after change with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern density. The final image reconfigures meaning without a causal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the guardian's POV. The cobalt dock and rain-slick planks establish a strong atmosphere. However, the setting and objects (mirror, shutters) describe mood and enable action but do not materially constrain a choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (the stranger's internal burden) is signaled early. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens, achieved through the increasing density of the shutter-weaving action and the stranger's gradual unburdening. A single meaningful cadence shift reweights the stake with a visible cost in the stranger's lighter demeanor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of finding light in darkness, realized through the specific, non-literal actions of the guardian. The final image of the shutter-constellation offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The metaphor is fully integrated and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the guardian's perceptive, calm voice. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm and texture. The single line of dialogue is natural and serves its purpose, but the story's strength is in its consistent internal focalization and lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the adverb "spiralingly" feels slightly contrived, and the phrase "stillwater tension" is a near-cliché. However, these do not significantly harm momentum or clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a silent canal guardian using a dental mirror and weaving shutters is highly original and specific. The combination feels organic and singular, not derivative. The quiet, accumulative risk-taking heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the story's tone and closure.</comment>
