<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Herald's motivation is clear and intensifies compellingly, with embodied emotion ("panic flickered... quickly replaced by curiosity") and a micro-choice ("grasped the wick") that reveals their hierarchy of values. However, the initial "shadowed elation" feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant Conceptual Repricing under a Hybrid lens; the final image of the "green dawn" reweights the premise with undeniable cost. Causality is tight, with the Herald's prophetic actions ("accidentally prophetic, each twist of the wick") earning the revelation and their decisive steering action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick are masterfully integrated, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("beam slicing through the night like a sword of light"), with the setting actively shaping the climax through the fog and gateway.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, with a clear tightening as the beam veers out of control, forcing a reactive choice. The cost is legible in the "gateway of swirling light" and the emergence of beings, though the stakes shift slightly from shaping a dawn to guiding beings home.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of bridging worlds emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with the "green dawn." The final image reweights the "ancient shadows" motif without moralizing, though the concept is slightly more declared than earned in the middle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a lyrical, elevated register that fits the otherworldly concept ("a dance of precision and whimsy"). The perceptual signature is strong, though the register occasionally drifts into near-purple prose ("shadowed elation"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacting occurs with slightly over-written phrases ("shadowed elation") and a template cadence in early description ("its beam slicing... like a sword of light"). Clarity remains intact, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical lighthouse keeper, prophetic routine, and physics-based magic feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully, with risk-taking in the lyrical voice and the transformation of the lighthouse trope into a bridge between worlds.</comment>
