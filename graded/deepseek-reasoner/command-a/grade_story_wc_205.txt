<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in a desire for redemption. Her internal conflict and embodied emotion are strong, particularly in the climax where tears are "not of joy but of burnished sorrow." The final endurance feels earned, though the phrase "burnished sorrow" edges toward diagnostic labeling, slightly abstracting the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot progresses via tight because/therefore linkages: her plan leads directly to the Hall of Reflections, resulting in a decisive change. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear, felt cost on the page: "her own wounds remained unhealed." The final image of the shard holding light reconfigures the meaning of her journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly rendered with purposeful, sensory detail. The setting pressures choice by housing the sealed Hall of Reflections. However, while the environment is rich, it does not quite constrain a choice with tangible, physical consequence (e.g., a blocked path, a broken tool), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under the Causal lens: her unorthodox plan and infiltration of the Hall directly force the climax. The stake—redemption through proof—is clear, and the cost is legible in her bittersweet triumph and unhealed wounds, making the pressure and consequence feel earned and significant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of reimagining broken things emerges organically from the plot and the central shard motif, culminating in the resonant final image. It avoids moralizing, though the phrase "burnished sorrow" in the climax slightly leans toward thematic statement, briefly telling the emotion it should embody.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a poetic yet precise lexicon fitting a scholar. The prose rhythm is controlled, and elision (e.g., the exact method of capturing visions) is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift disrupts the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery ("shimmering ribbons," "gilded spires"). Information density is excellent. A minor rhythm plateau occurs in the second paragraph with a series of complex sentences, creating a slight deceleration before the plan is revealed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological sci-fi and a personal redemption arc feels fresh and specific. The concept of "temporal plasticity" is ingeniously integrated into the plot and setting, not just a backdrop. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final image offers a non-obvious, earned inflection.</comment>
