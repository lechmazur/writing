<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits; her spiritually curious nature drives her to the viaduct. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, slowed breath). The final choice to place the pendant is earned by prior causality, though the epiphany's cost feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; the dream incites the search, the spark discovery leads to the pendant, and the alcove scene provides decisive closure. Orientation is immediate and clear. The final image of the humming viaduct offers a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the weight of past love now carried forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The viaduct is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (wisteria scent, cool iron) and functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—the hidden compartment discovery—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Elara's artistic and spiritual perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (finding unused love). Escalation is driven by agency: discovering the spark, retrieving the pendant, following the path to the alcove. The cost is legible in the warmth and healing felt, though the final beat's emotional shift could be more viscerally rendered under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pendant and viaduct's legend, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—love stored within—that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in imagery (sparks, tear), though the final paragraph leans slightly toward assertion rather than pure implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptive texture suited to Elara's character. Diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control is strong. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Minor register elevation in climax ("wellspring") but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with strong sensory selection and varied syntax. Figurative language ("skeletal ribcage") is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("Elara’s hands trembled... She closed her eyes") but no major loops or artifacts that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "pilgrim of sparks" and the viaduct setting feel fresh and integrated. The past-life memory is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth resonates, though the healing climax leans toward familiar spiritual redemption tropes without full subversion.</comment>
