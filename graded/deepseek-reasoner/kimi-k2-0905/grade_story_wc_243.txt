<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, embodied grief ("the absence in her cuff, lighter yet heavier"). Her final choice to seal the locket is a high-stakes renunciation earned by prior causality, with visible cost. Contradictory impulses of haunted euphoria and professional care act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist's act of planting memories reconfigures the covenant's meaning. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through density of detail and the approaching demolition. The cost is legible in the final image of her empty wrist and the daughter's question.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jetty functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the archivist's professional and personal priorities ("Every salt-rimmed plank remembered the fishermen"). The environment shapes her tactics and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, with the approaching demolition and security guard creating coherent pressure that forces her final, costly act. The dominant stake (preservation) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, with the cost of her loss unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a regenerative covenant emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final waltz, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The locket's transformation from personal totem to communal artifact deepens the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. The voice is consistently lyrical yet grounded in the archivist's specific worldview. Purposeful elision (e.g., the boy's name) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("ink blooming like bruised violets"). Minor figurative strain in "gulls laughing like children who knew they were already ghosts" slightly muddles sense in a peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of a memory-archivist is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of specific, verifiable detail and emotional truth creates a singular artistic stance.</comment>
