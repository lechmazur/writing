<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the mechanical heartbeat and digital ghost metaphor. The final choice to gift the shard and walk away is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. The clerk's presence forces a stance crystallization that alters the relationship state. Minor deduction for slight diagnostic speak in "defragment myself."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: failure is redefined as a corridor, not an opposite. The inferred Accumulative lens holds, with pressure building through layered images (ink patterns, heartbeat count) that culminate in the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the porcelain shard's sharpness and the fresh ring drawn. The final image of the "dark page waiting for ink" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory and porcelain shard are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("cold air razors my new lungs"). The environment subtly guides choice, with the snow erasing footprints and the dome glinting. The shard's recurrence and tactile handling elevate it beyond ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the act of reading the ink map and choosing to enact its wisdom. The dominant stake (fetching wisdom) tightens through a meaningful cadence shift into action. Cost is legible in the slicing of the digital film and the acceptance of a continued, anomalous existence. Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in the wisdom's initial formulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from events and images, culminating in the non-literal, resonant lesson that "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor." The ink-stained shard becomes a thematic object that carries the reweighted meaning without moralizing. The final walk into the horizon offers a profound answer to the central question of how to live with contingency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by the digital ghost premise ("ride the Wi-Fi like wind"). POV is stable and the elision of the return-to-flesh mechanics is purposeful and taught. Diction and syntax are controlled and heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. The single line of dialogue is rough and unspooled, perfectly characterizing the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and legible ("snow taps the copper roof in Morse"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final sentence achieves a perfect cadence shift that supports the closure. A single, hairline instance of near-paraphrase ("fetch wisdom" / "syllable of wisdom") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the digital ghost premise with the analog observatory and ink is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotional conclusion. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry. The story possesses a singular artistic stance.</comment>
