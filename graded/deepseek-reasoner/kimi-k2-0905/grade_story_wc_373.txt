<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and contradictory, embodied in the fob digging "half-moons" into her skin. The final renunciation is earned by the father's absence, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The cost is felt on the page as she feels "lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) under a causal lens: her father's failure to appear causes her to complete the trade, irrevocably altering her understanding of their bond. The cost is legible in the "small wet click" of the recording. The lens holds tightly, with every beat linking because/therefore to this final, devastating choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The pirate market is not just atmosphere; it actively pressures the choice through its "guilty" whispers and rising tide that licks the crates. The recurring object (the fob) constrains her choice and charges the final image as it drops "like a fish gutted on deck." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: her wait, her rehearsals of betrayal, and her final decision to open her fist. The cost is unmistakable—the dissolution of the truce and the acquisition of a "silence no one could sell back." The dominant stake (trust) tightens meaningfully as the dawn approaches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of the truce and the specific action of the trade. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of corroding love through the image of "floating shine jars that looked like fallen stars." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, particularly in Jonah's calm recording.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a smuggler's daughter's bias. The voice is consistently lyrical yet grounded, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure, e.g., "Hours dilated like pupils in the dark." No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible, even in peak beats ("like a photograph of my father slipping from my locket heart"). Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic variety expertly match the scene's tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept of a "truce of hush" and a phonograph that records feelings is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the specific, verifiable detail (e.g., the widow's tear worn "like a diamond") creates undeniable authenticity of vision.</comment>
