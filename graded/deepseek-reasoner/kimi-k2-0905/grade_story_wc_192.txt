<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vividly embodied through the shadow keeper's practice of suffocation and her role as guide. The final choice to teach the boy is earned by her shared pain, with visible cost in the scar-linked ritual. A hairline slip: the diagnostic phrasing "suffocated under the weight of being loved too much" leans toward therapy-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, with the suffocation/breathing pattern intensifying to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible on-page in the boy's dissolution and her receipt of his "first real breath." The pattern is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary and doorknocker ring are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her grief. The starlight and charcoal environment subtly mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to share the ritual deepens the stakes. The cost is unmistakable in the web of light connecting their scars and the boy's dissolution. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of learning to die to live emerges organically from the suffocation/breathing pattern and the scar-linking ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of her receiving the boy's breath. It reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with the phrase "suffocated under the weight of being loved too much," slightly jarring for the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with exceptional rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost-helper learning to breathe in death is a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar material. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
