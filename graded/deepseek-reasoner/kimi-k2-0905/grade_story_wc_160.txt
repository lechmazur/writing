<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's characterization is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the faint heartbeat of magma") and a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though Corin's shift from saboteur to ally feels slightly abrupt, lacking a fully dramatized internal conflict on his part.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost felt in the final image of the gate "quivering like a held note." The surveyor's chain and volcanic breath provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcano are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The surveyor's chain functions as a micro-setting, its use evolving from a measuring tool to a bridge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mireya's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, tightening from measurement to confrontation to collaboration. The cost is legible in the final, precarious balance of the gate. The dominant stake (valley's future) is tested concretely through on-page choices with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted compassion" is fully integrated, emerging from events and reweighted at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of harmony. The alliance of fears decrypting the concept is a superb, earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature ("dormant volcano as the building breathed"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The voice is consistently poetic yet controlled, modulating with pressure without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor rhythm stumble occurs in the longer sentence describing the spectral lines, but it does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of machinist precision and geological force is original and feels inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the poetic voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
