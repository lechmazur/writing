<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, with her "chaotically precise" flaw driving the high-stakes calibration. Her motivation to become an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is dramatized through her risky choice, and her final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by the prior causality of her connection to the canyon. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "synaptic plasticity gone feral," though it is quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Earned Stasis: Mara fails to extract the dreams intact but endures with new sketches and determination to return, a foreclosed path with visible cost (blood, burned-out mirror). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density of imagery and memory until the moon's shift causes a cadence break that reweights the stakes. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is indispensable, acting as both setting and antagonist that pressures Mara's choice and supplies the memories. The broken periscope mirror constrains the action and charges the final image ("its silver burned out"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Mara's professional, "helix-minded" POV, with the environment evolving causally with the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her amplification of resonance directly triggers the rising of the "lattice of impossible engines." The cost is unmistakable: physical injury and the collapse of the nascent machines. The dominant stake (resurrecting the dreams) is tested and deepens, though the final cost is more of a lost opportunity than a permanent, irrevocable price, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of character and concept: the archaeology of light, the cost of resurrecting abandoned futures. The final image of the canyon "ready for the next dreamer" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The sketches in her pocket are a perfect thematic echo that reweights prior material without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a "helix-minded" perceptual signature that fuses technical precision and poetic lyricism ("cold fire crawled over her skull"). POV is stable and deeply embedded. The prose's rhythmic intensity modulates perfectly with the rising pressure of the ritual, and the patterned elision of the miners' memories is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and highly propulsive, with exceptional information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("scattering silver... like spilled mercury"), which, while beautiful, slightly slows the high-pressure beat. The sentence-level rhythm is masterful, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "helix-minded engineer," quantum-entangled memories, and a ritual of synaptic plasticity is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The story takes bold risks with its poetic, technical voice that heighten stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
