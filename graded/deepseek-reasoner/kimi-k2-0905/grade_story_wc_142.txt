<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's dual allegiance is a concrete, contradictory impulse that drives her choices and culminates in the collective action. Her micro-choices (painting graffiti, telling stories to children) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final endurance is earned by her prior causality, with the cost felt in the necklace "thumping against her heart."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the city's reorganization is a decisive change that reweights options, with cost legible in Lina's knowledge that "privatization had merely been postponed." The pattern of resistance (graffiti, tilted city story) is taught early and pays off. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The raft-city setting is indispensable, pressuring every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("popcorn smoke," "gaslight"). The foundation stone chip and graffiti function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and reconfigure meaning. The environment evolves causally with the night's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Lina's call to debate forces a collective tightening that narrows options. The stake (survival vs. authenticity) is signaled early and deepens. The cost is visible in the inspectors' retreat and Lina's acknowledgment of a temporary victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between authenticity and commodification. The final image of the carnival as "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Subtext operates powerfully in the graffiti symbols and reorganized spaces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices"). The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in Lina's perspective. Purposeful compression and lyrical density are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a single phrase ("投射的火花") introduces a slight register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, and the final paragraph's cadence is perfectly weighted for closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating carnival with a gentrification narrative is fresh and specific. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking—lyrical density, encoded graffiti—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications.</comment>
