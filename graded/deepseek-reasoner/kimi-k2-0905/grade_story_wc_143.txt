<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inspector’s purposefully curious nature is embodied through specific, costly choices (grinding the sand grain, setting chemical alarms). Her emotional crack when speaking to "ghosts of engineers" reveals layered motivation, and the final act of witnessing as resistance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through the dual chemical timers. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final photograph captures the "only color left," with cost legible in the fossilized imprint and the completed reaction. The ending reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar summit is a pressure cooker: vitrified regolith, terminator wind, and UV threat constrain tactics. The feldspar vein and basalt shard are micro-settings that alter choices. Earth’s glow charges the final image, and sensory details (crystalline clicks, electrostatic whispers) are purposefully selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: document extinction before UV bleach. Escalation is driven by the chemical timers narrowing the window. Agency is demonstrated in the inspector’s deliberate waiting and shutter decisions. Cost is unmistakable as anemones fossilize and the grain flushes crimson, foreclosing all options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the stolen sand grain weighs "heavier than history," and curiosity as mourning is explored without statement. The final image of the fossil and photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory and loss, reweighting the hourglass motif without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical yet precise perceptual signature ("anticipatory phosphorescence," "soft crystalline clicks"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision (e.g., the unresolved contract) is purposeful. No head-hopping; voice remains cohesive under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("like letters never meant to be mailed") is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Momentum is sustained through selective sensory detail and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lunar biology, chemical timing, and existential curation. The sand grain timer is a non-obvious, irreplaceable element that heightens stakes. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off with closure, and the concept commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
