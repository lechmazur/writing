<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, purposefully curious trait that intensifies under pressure. The final choice to photograph is a micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Embodied emotion is concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final endurance is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost in the final fossil image. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. The chemical timer provides a coherent, taught pattern that pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lunar summit is not just described but actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (feldspar vein, terminator wind). The environment and the chemical grain constrain choice and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the inspector's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (documenting extinction) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, using the chemical timer to create palpable time pressure. The cost is legible on the page in the final, irreversible closure of the anemones and the completed reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A coherent theme of mourning and witness emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The final image of the fossil offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates powerfully in the anemones' movements and the inspector's realization about curiosity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's perspective. Purposeful elision (e.g., the specific reactants) is taught and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. There is a near-total absence of loops, scaffold, or repetitive phrasing. The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates with the closing of the anemones.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of documenting a lunar extinction is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific combination of elements (chemical timer, antique camera, hourglass sand) is organic and highly irreplaceable. Bold risk-taking in the poetic voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
