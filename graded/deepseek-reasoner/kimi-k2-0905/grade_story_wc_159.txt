<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role and personal history, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her internal conflict is concrete, embodied in the foxglove heart and the memory of Por. The final choice of self-sacrifice is earned by the systematic payment of memories, with visible cost. However, some interiority leans slightly toward the diagnostic ("shaped like a foxglove, closed in regret") rather than fully embodied action in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the caretaker becomes the final extinct feeling, redefining the cost of preservation. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the systematic payment of memories. Causality is tight; each action leads to the next required payment. The cost is unmistakably legible on the page as Lira hollows into a "translucent silhouette."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The opal library, chandelier, and drawers of emotion are not just backdrop but resources and obstacles that shape Lira's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through her professional priorities. The museum itself is a character, its fate tied directly to Lira's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with each name saved demanding a greater personal cost. The dominant stake (preservation of memory) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as she pays with her own memories. The cost is visceral and legible as she becomes "weightless" and "hollow." The chandelier's demand for payment is a persistent constraint that shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: preservation requires sacrifice, and the rememberer must be forgotten. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the act of remembrance itself. Subtext operates powerfully in the charged imagery (foxglove heart, glass-orchid petals). The piece avoids moralizing, embracing the complex, bittersweet cost of its central idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply fused with Lira's perceptual signature. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with rhythm modulating perfectly with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "Por— the last cracked, unfinished") are taught and pay off. There is no head-hopping; the entire narrative is filtered through her specific, desperate consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor instance of potential register drift occurs with "foxglove regret sweet on her tongue," which slightly elevates diction at the peak beat. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with the payment of memories. There are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singularly original and ingenious synthesis of concept, character, and plot. The combination of a "museum of extinct feelings" with a "glass-orchid caretaker" is fresh and non-obvious, executed with full commitment to its implications. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in Lira's sacrifice. The final image is both inevitable and breathtakingly inventive.</comment>
