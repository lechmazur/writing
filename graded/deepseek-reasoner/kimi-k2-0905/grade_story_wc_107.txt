<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with her grief and need for "safe zones" filtering every action. Her final choice to leave the dome is a decisive, earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost, realigning her "fault lines of sorrow." The only minor deduction is for a slight abstraction in the final emotional state ("emotional tectonic shift").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Mara's stance crystallizes through layered sensory and symbolic accumulation, culminating in the decision to leave the dome—a choice that reconfigures the space and her purpose with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost ("a core sample of human hope frozen and released"). The lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (chair for fuel, tape for seams). The "micro-setting" of the bookmark and the control room console constrains choices and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, reflecting Mara's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, building through her narrated actions and the external pressure of the thaw. The cost is legible in her final renunciation and the physical act of leaving the sanctuary behind. A single, meaningful deepening—the realization that safe zones "belong wherever they are needed"—reweights the dominant stake perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image (thaw, dome, bookmark) and action (crafting, narrating, abandoning). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of sheltering fragility without stating a moral. The final invitation—“Enter, wonder, argue, forgive”—synthesizes the thematic complexity without resorting to summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Mara's glassblower's perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with her emotional intensity. Her act of "dramatically narrating" is a brilliant, voice-motivated device that is taught early and pays off at closure, fully integrating her internal state with the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a single instance of potential register drift ("emotional tectonic shift") which, while apt, momentarily leans toward abstraction in an otherwise impeccably embodied peak beat. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a contemplative glassblower in a thawing control room is a fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable combination. The core concept of crafting "safe zones for inquiry" is executed with full commitment, transforming the setting and objects into a singular artistic vision. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
