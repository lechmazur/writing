<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("its fracture edges warm as if remembering light"). The final choice to become the new prism is earned by prior causality and the mother's legacy. A micro-choice under pressure—prying the shard from the skeleton—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the reignited lamp reweights the premise from desolation to hope, with cost legible in the final image of her standing with "arms open." The causal lens holds tightly from the inciting incident (the prism's call) to the climax (finding the shard). The orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The glass humming pavilion's "single note" and the desert's muteness after retrieving the shard actively pressure the protagonist's actions. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her retrocognitive perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (proving meaning through light) tightens with the discovery of the missing shard, forcing a perilous journey into the desert. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the mute desert and the child's skeleton.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of meaning. The final realization—"that her mother’s death, the child’s walk, her own return were not accidents but refractions of one intention"—reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her retrocognition. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression ("hope in the shape of ribs") and patterned diction are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and coherent ("a moan between mourning and morning"). Rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. The final line is a masterful image that resolves the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, retrocognition, and a quest for meaning through starlight is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, non-linear structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally resonant conclusion.</comment>
