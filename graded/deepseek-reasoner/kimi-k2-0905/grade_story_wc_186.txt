<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply integrated with the retrocognition trait, which constrains choices and charges the final image. The custodian's motivation to prove meaning in coincidence is dramatized through her arduous journey, and her final stance crystallization is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("hope in the shape of ribs").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through pattern and cadence shifts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) that lands with undeniable cost and reweights the premise, making the protagonist "the new prism." The child's skeleton discovery is a meaningful, earned tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The glass humming pavilion, the prism, and the desert environment are tactile and pressure-applying. Sensory hierarchy is perfect, narrowing to immediacies in crisis ("pulse counting every mistake").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (rekindling for meaning) is tested by the missing shard, forcing a costly, dangerous quest. The cost is legible on the page in the child's skeleton and the desert's muteness, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the prism, the stars, the child's walk—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final realization that events are "refractions of one intention" reweights all prior material without moralizing, offering profound, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, perceptually specific signature that modulates with pressure without losing coherence. The retrocognitive spills are anchored in concrete cues ("let retrocognition spill like hot metal"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("a moan between mourning and morning"). Rhythm and syntax accelerate and breathe with scene needs, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, retrocognition, and celestial navigation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
