<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ansel's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. His final choice to store wonder is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sealing of the cellar door. The trait "peripherally focused" is dramatized through his observational method, not merely stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Ansel chooses to store wonder, not kill it, with the cost felt in the final image of him listening to the house tick. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through the pattern of reflections and echoes until the final, decisive reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, functioning as both setting and mechanism that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the environment guiding Ansel's discovery through its reflective properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ansel's agency under the accumulative lens, his reverse-engineering tightening options until the final, costly choice. The dominant stake (restoring time) is signaled early and paid for with the loss of the echoes and the sealing of the artifact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept, offering a resonant, non-literal exploration of wonder and reason through the particular metaphor of harvested echoes. The final image of "every sound circles back thinner" reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits masterful control, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating the beat without muddle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of harvesting echoes is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical density that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
