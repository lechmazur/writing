<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory ("confidently uncertain"), with micro-choices under pressure (unbending the event) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance of uncertainty is earned by prior causality, though the mentor's memory feels slightly detached from the immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where uncertainty becomes the "truest coordinate," reconfiguring meaning with a felt cost (power dims, gravity slackens). The pattern of editing history is taught early and pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and pen are not just described but actively pressure choices and charge the final image ("anomaly hummed a lullaby"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional bias ("feeling the gravitational anomaly tug at her bones").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens; her decision to unbend the event tightens options and forces a trade-off (power dims). The cost is legible but could be slightly more visceral; the stakes (cosmic misunderstanding) are weighty and interwoven with internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—error as fertilizer for clarity—offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image ("history would remember itself slightly differently") reprices the premise with conceptual cost, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a strong perceptual signature ("static a necessary fertilizer"). Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("confidently uncertain" leans slightly diagnostic), but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional over-writing ("confidently uncertain" as a label) slightly dulls immediacy. Rhythm is controlled and varies with scene needs, but a few mixed metaphors ("pre-threshed and nonsensical") create minor muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and literary concepts feels inevitable. The core premise of editing history through contingent relationships is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
