<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("his throat tightened"). The final choice to crush the pocket-sun is a decisive change earned by his seven-year struggle and the confession to Mira, with visible cost in the transformed shell. A minor deduction for a moment of abstract articulation ("scientifically romantic paradox") that briefly flirts with diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the transformed shell reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through emotional and thematic density. The piece passes the Orientation Test immediately, anchoring character, setting, and stakes within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ember nexus and nautilus shell are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The volcanic glass "beneath his boots" and the shell's spiral "catching the dying light" are purpose-driven, tactile details integrated into action. Sensory selection is masterful, reflecting the POV's urgency and professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from internal conflict to a shared, decisive act. The dominant stake (understanding presence) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens through Mira's arrival and their exchange. The cost is legible on the page in the crushed pocket-sun and the transformed, weighted shell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of presence vs. absence emerges organically from the core conflict and is resolved through the potent, non-literal final image. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as Mira's "deliberate accident" of brushing his fingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exceptional, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that heightens pressure ("time behaves differently—stretching elastic as caramel"). POV is stable and deeply embodied. The elision of what Mira whispers is a purposeful, taught pattern that pays off by charging the object and the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is pristine, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and consistent ("voice cracking like cooling magma"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's emotional needs. The final line is a perfectly cadenced resolution that recharges the core motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—an alchemist who sells captured light—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat. The combination of scientific and romantic language is organic and specific, not a checklist. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
