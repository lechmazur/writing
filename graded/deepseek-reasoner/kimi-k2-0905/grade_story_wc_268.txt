<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The titan's motivation ("precision" over "revenge") is clear and consistent, rooted in his sworn duty to balance. His "regally unpretentious" air is shown through action. A minor deduction for interiority that, while concrete, could reveal more contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the glamour sundered) with clear, felt cost (the man's visage melting into a stranger's). The causal lens holds: the titan's clues lead the pretender to the codex, and his final action with the ink pellet directly causes the unmasking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is not just a backdrop; it actively constrains and enables the titan's actions (creeping along balustrades, the spiral carrel). The iron gall ink pellet is a micro-setting object that charges the final image and is indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the titan's agency: his cryptic messages bait the pretender, and his final descent and whisper provide the crucial second clue. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the pretender's enchanted identity unravels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (truth, illusion, balance) emerges organically from the central conflict and the resonant final image of the dissolving coronet. The final message offers a non-literal, profound answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through the titan's perceptive, ancient consciousness. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, mythic rhythm that modulates beautifully with the action ("voice calm as closed winter").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush, precise, and highly atmospheric with excellent rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the peak beat ("voice calm as closed winter" feels slightly elevated for the POV), but it does not obscure clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a diminutive titan, a library setting, and a magical ink pellet as the weapon feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high coherence, transforming familiar tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
