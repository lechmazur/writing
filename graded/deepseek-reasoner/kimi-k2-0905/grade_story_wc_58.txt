<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is profound and flawlessly executed. The traveler's internal contradiction—writing obituaries to understand healing while fleeing her own grief—is dramatized through concrete action (the unmaking with the thread). Her final micro-choice to plant the thread and walk away is earned by the prior causality of her self-recognition, with visible cost in her aching joints and empty notebook.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Structure is a masterful single-scene causal chain driven by the protagonist's intimate action. The inferred lens is Causal: each step (arrival, kneeling, projecting, recognizing herself) is a therefore linkage. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the planted thread redefines "explained absences" as "presences waiting to be recognized," with undeniable conceptual cost legible in the empty notebook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The autumn garden is not a backdrop but an active participant that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "paths where fallen leaves had arranged themselves into patterns" directly mirrors her work and later becomes the medium for the spelled-out words, making the setting indispensable to the closure's meaning and mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (understanding healing through absences) tightens meaningfully with each turn of the thread, culminating in the irreversible, costly act of projecting her own absence and choosing to return to the world. The cost is unmistakable in the physical ache and the relinquishing of her defining trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme—that healing is the courage to be witnessed, and absences are potential presences—is an organic, non-literal emergence from the core action. It avoids moralizing; the final answer is a resonant image (the planted seed, the spelled paths) that reweights everything prior without stating a thesis. The emotional aftereffect is profound and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("autumn light filtered through bare branches like pale fingers"). POV is stable and deeply internal. The only minor deduction is for a slight register elevation in the final paragraph's thematic summation, though it remains character-bound and does not constitute head-hopping or a clarity break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single, hairline slip occurs: the phrase "geography of healing" is repeated several times, bordering on a lyric refrain but slightly risking conceptual redundancy. However, it is a core concept and its repetition is purposeful, not a scaffold loop, and it does not obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of obituary writing, a magical thread, and a metaphysical garden is wholly original, organic, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The risk-taking—a quiet, internal climax—heightens stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
