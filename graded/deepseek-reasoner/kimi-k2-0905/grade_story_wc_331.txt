<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Calla's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final choice to release the scarf is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Minor lack of internal contradiction in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) that reweights the premise of stories as resonance, with cost legible in the scarf's tear and release. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with pattern taught early. The graduate student beat slightly slows momentum but ties back thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice, while the hyperbolic geometry charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Calla's professional POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent even during the warping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Calla's agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through the geometry's warp. The cost is unmistakable in the scarf's destruction and release of overdue hours. The dominant stake (finding where stories live) is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about stories as witnessed resonance. Subtext operates richly in gesture and implication. Avoids moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, though a few complex metaphors may require rereading. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately with the warping geometry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific poetry and hyperbolic geometry feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
