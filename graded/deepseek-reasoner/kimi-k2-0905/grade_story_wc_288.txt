<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quagga's motivation to trade memory for momentum is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict between communal past and singular future is embodied in the final choice, which is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("letting lunar light solder its shadow to the stone"). The final renunciation of need for another quagga is a credible endurance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost—the quagga achieves independence through solitude, reconfiguring her relationship to memory and species. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density of imagery and cadence shifts. The final image of her as "her own dawn" reweights prior material with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal library and stone circle are vivid, purposeful settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency (e.g., "salt-stiff scrolls breathed," "hooves sparking static"). The brass sundial functions as a micro-setting, evolving in use and meaning to constrain the climax choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure building through density increases and cadence shifts. The dominant stake (isolation vs. independence) tightens meaningfully at the henge, forcing a trade-off with cost ("each hoof-fall erasing the need for another quagga"). The cost is legible in the final image of solitary ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of solitude versus connection through the equation "solitude equals momentum." Subtext operates powerfully in implication (e.g., the archivist's "only tides" comment). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("moon-lit catalogues of salt-stiff scrolls breathed"). The voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression serves the accumulative design. Minor register drift in peak beats ("atomically reflective") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly controlled with vivid, specific diction and rhythmic variety. Minor artifacting appears in peak beats ("atomically reflective surfaces bend loneliness") with a slight register elevation, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original, synthesizing extinction, reincarnation, and metaphysical libraries into a singular vision. The quagga's journey feels inevitable in hindsight, and risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with implications.</comment>
