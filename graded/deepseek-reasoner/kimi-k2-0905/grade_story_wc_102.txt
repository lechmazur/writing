<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the chest fracture imagery. The final choice to distribute love is earned by the prior causality of her memory and the shared breath ritual. The man's matching tremor creates a credible crucible relationship that forces her stance change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory density and breath pattern shifts toward the resonant reconfiguration of the wisteria door. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the vanished camera leaving an "afterimage on the stone"—and the persistent constraint of breath as reciprocal duty shapes the entire final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The viaduct and wisteria function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is exceptionally vivid and purposeful ("each breath she took tasted purple"), with the environment directly enabling the transformative action. The camera obscura is a tool that actively projects the crucial image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through the breathing ritual and bead offering. The dominant stake of unused love tightens meaningfully through the projected image change and the door's appearance. Cost is legible in the knitted fracture and the vanished camera, with the final distribution representing a clear price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action rather than statement. The final orchard image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of stored love. The conceptual repricing of storage as "a posture" lands with profound emotional honesty without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("petals drifting like slow fireworks"). The lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Voice modulation under pressure is exceptional, particularly in the breath-matched rhythm section. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythm and information density, though slight overwriting risk appears in "foggy lucidity made fruit flesh." No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful throughout, even in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of spiritual curiosity, camera obscura, and breathing mechanics feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept transforms familiar material through specific, grounded choices in character perception and ritual action.</comment>
