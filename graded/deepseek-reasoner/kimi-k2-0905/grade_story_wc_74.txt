<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia is a concrete, embodied trait that drives her nocturnal quest. Her motivation to "coax out" a lost language is clear, rooted in her established belief system, and intensifies under the pressure of the moon's influence. The final choice to cap the brush and accept her fatigue is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable, foreclosing the path of endless painting with a visible cost of exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through the density of sensory and visionary details. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira completes her task and finds rest, with the cost of her exhaustion and the brush's dimming felt on the page. The structure is a single, coherent scene that builds to a decisive, quiet culmination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is a micro-setting that actively pressures the narrative, constraining the action to a single, potent location and supplying the key resources (moonlight, plants, mirror). Sensory detail is exquisite, purposeful, and filtered through Mira's artistic POV. The environment is inextricable from the central conflict and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—coaxing out the lost language—is signaled early and escalates through the thickening air and the brush's glowing. The pressure is accumulative, driven by Mira's agency, and culminates in the realization the mural is "for lungs." The cost is the physical and emotional expenditure of her insomnia, made legible in her final fatigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action: lost kindness and connection are recovered through art. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "green prints on the pavement like breadcrumbs," reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The concept of lost languages is fully integrated into the thematic exploration of memory and empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's poetic, artistic consciousness. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with syntax that beautifully modulates with the rising intensity of the vision. The brief dialogue with Jules is handled through subtext and gesture, perfectly in keeping with the tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and rarely muddled. A minor deduction for a slight risk of over-decoration in peak beats (e.g., "saffron quiet," "indigo steam"), though the clarity of the closure image remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of an insomniac painter, a magical brush, and lost languages is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is executed with full commitment, and the quiet, lyrical risk-taking heightens the stakes without obscuring clarity. The story possesses a singular, authentic artistic vision.</comment>
