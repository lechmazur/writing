<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia and artistic obsession are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices (e.g., sprinkling turmeric, setting the mirror) that compel higher-stakes choices. Her final renunciation of fatigue is earned by the causality of the painting's completion, with visible cost in her exhaustion and the changed city. The brief appearance of Jules is choreographed cleanly and applies immediate, silent pressure that deepens the thematic resonance without headcount penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s effect redefines the city’s reality, with cost legible in the "gentle curve that meant 'remember me kindly'." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through density of imagery and a cadence shift into communal exhalation. The pattern is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost, transforming the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is indispensable, pressuring the choice to paint and charging the final image as a "lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood." Sensory detail is intensely selective and purposeful (e.g., "peat and saffron quiet," "indigo steam"), filtered through Mira's artistic POV. The environment constrains and enables the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering and tightening through the brush’s autonomous movement and the air thickening "like the inside of a throat." The cost is unmistakable in her fatigue becoming "a blanket rather than a blade" and the communal transformation. A single, profound deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of lost kindness and collective memory emerges entirely through events and images, not statement. The final image of marigolds on windshields is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, particularly in Jules’s wordless participation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature in the lyrical, art-filtered prose ("saffron quiet," "bruised marigolds"). The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence, and the patterned elision (e.g., the brush moving "without her") is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor artifact exists ("sour glow" slightly strains the olfactory metaphor). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; the final paragraph’s cadence is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomniac artist, lost languages, and communal healing feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the brush’s lore and the mural’s mechanics. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
