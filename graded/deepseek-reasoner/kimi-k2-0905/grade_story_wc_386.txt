<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization is precise and compelling, with her "truth weaving" trait constraining choices and her final unguarded smile feeling earned. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though a few phrases like "collective sorrow" edge toward abstraction under pressure. The resolution—carrying the knowledge that wreckage cradles light—is a credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern taught early and closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the mirror and future self reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is deliberately disoriented but pays off at closure, waiving the penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The glacial shrine functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the finale. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("borrowed starlight," "glacier groaned like a sleeping whale"), integrated into action and perception. The snow globe and ice mirror constrain tactics and reconfigure meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marrow's agency under the accumulative lens, with each candle reveal deepening stakes and narrowing options. Cost is legible when the glacier cracks and she tows the globe upward, foreclosing other paths. The dominant stake (salvaging purity) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, resisting moralizing. The final answer—that wreckage cradles light—is resonant and non-literal, reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the passengers dissolving into glitter, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that remains coherent under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off. No head-hopping; POV is stable and apt. Minor register drift in phrases like "planetarium of collective sorrow" slightly tempers the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, slight overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "planetarium of collective sorrow" introduces a mixed metaphor). No loops or scaffolding, but this figurative muddle prevents a 9+ score despite otherwise exceptional craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost whispering, glacial wreck-diving, and dream logic feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, resisting template plots.</comment>
