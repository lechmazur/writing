<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization is concrete and specific, with embodied emotion ("pressing her palms against ice walls until skin stuck") and a clear, consistent motivation to salvage something pure. Her final choice to leave the mirror is a credible renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost, earned by prior causality. The trait of weaving truth carefully is dramatized, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the mirror and the knowledge that "even wreckage can cradle light" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of dream-cameos and windows is taught early and pays off cohesively. Orientation is deliberately disoriented initially but proves functional, serving the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The glacial setting is not merely vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The ice walls, the sphere of unfrozen water, and the melted snow globe itself are micro-settings that pressure Marrow's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional perspective as a diver ("the glacier groaned like a sleeping whale").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marrow's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her decision to spend three nights in the shrine and follow the memory-jellyfish deepens the stakes and narrows her options. The cost is legible on the page in the glacier's crack and the subsequent dissolution of the passengers, charging the final image with the price of her retrieval.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the wreck and the ghosts, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of salvage and memory. The final image of the mirror and the knowledge that "wreckage can cradle light" offers a profound thematic resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains controlled under pressure. The prose is purposefully compressed and patterned ("borrowed starlight," "windows of connection"), and this elision is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marrow's specific, professional worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences that advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles in peak beats. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, anchoring voice and resolving with a recharged motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of deep-sea diving, ghost whispering, and glacial archaeology. The core concept of "windows of connection" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The risk-taking in its lyric, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
