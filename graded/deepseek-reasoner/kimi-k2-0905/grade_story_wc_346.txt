<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure. The final sacrifice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, though a brief moment of abstract phrasing ("bruised awe") slightly tempers the peak emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pane's transformation and time's reversal are legible and charged by prior pattern-building. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse, pane, and puppet function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's urgency, with the environment actively shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with each lullaby iteration tightening pressure and narrowing options. The cost of her eternal whispering is legible and scales to the stake, foreclosing a path with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to imperfection and sacrifice, reweighting prior material without statement. The final thought on "cracked mouth" and "vowels of mercy" is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by urgency and memory. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Minor density in peak beats does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, without loops or scaffold. Read-aloud quality supports the accumulative drive, though one complex metaphor ("tongue probing a sore tooth") briefly stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of doomsday tropes through specific, grounded choices. The pane of hush and nested lullabies feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure commits fully to its premise.</comment>
