<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her search for her mother's lost song. Her "spatially imaginative mind" is not just a label but a trait that actively filters her perception of the setting, and her final choice to rewrite the film is a decisive, earned change. The emotional cost of her quest is felt throughout, culminating in the warmth spreading to her fingertips, a perfect embodiment of her internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of the letter turning into film and threading into Mara's chest is a decisive, conceptual repricing of "unused love" with undeniable cost. Causality is tight; every beat accumulates emotional and thematic pressure toward this transformative ending. The film moving on its own is the only minor, fantastical convenience, but it serves the closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace is not just a backdrop but a vital, pressure-exerting character. The projection booth, the dusty reels, and the silver screen directly constrain and enable Mara's choices, most critically when she uses the crystal shard to scratch new lyrics onto the film. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through Mara's professional and emotional priorities, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens. The stake—finding the lyrics to complete her mother's message—is signaled immediately and deepens with each vision. The cost is legible on the page: the emotional weight of discovering her mother's unused love and the physical act of rewriting the film to release it. The final, tangible discovery of the cigarette case is the earned payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "unused love" and its storage/transmission is fully integrated into the narrative's fabric, emerging through concrete action and image rather than statement. The core concept is answered resonantly and non-literally by the final image and her mother's postscript: "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it." This avoids moralizing, offering a complex, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, slightly archaic rhythm that perfectly suits the setting and Mara's vocation. The POV is stable and deeply embedded in her consciousness. The prose's perceptual signature—noticing "dust floated like slow film frames"—is consistent and character-specific, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary. The prose is dense and lyrical yet maintains perfect clarity and propulsion. Sentences are varied and rhythmic, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The final paragraph is a masterclass in cadence and closure, with the "pigeons that fluttered like white sprocket holes" serving as a flawless, integrated image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, vintage cinema, and a personal quest for a lost song is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail, not quirky ornamentation. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, supporting the closure without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
