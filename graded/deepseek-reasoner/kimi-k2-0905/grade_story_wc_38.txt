<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is vivid and specific, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to swallow the page is earned by prior causality, though a hint more contradictory impulse in the climax could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (vulnerability as strength) with clear cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the spider web timeframe, while slightly underutilized, does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the textural lens, with the dice roll and subsequent vortex providing a meaningful, cost-laden tightening. The dominant stake (liberating the data) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of encrypted vulnerability emerges organically from the particulars of the plot and culminates in a resonant, non-literal final image. The concept is fully integrated and avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent lyrical-perceptual signature. The POV is stable and the elision (e.g., the scientists' exact method) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, serving pressure. A single minor repetition ("drowned") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking, dance, and a sunken lab is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully, and the risk-taking with a highly lyrical style pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
