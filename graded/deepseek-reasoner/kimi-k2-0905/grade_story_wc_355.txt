<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mirelle’s characterization is flawlessly integrated, with her pacifism and eclectic nature embodied in concrete details like "velvet patches over bullet holes." Her internal conflict is dramatized through her mission to catalog silence, and her final choice to leave the clasp unlocked is a profound, earned renunciation that reconfigures her relationship to memory and empathy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens is masterfully held, building through sequenced silences toward a decisive conceptual repricing. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the clasp transforms from a lock to a "tuning fork shaped like a question," landing with immense conceptual cost and reweighting all prior material. The structure is taut and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's choices, its contents ("broken music boxes," "cracked crystal radio") charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Mirelle's specific perception ("cedar smelled like truce, iron like surrender"), making the environment a crucible for the thematic action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Mirelle's agency in tuning the radio, each twist of the dial a conscious choice that deepens the stakes and narrows her focus. The cost is legible in her tears and the final, hard-won realization, all under the intense pressure of the impending fireworks, which provides a coherent situational clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's specific actions, avoiding direct statement. The final, resonant image of the clasp as a "lighthouse for anyone learning the path to empathy" is a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative, transforming the concept of silence from something kept to something shared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mirelle's distinctive, poetic perception, creating a powerful perceptual signature. The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, with a controlled rhythm that modulates perfectly with the story's emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, original metaphors ("fireworks stitched bright scars across the sky"). A minor risk of figurative density exists in peak beats but does not obscure clarity or causality. The sentence-level rhythm is masterful and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept of tuning frequencies to hear silence is a breathtakingly original and non-obvious synthesis. It feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its implications, transforming the familiar trope of a recovered object into a profound meditation on memory, war, and empathy.</comment>
