<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirelle's characterization is exceptional, with her pacifism and empathy driving concrete, high-stakes choices under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied in her careful, non-violent methods, and her final choice to sing back at the diary's frequency is a profound, earned renunciation that carries visible cost. The moment she becomes "a walking archive of silences" crystallizes her meaningful change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds perfectly, building pressure through the layered discovery of silences until the resonant reconfiguration at 714 kHz. Closure is a decisive, earned change—the clasp sighing open—with clear cost: Mirelle's vow to carry the record in her "bloodstream." The structure is taut, with each frequency shift escalating stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop and crystal radio are not just vivid but actively constrain and enable Mirelle's choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her specific goal. The environment evolves with the action, most notably when the "shadows leaned inward" at the key frequency, heightening pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven masterfully by Mirelle's agency under the Accumulative lens, as each tuned frequency deepens the stakes and narrows her options. The cost is legible on the page when she lets the final silence "inhabit her." The dominant stake—recovering the diary's story—is tested and transformed through her empathetic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of empathetic resonance, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the question of how to hear silence, reweighting prior material through the mirror and poppy. The final image of Mirelle's body as a "walking archive" provides resonant thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that remains stable under pressure. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with the emotional intensity of the discovery. Purposeful elision (e.g., the diary's entries felt, not read) is taught and pays off at closure, enriching the narrative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is nearly flawless, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens clarity, as in "the petals of nothing would not bruge." Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with the tuning and breathing at the climax. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, synthesizing the concept of silence-as-frequency with pacifism in a fresh, non-obvious way. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking—lyricism, accumulated silences—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific, grounded choices in character and world make the combination organic and memorable.</comment>
