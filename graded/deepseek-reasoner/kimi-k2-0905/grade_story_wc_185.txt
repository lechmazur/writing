<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her tactile reading of ice and stone. A credible endurance is earned, though Jalen feels slightly less dimensional, serving more as a functional pressure source than a fully realized crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) via the final, silent sigh that releases meaning, landing with undeniable conceptual cost. The hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens holds, with each beat narrowing options toward the dome confrontation. The persistent constraint of silence shapes every tactic, and the orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not just a backdrop but the central antagonist and resource, actively pressuring choices (e.g., stalactites that chime, the dome's skin). The echo chamber stone and ice shard function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's urgent, professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, moving from augury to active, dangerous inscription in the dome. The cost is legible in the beings' dimming and the stone's final crack. The dominant stake (preserving stories) is tested and paid for on the page, forcing a trade-off that forecloses the path of continued hiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between silence and story, memory and loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the whispered "We were here" and the silent tide of meaning. It reweights the premise, proving survival is not just silence but the preservation of voice, even without sound. Avoids moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the mapkeeper's professional, tactile perception. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical yet precise rhythm that modulates with pressure ("hammered repose"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the Warden's non-verbal communication) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though a few complex sentences risk slight muddle (e.g., "marrow threatening to become melody"). Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating tension. No loops, scaffold, or figurative confusion. The final line is a masterful, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of familiar elements (post-apocalyptic, silence) into a fresh, specific world governed by sound. The core concept (bloom of hush) is ingenious and indispensable. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical climax heightens stakes and coherence. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
