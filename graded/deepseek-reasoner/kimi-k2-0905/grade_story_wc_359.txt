<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character is defined through concrete synesthetic perception and high-stakes choice under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied ("tasted winter mint"). The final endurance (cracked bell) carries cost, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the wait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost ("cracked but luminous"). The simultaneity mechanism is taught early and pays off cleanly at the climax, though the bedrock sigh's arrival feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The ice cavern pressures tactics (aurora under ice, refracted light) and the glacier itself is a key actor. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Timeframe escalates pressure coherently under the accumulative lens, forcing a single decisive tightening. The cost of mistiming is clear and the protagonist's agency in striking through the "green-gold veil" drives the resolution with visible price (cracked bell).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central act; the certification of wonder is a non-literal answer that reweights the world without moralizing. The final image of earth humming through aurora colors offers resonant, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a rich perceptual signature. The synesthetic filter is consistent and purpose-driven. Some minor register elevation ("unfetter wonder itself") exists but does not break voice or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor density issues appear in peak beats (e.g., "cathedral whose pillars were frozen chords" slightly stacks metaphor) but clarity and momentum are maintained, and closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is strikingly original and fully committed. The synthesis of synesthesia, glacial setting, and metaphysical stakes feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
