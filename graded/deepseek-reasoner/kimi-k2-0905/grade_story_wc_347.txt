<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory feelings (hatred of the orchard vs. duty to guide) are embodied and drive micro-choices like spitting the nut-kernel. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle against the curse. The final endurance is an Earned Stasis with a visible cost, though her core motivation remains slightly abstract beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through the ticking clock and sensory density. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, crystallized in the final image of the orchard keeping her prisoner. The cost is legible on the page in the "long walk back" and the "crystal fossils" sealing her efforts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in economical, pressure-driven detail. The labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost are not just atmospheric but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is impeccable, narrowing to the "clicking" of wings and "frost-brittle grass" to reflect urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the tightening timeframe and Mara's increasingly desperate tactics, culminating in the risky handprint. Agency is clear in her choice to use the nut, a tangible cost that alters her options. The dominant stake of saving the travelers is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of duty as a "graceless beauty" emerges organically from the core conflict and the final image of cyclical sacrifice. It resists a tidy moral, embracing the complexity of her trapped existence. The subtext in the orchard's "silent accusation" is powerful, though the theme could be slightly more textured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a percussive, metallic rhythm that mirrors the setting ("brass wings clicking like metronomes"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perception. The prose is a character in itself, with every syntactic choice feeling motivated by her state and the world's logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is nearly flawless. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is zero scaffolding or looped phrasing. Figurative language is sharp, consistent, and deeply integrated ("wings folding like prayers nobody taught them").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mechanical labyrinth, a cursed orchard, and a voiceless guide feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is committed to fully, with the rules of the curse and the nut's power shaping every beat. It avoids genre clichés through its specific, melancholy execution and emotional honesty.</comment>
