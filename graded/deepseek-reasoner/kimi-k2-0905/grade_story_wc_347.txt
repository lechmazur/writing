<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—hatred of the orchard versus her duty to guide—are embodied in concrete micro-choices, such as crushing the nut to create a final, desperate handprint. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle against the curse and clock. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her perpetual imprisonment felt in the final walk back.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and the tightening timeframe. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the cost of Mara's endless duty made legible in the final image of her walking back to the orchard. The pattern of warmth-ghosts and the nut's blueprint are taught early and pay off decisively at the climax, shaping the travelers' final, successful turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice: the labyrinth and mechanical birds pressure Mara's tactics, and the cliff's edge physically prevents her from entering. The recurring nut object charges the final image and is used to create the climactic handprint. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara's professional urgency, such as the frost forming "like tiny white nooses."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the ticking clock and the travelers' progression through the labyrinth's junctions. Mara's agency is a series of renunciations and endurance, culminating in the costly, irreversible act of destroying the nut to create the final guide. The dominant stake (saving the travelers) is tested and narrowed at each beat, with the cost of her action (losing the nut) altering her own future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of duty without love, resisting tidy resolution. The final image of "graceless beauty" and Mara's walk back to her prison offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central tension. The nut and the orchard are potent motifs that shift meaning, from a mother's last gift to a tool of sacrifice, deepening the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in descriptions like "brass wings clicking like metronomes." The voice modulates with pressure, compressing into urgent, tactile actions ("spat the nut-kernel onto her glove, crushed it") at the climax. Purposeful elision (Mara's lost voice) is taught early and pays off, charging her silent communication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety that accelerates with the ticking clock. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("frost began to lace the grass blades like tiny white nooses"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully reinforces the theme of cyclical duty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mechanical labyrinth, a silent protagonist, and a organic, cursed orchard feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a "forgotten blueprint" is transformed from a literal map into a thematic anchor for duty and sacrifice. Risk-taking in the quiet, stasis-based closure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, fully committing to the story's singular artistic vision.</comment>
