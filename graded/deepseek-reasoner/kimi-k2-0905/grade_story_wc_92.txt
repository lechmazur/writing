<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Garnet's internal "cradle of sparks" is a concrete, character-specific motivation that compels her higher-stakes choices, and her final choice to deceive Commander Voss is a credible micro-decision under pressure. However, her ally Luce feels more like a functional secondary character than a fully realized crucible for her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds tightly from the inciting blackout to the decisive change of the freed barges. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with a visible, felt cost (the fort's unlocked state) and is earned entirely through the protagonists' on-page actions and choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action ("cool iron," "bruised violet" sky). The setting actively pressures choices via the blackout and constrains tactics. It falls just short of a 9.0 as the environment, while evocative, doesn't quite *constrain* a pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from tracing the sundial to bridging the terminals. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the final image of the drifting barges and the fort's unlocked gates, a direct consequence of their risky actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "cradle of sparks" and the final, resonant image of writing "with light." The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question of oppressive control versus silent revolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, poetic texture with a controlled, consistent POV. Some phrases ("winking hush of conspirators") verge on overwriting but remain legible and voice-motivated. The distinct perceptual signature is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "two tongues of the same silent flame") and a template cadence in "Footsteps approached... Footsteps again."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story presents a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of steampunk-esque rebellion and poetic lyricism. The core concept of a "cradle of sparks" is original and deeply integrated, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
