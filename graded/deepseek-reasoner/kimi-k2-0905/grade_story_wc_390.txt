<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mireya's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her "logically emotional" calculus driving the climax. Her final choice to teach the shadows to listen is a credible, earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on professional competence in peak stress, but interior contradiction acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under a Hybrid lens, with the final image of the star-spiral reconfiguring meaning. Causality is airtight, with the key's use and the vibrational solution arising from established world rules. The cost is legible in the worn key and her tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Mireya's professional perception. The ice and key are recurring objects that constrain choice and are indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, tightening through the "logically emotional calculus" that forces a third-path choice. The cost is unmistakable: the key grows hot and is worn smooth, a visible price paid. The stakes (town vs. nightmares) are braided and converge perfectly at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening as absolution emerges organically from events and the final image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the star-spiral map. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the shadows softening into forgiven silhouettes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the ice remembered when it was glacier"). The voice is consistently "fleshly ethereal," modulating with pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor –0.3 deduction for a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in a few high-pressure beats, though it remains coherent and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic engineering, ecological memory, and nightmare logic is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical conclusion, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
