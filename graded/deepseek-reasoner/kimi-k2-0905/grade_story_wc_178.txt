<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Naram-bel's frugality, devotion, and fear are embodied and drive his high-stakes choice to activate the tile. His final vow of silence is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost, rooted in his established longing and the loss of his sister. A minor deduction for interiority that, while concrete, could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Hybrid, leaning Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Naram-bel becomes "the silence between regimes." The cost is legible on the page in his disappearance and the final image of "dust that refused to settle." Causality is tight, with the tile's activation leading directly to the covenant's terms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The palace setting is a crucible that pressures choice and charges the final image. The "cold copper" door and the "hollow cube of air" are micro-settings that directly constrain and enable the protagonist's actions. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through the astronomer's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the hybrid lens. The dominant stake (preserving knowledge) tightens meaningfully as the schematic drawing leads to the door's opening and the covenant's revelation. The cost is unmistakable: the forfeiture of his former life to become the palace's eternal watcher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image, exploring the tension between empirical knowledge and sacred devotion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that guarding the unknown is the highest form of love. The final image of "encrypted devotion sealing their own uncertain futures" is profound without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the POV of a Babylonian astronomer. The perceptual signature is consistent and rich. A minor deduction for occasional ornate density that, while beautiful, very slightly impedes momentum in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "dust floated like pale constellations").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite and densely poetic, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of a paraphrase loop ("empirical irony" is used twice in close succession near the end), which slightly dulls the razor-sharp precision of the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient astronomy, mathematical mysticism, and historical transition feels fresh, inevitable, and wholly original. The core concept of "encrypted devotion" is a specific, non-obvious angle that is fully committed to, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
