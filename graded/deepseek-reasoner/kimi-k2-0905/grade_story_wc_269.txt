<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her tapping ritual ("three short, two long") establishing a consistent, obsessive trait that drives the plot. Her final realization—that her role is "never to prove loss but to remember the way back"—is an earned internal shift rooted in the climactic discovery. The only minor limitation is a slight abstraction in the final epiphany, but it remains grounded in the concrete imagery of the hologram.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is masterfully held, building through the pattern of the tapping, the found atlas page, and the returning pings to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The cost is legible in the final image of the station as a "gate left ajar," reconfiguring Mira's purpose from passive witness to active keeper of time. The delayed revelation is paid off on the page with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The monitoring station's stilts and the submersible enable the descent, while the lifeless limestone ridge and holographic reef are essential to the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the metal answering back with a "hollow sheen" and the pillars exhaling "a cloud of silt."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to summons under the accumulative lens, driven by Mira's agency in investigating the sound and descending. The cost is the irreversible reconfiguration of her purpose, foreclosing her passive role. The pressure coheres through the assembly of clues—missing map, returning sound—culminating in the decisive choice to insert the atlas page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of loss and memory, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: paths are "not erased but hidden, waiting for the witness." The hologram's "bright alphabets" and the redefined "Witness Return" path reweight prior material without statement, achieving profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional, grief-tinted perception. The voice is distinct and lyrical ("a white mantis above the lagoon") yet remains taut under pressure. The patterned elision of who left the atlas page is purposeful, focusing the narrative on Mira's discovery rather than external causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences are propulsive and multi-tasking ("Each dusk she climbed the ladder... so the sensors would remember her pulse"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every image serves character and conflict. Rhythm is controlled and varied, enhancing the atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological elegy, archeological mystery, and a personal witness arc is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "delayed revelation" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and character. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly at closure.</comment>
