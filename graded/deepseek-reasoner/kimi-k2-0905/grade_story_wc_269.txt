<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with her "periodically eternal" tapping ritual establishing a concrete, obsessive interiority. Her final choice to remember rather than prove loss is earned by the tactile discovery process and her history of grief. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic label in "delayed revelation stir like a eel," though it is quickly embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, with pressure escalating through layered clues (atlas, sound, memory) to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The final image of the station as a "gate left ajar" reconfigures Mira's role with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is tight, with each discovery narrowing her options toward the inevitable descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The station's "drifting moored" state and the submersible's "dormant batteries" are micro-settings that directly enable and pressure Mira's actions. The holographic reef projection is the ultimate environmental constraint that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens through a series of deepening discoveries that change Mira's knowledge. The cost of her choice—foreclosing a path of proof for one of guardianship—is legible in the final reconfiguration of the station from "sentry" to "gate." Agency is fully demonstrated in her decision to descend and insert the atlas page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central paradox of paths that are "not erased but hidden," resisting any direct statement. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the question of loss and memory through the hologram's lesson and Mira's resumed tapping. The integration is flawless, with every image serving the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional, grief-tinted perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature ("ocean still clenched its dead reefs like broken teeth"). The lyrical compression is purposeful and taught, with elision (e.g., the exact nature of the pillars' technology) serving the mystery and paying off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled ("white mantis above the lagoon," "moonlight painted the station a drifting moored specter"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every sentence advances the narrative with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate fiction, mystery, and archeology feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "delayed revelation" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and character, avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
