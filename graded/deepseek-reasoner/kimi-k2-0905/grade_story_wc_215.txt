<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alden's motivation is deeply rooted and intensifies under pressure, compelling his final vow. His "tranquilly perceptive" nature is embodied through specific, concrete observations that reveal character. The final choice to stay and mend the fracture is earned by prior causality, with visible cost felt in the weight on his chest. Minor deduction for the "ghosts leaned forward" beat, which slightly abstracts a collective emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost—the scent of clover signals a reweighting of the covenant's meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density of imagery. A slight deduction for a soft causality link; the child's arrival feels more atmospheric than a direct "because" of prior events, though it serves the textural escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. The oasis and stained glass box are tactile, lived-in elements that actively pressure Alden's actions. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through his POV, with the "sun-cracked frames" and "scent of blooming clover" doing multiple jobs. No flaws.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, with the child's arrival and the box's fracture serving as a decisive intensification that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the "pressure equal to the desert’s heat pressing against his ribs." The final choice to stay and mend the fracture narrows options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between silence and speech, preservation and release. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared words and blooming clover, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The "tangled covenant" and "unspoken words" are fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in lines like "ash in spirals that resembled the old hives' missing bees." The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping. The voice modulates with pressure while maintaining its poetic consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddying sense. Sentences like "a hush heavier than honey poured onto the parchment" perform multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic ghost story with beekeeping mythology is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of preserving unspoken words is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
