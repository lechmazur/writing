<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is precise and embodied, from her professional expertise ("trained ear identified the walk") to her micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization of the labyrinth's true purpose is earned by her prior mapping and the stranger's arrival. The woman's academic gait and emotional motivation are equally distinct and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: the geomagnetic storm disables tech, forcing reliance on Mira's maps, which intersect with the stranger's inherited knowledge. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth is redefined as an acoustic machine, a decisive change with a felt cost of prior incomplete understanding. The cost is legible in Mira's realization that her maps were "incomplete."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. The geomagnetic storm isn't just backdrop; it enables the discovery by disabling GPS and amplifying sound. The labyrinth itself, a "towering labyrinth of shipping containers," is a tactile, pressure-filled environment that dictates movement and ultimately reveals its true, acoustic function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Mira's decision to engage and lead deepens the mystery. The stakes transform from professional curiosity to a profound historical and conceptual discovery. The cost is the reweighting of Mira's entire understanding of her life's work, made legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "whispers travel farther than shouts" is fully integrated, emerging organically from the plot and culminating in the powerful final image of the whisper network. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the concrete discovery of the chamber and its purpose. The concept is proved, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional, embodied perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture, and the dialogue is economical and carries significant subtext and goal-pursuit. The whispered exchanges are particularly effective, reinforcing the theme while advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "calculated spontaneity of the moment," which feels slightly external to Mira's POV. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a geomagnetic storm, a container labyrinth, and a historical whisper network is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual climax pays off magnificently.</comment>
