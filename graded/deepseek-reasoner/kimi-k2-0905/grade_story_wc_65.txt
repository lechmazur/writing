<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies through surrender; interiority is concrete with embodied cost (frostbite, memory loss). Final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost scaling to length. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (becoming the constraint) with undeniable cost (loss of self). Orientation is clear within 120 words; pattern is taught early and pays off at closure with the question-mark crack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spire and lake function as micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., unmarred surface necessitates innovation) and charges the final image (hairline crack). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens (writing costs memories, quill drinks warmth/weight). Dominant stake (writing future without imposition) tightens through meaningful deepening; cost is legible in frostbite and memory loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme (ignorance as creative vacuum) emerges organically through events and images; ending offers non-literal resonance ("space where futures grow"). No moralizing; subtext operates in implication (quill as exchange, feather as legacy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with poetic perceptual signature; lyric compression is taught and pays off. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful with high information density; figurative language supports theme without muddle. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("fragments of prophecy") but no loops or artifacts harming closure. Rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography and creation myths; risk-taking poetic style heightens stakes. Premise is fully committed and transformed through specific detail (kingfisher feather, obsidian spire). Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
