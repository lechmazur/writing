<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in professional obsession and a need for truth. Her micro-choices under pressure—stamping her wrist, extinguishing the lantern—are specific and reveal her values. The final choice to rewrite the index is a decisive change earned by her tactile discovery, with the cost of subverting her official mandate legible in her "dappled resolve."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: pressure builds through sensory details and pattern recognition. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the city's true history is reweighted from erasure to remembrance. The cost is felt in Mara's private defiance and the echoing truth of the cards. The final image ("each step echoing like a newly catalogued truth") makes the cost and change undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The flooded library, the blackout, and the cold seawater are not just atmospheric but actively constrain Mara's choices and enable her discovery (e.g., using the phosphorescent plankton). The environment charges the final image, with the cards whispering of "dry earth." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (trace honest origins) and escalate under the accumulative lens through a series of deepening discoveries. The dominant stake is tested and transformed by Mara's agency: her hypothesis about the stamp's negative space and her decision to work in absolute darkness directly lead to the climactic revelation. The cost is the subversion of her official task, a tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the concrete action and central image of the bruised cards. The concept of knowledge as suppression and the power of absence is explored without a hint of moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech." The piece achieves profound thematic resonance through its particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, filtered through Mara's professional and perceptual lens. The prose has a distinct, textured quality that reflects her state of mind, with rhythmic control evident in lines like "water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause." Purposeful elision (the Council's nature) is taught and pays off, reinforcing the theme of suppressed knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstraction in a few phrases (e.g., "neural static," "hush of civilizations"). However, these are brief and do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure. The final paragraph is a masterclass in resonant, image-driven writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken city, a logical indexer, and an antique stamp is original and feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world-building and character. The central conceit—reading history through the bruises of suppression—is a fresh, non-obvious angle that is executed with high conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking.</comment>
