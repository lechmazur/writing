<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation sharpens credibly from professional duty to personal revelation, embodied in micro-choices like extinguishing the lantern. Her final resolve to "remember" is earned by prior tactile struggle with the cards. The "tranquilly perceptive" wrist mark subtly constrains her attention without diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly: pattern recognition through physical indentations escalates to conceptual repricing of the catalogue's purpose. Closure lands with cost as Mara internalizes the "reclaimed stillness" against "false history." The blackout enables but doesn't resolve the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The library functions as both setting and constraint—flooded shelves force wading, dripping chandeliers mark time, and phosphorescent plankton reveals the glyph. The stamp's interaction with water transforms it from tool to map. Every sensory detail serves pressure or revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from taxonomic adjustment to uncovering systemic erasure, driven by Mara's agency in reordering cards and testing darkness. Cost is legible in her dappled resolve and the "private pressure" she carries. The blackout tightens options but doesn't resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the stamp's negative space and bruised cards—erasure as control, memory as resistance. The ending reweights the catalogue without moralizing, offering a "non-literal answer" through topographic headings. Subtext operates in images like "slow applause" dripping from chandeliers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and perceptually distinct, with a professional lexicon ("logical page indexer") yielding to lyrical compression under pressure ("neural static"). The stamp's description is voice-motivated; elision (e.g., Council details) serves closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythmic control ("water streaming from her coat, each step echoing"). Minor scaffold in "reclaimed stillness" repetition, but it pays off at closure. No mixed metaphors or loops; figurative language serves revelation (glyph as street grid).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken city, archival mystery, and epistemological rebellion. The stamp's dual function (ink imprint, plankton map) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
