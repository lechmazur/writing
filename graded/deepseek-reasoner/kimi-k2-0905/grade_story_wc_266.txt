<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear, embodied micro-choices (e.g., Marta's weathered fingers tracing her punch, Jun's young eyes seeing shifts). However, interior contradiction under peak stress is more told than shown; the hound's realization ("having discovered that the courage...") is summarized rather than dramatized through embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the hound, Charged Poise for the guides) with clear cost: the hound's whimper and transformed howl signal a felt shift from duty to choice. The pattern of indirect routes and recurring images pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally integrated and constrains choice. The veiled ridgeway's shifting contours and the ticket punches' chiming directly shape the journey's tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional urgency (e.g., "lanterns casting amber pools on the mist-shrouded path").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through the guides' navigation of fractured reality. The cost is legible in the hound's matted fur and whimper. A minor deduction as the final choice (stamping the hound) feels slightly swift, though earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action ("courage unused still exists within"). The final image of the hound's transformed howl offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A slight tell occurs in Marta's dialogue ("she must learn that courage unused still exists within"), stating rather than purely implying the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, mythological texture that remains consistent under pressure. POV is stable (third-person limited). The prose's rhythmic quality ("their lanterns creating a constellation of light against the deepening dark") supports the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught (e.g., "paw prints that appeared and vanished like breath on cold glass"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally to match the contemplative yet urgent pace. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mythological ferry guides and a psychological concept of courage feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world logic and character. The risk of a quiet, internal climax is taken and succeeds due to the accumulative build-up.</comment>
