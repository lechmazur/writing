<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is rich and specific, with Marta's "shoreline lullaby" voice and Jun's "gently persistent nature" serving as distinct, embodied traits that drive micro-choices under pressure. The hound's internal crisis is a powerful externalization of the story's thematic conflict, and the final choice to mark her as a partner is earned by the preceding causality. A minor deduction for a slight convergence of voice under peak stress, but interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands with undeniable cost: the hound's understanding that courage is internal, not external, reconfigures the entire premise of the crossing and its guardianship. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through dense, lyrical patterns that culminate in the star-stamp's transformative touch. The final image of the hound's howl transformed into a "welcoming" call is the exact point where cost is legible, fulfilling the proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "ticket punch with star stamp" is a masterful micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image, qualifying for the 9-band. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through professional priority (e.g., lanterns casting "amber pools," paths that exist in "multiple directions simultaneously"). The veiled ridgeway itself is a character, shifting and foreign, actively pressuring the guides' choices and tactics throughout the journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the guides' decision to follow the "ethereal paw prints" through "indirect routes" deepens their knowledge and narrows their options. The cost is legible in the landscape's fracturing and the hound's "matted" fur and "whimper," paid for by their departure from the "safety of the known shore." The dominant stake (restoring balance to the crossing) is tested and earned through their specific, difficult choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of internal courage emerges organically from the core concept and is answered with a resonant, non-literal final image: the hound's howl transformed into a "shoreline lullaby." The star-stamp's reprise on the hound's forehead is a perfect, charged particular that reweights all prior material without moralizing. The piece achieves profound emotional and thematic honesty, avoiding sentimentality through concrete struggle and earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, mythic quality that remains consistent and legible under pressure ("paw prints that appeared and vanished like breath on cold glass"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the guides' professional worldview. The patterned elision of the landscape's logic is taught early and pays off at closure, fulfilling the experimental allowance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without becoming sluggish, achieving high information density and propulsion. There is a single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("mournful howl" / "desperate searching") but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Sentence-level craft is exemplary, with syntax and rhythm accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs, particularly in the climactic beat with the hound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the ferry guide premise with the internal quest for courage is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The unconventional, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, supporting the story's singular artistic stance.</comment>
