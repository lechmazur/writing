<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation ("feared silence more") is clear and intensifies, compelling the high-stakes choice to swallow the diamond. Her embodied emotion ("copper veins like loose wires") and micro-choices (sorting crow feathers) reveal a concrete interiority under pressure. The final choice is a credible, earned renunciation with immense visible cost ("body calcified"), foreclosing her path to preserve the language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image of her statue conducting the symphony reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (her death for the language's life). The lens holds from start to finish, building through accumulating sensory and sonic density. The cost is legible on the page in the visceral description of her calcification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The canyon and bone towers are not just described but are the engine of the plot, their echoes enabling the translation. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's specific, professional focus on texture and sound. The environment evolves causally with the climax, the tunnel "drinking" the light and "giving back choirs."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from listening to active experimentation with the diamond and feathers. The dominant stake (preventing linguistic silence) tightens meaningfully with each step deeper into the ritual. The cost is unmistakable and visceral, culminating in the ultimate price of her life, which is paid on the page with devastating clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice for cultural preservation emerges organically from the specific, grounded particulars of texture and sound, never stated directly. The final image offers a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting all prior material: her statue becomes the language's new heart. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and haunting, achieved entirely through scene and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature obsessed with texture and acoustics. The voice is consistently poetic yet purposeful, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure. There is a single, very slight register drift in "quietly articulate," which feels slightly authorial, but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates the ritual's cadence. There is near-zero scaffold or loop; every sentence advances atmosphere and character. A minor figurative density appears in the peak beat ("phonograph of textures"), but it is pattern-taught and pays off, causing only a minimal coherence strain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is breathtakingly original, synthesizing concepts of linguistic death, sensory translation, and cursed artifacts into a singular, inevitable whole. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on preservation mythology. Bold risk-taking in the highly poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry, fully committing to its vision.</comment>
