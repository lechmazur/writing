<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied; her fear of silence versus the curse creates compelling contradiction. Final choice to swallow the diamond is a high-stakes micro-choice rooted in established motivation, with visible cost in her calcification. Embodied emotion ("copper veins rattled like loose wires") avoids diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost (calcification). The final image of the statue and heron confirms grammar held, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; pattern of texture-to-sound translation pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: bone towers and tunnel constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("textured, like running one’s tongue over unglazed pottery"). Environment actively shapes tactics (echoes multiply syllables, wind plays flutes).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: swallowing the diamond is a decisive act that forces the trade-off (life for voices). Cost is legible in the slowing heart and calcification. Pressure tightens meaningfully through sound/texture accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the texture-sound translation premise; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to language death through continuance. Final image of the statue and heron reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("grammar of textures"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within the character's lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Few artifacts; figurative language is coherent and pattern-driven ("pulse into meter, skin into drum"). Minor deduction for one potential paraphrase loop ("texture into sound" / "memory into continuance"), but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of language death, sensory translation, and curse tropes feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
