<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("decode feedback into direction") is dramatized through her repair choices and the final drone teaching. Her blindness is a genuine constraint that shapes every tactile action. The final choice to use the rain barrel is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values: understanding over mere fixing. Contradictory impulses (urgency vs. magnetic calm) act simultaneously in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change: the drone is repaired and launched, meeting the ship. The causal lens holds firmly: the broken wing leads to the discovery of the swelling battery, which necessitates the silica patch, which then reveals the feedback loop error, which is finally solved by the rain barrel. Cost is legible in the line about the village waiting "another season for antidotes" and the seven-minute deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, glass drippers, and rain barrel are not just atmospheric but actively constrain and enable Lira's choices. The depot's distant boiler provides a metronome for her work. The setting's sensory details (hiss of steam, taste of light) are filtered through Lira's unique perception, making the environment a direct extension of her character and the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is masterful and driven by agency. The initial fracture deepens to a battery swell, which is patched, only to reveal a deeper software terror learned from the crash. Each complication narrows Lira's options, forcing her to a more ingenious solution. The cost of failure (village without antidotes) is a persistent, felt pressure that charges every action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action: healing requires understanding the source of brokenness, not just mending the shell. This is answered non-literally in the final image of the drone now carrying a "translucent map" to read chaos. The concept of translating terror into torque is a resonant, earned insight that reweights the entire repair process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Lira's blindness. The prose's distinct texture—lyrical yet precise—mirrors her perception of the world through refracted light. The single line of dialogue from Col is goal-driven and advances the plot. The voice remains consistent under peak pressure, employing purposeful compression ("decode feedback into direction").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the deadline. A minor deduction for a slight phrasing loop: "decode feedback into direction" is stated twice, though it functions as a thematic anchor. Figurative language ("a second heart that had forgotten its rhythm") is sharp and coherent, never muddying clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using hydro-optics to repair a biomechanical drone is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and method. The final solution—using agitated water to calm the drone's panic—is a brilliant, non-obvious inflection that grows directly from the established particulars of the world and Lira's character.</comment>
