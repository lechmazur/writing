<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and deeply embodied, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (e.g., seeking closure by reopening a wound). The final choice to offer blood is earned by prior causality, and the cost is visible on the page as the scar splits and the plants drink the offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the seed and the period-shaped scar reweights the premise of reading stories in scars. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through density of imagery. Cost is legible in the blood offering and the scar's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tower, hourglass, and coffee rings function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's specific grief (e.g., "tasting iron and lilac," "meteor hush"). The environment is integral to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to the decisive action of reopening the wound. The cost is unmistakable and visceral: "the scar split willingly" and "blood dripped onto the trapped light." The trade with the miracle forces a fresh loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into a bearable story emerges organically from concrete particulars (scars, hourglass, seed). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "scars are simply stories written sideways." The final image of the seed and the period-shaped scar provides profound thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("anesthesia wore off, tasting iron and lilac"). The voice is highly controlled and poetic, with purposeful compression and elision that serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor clusters in high-pressure beats (e.g., "each brown rim a vertebra in the spine of memory"), but clarity is never fully obscured and the closure image remains potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, botanical telepathy, and a displaced miracle is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally resonant conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
