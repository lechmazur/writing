<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear, rooted in a breached contract and maternal legacy. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("cheeks freckled with pollen"). A meaningful change is earned: her feisty endurance forecloses easy reconciliation with the elders, a cost felt when she bars the door. Her final wisdom to her daughter feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mender's refusal to accept the amended contracts crystallizes a new, self-determined relationship with the city. The accumulative lens holds, building meaning through recurring images. Cost is legible in the final image of her contentment beneath the grafted beam, having traded social reconciliation for the orchard's independence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The cathedral orchard is not a postcard but a crucible: its rafters are navigated, its figs contain scrolls, its roots coil around corbels. The environment shapes every tactic, from grafting with the copper gear to lashing the wound with the ribbon. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the mender's professional gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens. The breach of contract creates immediate pressure. The mender's choice to open the forgotten bag is a decisive turn that narrows options and changes knowledge (reading the scrolls). The cost is unmistakable: her persistence requires using her daughter's ribbon as a tool, foreclosing the path of easy payment and forcing a stance of defiant endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "deciduous vows," resisting tidy moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Promises are leaves; they must fall so the tree notices its own rings." This wisdom arises from concrete particulars—the graft, the rotting ribbon—and reweights the entire narrative, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a mender's expertise ("quartz monocle," "cambium thrumming"). The prose is purposefully dense but never obscures causality. POV is stable and deeply embodied. The lyrical, accumulative pattern is taught early and pays off magnificently at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("time persisting like sap in winter"). There is a single minor artifact: the phrase "accidental wisdom" is repeated, but this functions as a taught pattern that pays off thematically, so the deduction is minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cathedral orchard, quartz-eye mender, and deciduous vows is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in the dense, lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
