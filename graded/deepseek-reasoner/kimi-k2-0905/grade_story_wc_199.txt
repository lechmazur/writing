<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is clear and steady, rooted in a desire for balance rather than glory. Her micro-choices under pressure (sorting seeds to calm herself, building monuments) reveal a consistent, embodied character. The final choice to speak the name feels earned, though a touch more internal contradiction during the climb could have elevated the score further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with each leaf and monument building pressure toward the climactic revelation. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing ("Reciprocity") that lands on the page with clear, felt cost (the tree's descent, the rain's return). The orientation is masterful, establishing the strange reality within the first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is not merely described; it actively pressures Mireya's choices, creaking and drifting higher to create urgency. The moonstone dust and the leaves themselves are micro-settings that constrain and enable her method. Sensory detail is lush, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-oriented perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the arbor's ascent and the accumulating syllables, tightening the temporal stake brilliantly. Mireya's agency is constant—her sorting, prodding, and monument-building actively narrow her options and lead to the final, decisive act. The cost of failure (the chance vanishing above the cloudline) is a live, palpable pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific action of decoding and remembering, culminating in the powerful, non-literal answer of "Reciprocity." The concept of forgotten covenants is deeply integrated into the world's logic and Mireya's motivation. The final image of the monuments becoming seeds of memory is a masterful, resonant payoff that avoids any moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a lyrical, mossy-delight quality that filters the world through Mireya's perceptive, methodical consciousness. The prose is purposefully compressed and dense, taught early, and pays off at closure. A minor deduction for occasional syntactic complexity that slightly obscures immediacy in high-pressure beats, but never breaks comprehension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward stacked modifiers and complex metaphor ("the hush where past meets prophecy thickened like fog between seasons") creates minor artifacts that, while beautiful, occasionally slow momentum and require re-reading, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of folklore, botany, and memory is breathtakingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a tree whose leaves contain a forgotten story is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The story commits fully to its singular, high-concept premise without a hint of derivative execution.</comment>
