<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireille's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to engage rather than observe. Her final choice to embed the orris root is a micro-choice that reveals her values and offers a credible, earned renunciation. Her internal contradiction—noticing the abnormal yet seeking to understand rather than banish it—acts simultaneously throughout. The cost of her temporary authority and the house's disappointment is felt in her wrists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held, with pressure escalating through pattern density and a decisive cadence shift at the paper-boat ritual. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the house's loneliness is reconfigured into a borrowed heartbeat, with cost legible in the "vacuum seal of quiet." The pattern of displacement is taught early and pays off impeccably at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The cottage, its objects, and the "shard of hush" function as a micro-setting that directly constrains Mireille's choices and charges the final image. Sensory selection is exquisite and reflects her particular perception, from "ironed linen and vanished birthdays" to the scent of "attic dust that smelled of her grandmother’s cedar chest."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mireille's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to participatory ritual. The dominant stake (understanding sentient architecture) tightens meaningfully as she offers her own displacement for the house to mimic. The cost is unmistakable in the house's "disappointment thud inside her wrists" and the subsequent "vacuum seal of quiet" that mutes the morning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of loneliness and the borrowing of life emerges organically from the particulars of the house's choreography and Mireille's ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the cottage "folding hands after prayer," reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the furniture settling with disappointment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature perfectly aligned to Mireille's role. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, achieving a hushed, lyrical quality that never obscures clarity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the house's exact nature) is taught and pays off at closure. POV is stable and deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is pristine, with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and breathtakingly original ("wings cutting hushed blaze trails"). Rhythm is varied and propulsive, perfectly matching the story's accumulative, hushed tone. A masterclass in line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of a sentient, lonely house collecting human residue is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The execution is bold and fully committed, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The combination of a "creeping normality noticer" and this premise is organic and singular, resisting all templates.</comment>
