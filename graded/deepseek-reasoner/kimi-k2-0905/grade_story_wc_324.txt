<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in a desire to protect vulnerable voices. Her internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices, such as pressing the hearing aid deeper and choosing to lie to Hask. The final choice to upload the proof is earned by prior causality, with the cost visible in the confrontation's tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Hask's collapse) with a resonant reconfiguration (the dead's voices becoming a palpable force). The causal lens holds tightly: Mira's investigation leads directly to the confrontation and its resolution. The cost is legible on the page in Hask's crumpling and the sirens' approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a masterclass in atmosphere, functioning as both setting and a character that swallows sound and light. It consistently pressures choices, from the moss-draped clipboard to the koi pond wall. The environment constrains the final confrontation, charging the image with palpable tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from following the pulse to breaching the archive. The stakes—protecting Lila's legacy from corporate erasure—are clear and heighten meaningfully. The cost is unmistakable in the standoff with Hask and the threat of the ledger drowning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of "incidental heroism" and the protection of vulnerable voices against institutional erasure. The final image of a "world slightly more honest" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the mist-clad atrium swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light"). The voice is consistent and lyrical under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the upload process) is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening paragraph creates a minor momentum drag. However, rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled, accelerating with the confrontation and breathing at the resolution. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a supernatural premise with a deeply human, ethical conflict is fresh and feels inevitable. The core concept of "heart-tracing" is wholly original and executed with bold specificity, committing fully to its implications without retreat into cliché or safety.</comment>
