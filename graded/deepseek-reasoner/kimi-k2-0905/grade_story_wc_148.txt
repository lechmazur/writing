<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation ("to thread a labyrinth with your own story") is specific, rooted in a credible inheritance of his father's legacy, and compels his high-stakes choice to confront the past. His interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in his interaction with the lattice ("warmed against his ribs") and his reading of the mattress manuscript. The final choice to descend the staircase of lies is a credible endurance that forecloses a path, though the felt cost of this inheritance is slightly more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through dense imagery and pattern until the final Conceptual Repricing reconfigures the meaning of the father's lies. Closure lands with undeniable cost in the final image of the lighthouse grinding lies into beams and the son carrying the inherited hush. The orientation is deliberately disoriented but taught early and pays off at closure, waiving the penalty. The final beam of light acts as a decisive change that makes the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is not merely a backdrop but a crucible that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Its impossible gravity ("the floor forget gravity") forces a specific action (hovering), and the revolving lens without light is the key object that transforms the lies. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully filtered through Cassian's POV, with the salt-bitten hinges and smell of lantern oil and gull blood creating a palpable, lived-in atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres and escalates through a single, meaningful cadence shift: the transformation of the father's lies into a tangible staircase. This reweights the dominant stake of inheriting truth from falsehood with a clear conceptual cost. Agency is demonstrated through Cassian's deliberate act of fitting the lattice to the lens, a choice that narrows his options and forces his descent. The timeframe ("before they find the bodies") provides a live clock that tightens the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the lattice, the lighthouse, and the act of chasing silence, resisting any direct statement or moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of inherited truth, reweighting the parable through the final realization: "the wolf is me, and I am not early, I am exact." Subtext operates powerfully in the father's rusted-shut voice and the building's final sigh, which forgives nothing but records everything.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure ("the hush darted ahead, a silver minnow of silence"). POV is stable and deeply embedded in Cassian's consciousness. Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("copperlight repose") are taught early and paid off at closure. The single line of dialogue is goal-driven and carries significant subtext, advancing the core conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and highly lyrical, with exceptional information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor risk of overwriting appears in the slightly overused phrase "copperlight repose," creating a subtle template cadence that slightly dulls the final reprise. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a high degree of originality by synthesizing the well-known parable with a fresh, gothic-inflected concept of a labyrinthine lighthouse that sustains impossibilities. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle, transforming the fable through specific, grounded choices in character (the son inheriting the echo) and world (the prison that records lies). The final reconfiguration of the wolf as "withheld truth" feels both inevitable and ingenious in hindsight.</comment>
