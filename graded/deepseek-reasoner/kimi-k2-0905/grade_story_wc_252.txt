<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion ("heart tugged harder than gravity"). Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final choice to teach others to dive is rooted in prior causality and her established role as a harmonizer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost, landing on the page as the island detaches and the new raft-city forms. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through image and pattern. A slight causality question around the whale call's precise mechanism prevents a higher score, but the closure effect is undeniable and cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe setting is masterfully integrated, actively pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("barnacled ladder," "breathing rocks"). The environment constrains tactics and evolves causally with events, functioning as a crucible for the protagonist's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift as her song integrates with the whale's call. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the island's roots snap and the old ground dissolves. The dominant stake (choosing the island's next shape) is tested and reweighted through her combative tenderness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring the transformation of violence into community through a non-literal, resonant answer. The final image of the "unmarked map" offers a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly in the scrimshaw's evolving symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation that heightens pressure. The prose's lyrical quality is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's consciousness, with no head-hopping. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor rhythm plateau occurs mid-story with a short series of similar sentence structures. This does not obscure closure clarity. The read-aloud test passes with flying colors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story exhibits rare originality, synthesizing a fantastical premise with profound emotional truth through specific, grounded choices. The core concept of a disappearing island is transformed into a unique meditation on community and freedom. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
