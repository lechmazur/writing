<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief and motivation are intensely embodied and drive the high-stakes choice of suicide. The final choice is earned by the accumulating cost of the hunt, with the geode's taste of wedding cake a specific, character-particular detail. However, the initial leap from grief-stricken survivor to perturbation theorist feels like a slight knowledge leap, a minor motivation break that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure is a powerful, on-page Charged Poise: the suicide is a decisive change that reconfigures the protagonist's role from victim to a perturbation, with the cost felt in the final image of the desert rushing up. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through the collection of lost potentials until the final, inevitable reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory and geode are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The observatory's listing alters the wind; the geode's crumbling dictates the pace of the hunt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through crisis (e.g., "stardust that tasted like my wedding cake").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, with each harvested potential increasing the stakes and the moral cost of the hunt. The dominant stake (harvesting potential vs. surrendering to grief) tightens meaningfully, culminating in the final, costly decision. The cost is legible on the page in the geode's fragmentation and the protagonist's realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of grief commodifying possibility is fully integrated and emerges with devastating power from the core concept and specific events. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the entire narrative: the hunt was not to find potential, but to realize it was always there, a bleak and exhilarating Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable and possesses a distinct, compelling perceptual signature, with a lyrical, despairing rhythm that holds under extreme pressure. The voice is consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of perturbation theory) serves the story's accumulative, textural drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control and potent imagery. A minor deduction for slight over-writing in a few phrases (e.g., "mechanical grief," "death's accountant") which edge toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, creating a small register drift from the otherwise embodied narration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept sci-fi (perturbation theory) with raw, intimate grief is original, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, devastating conclusion, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
