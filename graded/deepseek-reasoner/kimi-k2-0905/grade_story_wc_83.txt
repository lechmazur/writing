<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in lines like "fragments crumbled into stardust that tasted like my wedding cake." The final choice to dive is a credible renunciation, though the leap from grief to "death's accountant" could use a touch more micro-choice grounding in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Closure is a decisive change (the dive) with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost, landing as a resonant reconfiguration. The geode's destruction and the final perturbation are earned by prior causality. Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, serving the disorienting premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystal are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through crisis ("helium sacs hissing," "stardust that tasted like my wedding cake"). The setting is indispensable to the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, each action narrowing options and accruing cost ("Each action cost pieces of the geode"). The dominant stake (harvesting potential vs. surrendering to grief) tightens meaningfully, with the cost legible in the geode's destruction and the final leap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of harvesting unlived lives, resisting moralizing for complex ambiguity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief's utility. The bleak exhilaration is earned through concrete particulars, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently elevated yet apt for the character's expertise and grief. All elision is purposeful and taught, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though minor figurative strain appears in peak beats (e.g., "grave robber of possibility" leans slightly diagnostic). Momentum is sustained, and the closure image is clear. A single –0.4 deduction for a minor artifact in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept sci-fi (perturbation theory) with intimate grief is original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded detail. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
