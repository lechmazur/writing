<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptional, with her contradictory impulses (combative tenderness, refusal to forget) acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to mentor the child is earned by prior causality, specifically her memory of her own mentor and the cost of her refusal, which is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Lira's act of rewriting the exile into a loop reconfigures the library's options with a clear, conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the pattern of shards, leaves, and the swing's ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable. The library, the shard-mirror coat, and the teacup are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lira's specific, archival perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. The prophecy of becoming a text forces a high-stakes choice, and Lira's decision to walk deeper and later rewrite the exile's rules narrows her options with a visible cost—the potential loss of her own self to save the library.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the integration of concept and character. The final image of the unbroken circle and the annotation "Resilience is walking backwards..." offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose's density is high but purposeful, taught by the opening lines and paid off at closure. POV is stable and deeply embedded in Lira's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing that requires a second read (e.g., "afternoon shadow caught in glass above the lintel"), but these are few and do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the reversible exile concept with the specific, lived detail of the archivist and the library is original, ingenious, and feels inevitable. The risk-taking in the poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
