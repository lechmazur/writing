<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "wistfully pragmatic" nature driving every action. Her motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is dramatized through concrete choices like stealing the gauge tooth and promising the boy a leaf. The final choice to teach him gardening is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her stolen time and the dissolved petal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the boy carries an internal "reflected moon" into future darkness, a decisive change earned by the causal chain of her breaking in and guiding him. The inferred lens is Causal, held perfectly from her motivated break-in to the boy's transformed descent. Cost is legible in the dissolved petal and her dawn vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harbor and rooftop garden are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable choices—the locked door forces the lockpick's use, the moonlit harbor informs the central metaphor. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("diesel and starfish," "salt-stained concrete"), filtered through Mara's poetic yet pragmatic perception. The lockpick itself functions as a key object, charging the final image by enabling the climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: her need to open the door tightens into the specific promise to the boy, culminating in the rooftop revelation. The dominant stake (hope vs. despair) deepens through her actions, with cost paid in risk and time. The lockpick's use is a meaningful tightening that narrows options and enables the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action—the "quivering hush" between endings and beginnings, the oar as promise. The final image of the boy carrying a "reflected moon" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hope in darkness. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, like the unspoken exchange of the rose petal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct, with a poetic yet grounded perceptual signature ("moonlight combed his hair"). POV is stable and deeply embodied, with rhythm modulating under pressure ("pull, lift, glide"). The elision of the boy's dialogue is taught and purposeful, reinforcing the story's reliance on gesture and image over speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like a blade pressed flat against skin"). Minor artifact: slight density in the opening metaphor stack, but it establishes voice and doesn't obscure closure. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, echoing the oar motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lockpick, gardener, and harbor is fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in the quiet, image-driven climax that heightens stakes. The concept feels wholly original, transforming familiar tropes through specific, lived detail. The boy's transformation through nature rather than confrontation is a bold, non-obvious choice.</comment>
