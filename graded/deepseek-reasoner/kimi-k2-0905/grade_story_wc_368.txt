<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hoshiko's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like pressing the wing to the window revealing her watchful nature. The final renunciation—choosing to teach invisibility over collection—is earned by the donor heart's revelations. The only minor flaw is a slight register drift in peak emotional beats, such as "quietly explosive gift," which edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds perfectly, with each vision and memory deepening the thematic question until the resonant reconfiguration at closure. The final image of Hoshiko folding the painting and preparing to descend crystallizes the cost of her new purpose. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of revelation is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house and morpho wing are not just vivid descriptions; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The wing dissolves into a map, and the tea house's ascent and descent mirror Hoshiko's internal journey. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional perspective as a dye master.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Hoshiko's agency under the accumulative lens, as each projected vision deepens her understanding and narrows her options. The cost is legible in the final paragraph—her old life as a collector is foreclosed for her new role as a teacher. The stake (learning why stories magnetize) is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of narrative porosity emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the heart's memories and Hoshiko's craft. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated, and the ending reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Hoshiko's profession ("watchful dye master"). The prose rhythm is controlled, even under the pressure of visionary revelations. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "quietly explosive" appears three times, creating a slight template cadence. This repetition is voice-motivated but slightly over-relied upon, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a heart transplant recipient inheriting memories is transformed through the specific, grounded choices of a dye master in a fantastical setting. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on how stories work. The risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
