<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. Her final choice to bake bread is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her professional identity shift felt in "her cultured fingers learning the muscle memory of survival." The grandmother's line provides crucial relational pressure that cracks her composure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong throughout, building pressure through pattern density. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost when Aurelia realizes "culture wasn't something you preserved behind glass." The beekeeper's absence creates persistent constraint, though his promised return slightly weakens causal tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated, with the grotto city and bakery constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered, particularly the opera glasses studying bread texture. The waterfall's roar becoming a lullaby shows expert tonal control through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aurelia's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible when she abandons documentation for participation. The dominant stake (preserving culture vs living it) tightens meaningfully through the community's actions. Minor deduction for beekeeper's unresolved promise slightly reducing pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bread-making and weaving, offering a resonant non-literal answer to cultural preservation. The final image of "H for home" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like flour whitening hair "like premature frost."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature with cultured yet vulnerable texture. POV is stable and depth-controlled, with elision taught early (beekeeper's absence). Lyrical compression serves accumulative design without obscuring closure. Minor register drift in "rosewater dread" slightly strains voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("rosewater dread" metaphor slightly muddles sense). Template cadence appears briefly in listing photographic subjects, but doesn't harm closure clarity. Overall momentum remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of displacement and cultural preservation. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation of museum guide trope through specific lived detail feels inevitable in hindsight. Premise avoids derivative templates through emotional specificity.</comment>
