<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the vial cork. The final choice to transmit love via vibration is earned by the established core concept and her mother's backstory. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing "screaming tenderness," which edges toward label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, reinterpreting the mother's disappearance through the lens of vibration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory patterns to a resonant final image. The cost of her solitude and longing is legible on the page, charging the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, garden, and vial cork are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful, filtered through the keeper's professional and personal priorities. The setting is indispensable to the narrative's logic and emotional effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, her actions intensifying the sensory and emotional pattern. The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is tested and validated by the boat's course change. The cost is her enduring solitude, a price paid for her chosen method of communication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and specific imagery, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: love transmitted on subtle vibrations. The final image reweights the premise of loss without moralizing. The concept of "screaming tenderness" is fully integrated into the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through vibration and scent. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and legible, modulating with emotional intensity. The voice is singular and consistently maintained, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting, such as "screaming tenderness," which risks abstraction in a high-pressure beat. The closure image remains clear and potent, unscathed by these minor lapses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthousekeeping, vibration theory, and botany is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept transforms a familiar trope of loss into a unique, non-obvious angle. The risk-taking with lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
