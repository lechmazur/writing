<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the beacon's rhythm) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (proving her mother's concept) is earned by the specific, costly choice to use subtlety over the "brutal shout." The emotional progression is complex and rooted in contradiction, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the boat's course change proves her mother's concept, reconfiguring her understanding of her mother's disappearance with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from heat to cool dawn and the intensifying scent ritual. The cost is legible in the final image of the cork "still vibrating."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and night garden are not merely vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The specific combination of "cobalt glass, salt air, and the exact moment when night flowers surrender their scent" is the essential mechanism that purifies her intention, making the setting indispensable to the plot's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by the protagonist's agency in her ritual (adjusting the light, whispering into the cork, placing it in the fountain). This culminates in a decisive deepening that changes her knowledge and proves the stake. The cost is the emotional weight of her longing and the tangible risk of relying on whispers over warnings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of softness overcoming brute force emerges entirely through concrete events and images (the cork, the garden's scent, the heartbeat light) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the mother's disappearance as a transformation rather than a loss through the final, proven concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through vibration, scent, and memory. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and purpose-driven, with a rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variety. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting in the phrase "screaming tenderness," which slightly strains the metaphor, but it is a voice-motivated choice that does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper's duty with a concept of vibrational communication is a specific, non-obvious, and fully committed premise. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens the stakes and meaning, and the transformation of a generic "whisper vs. shout" theme through this unique, lived-in scenario feels both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
