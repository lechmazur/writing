<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coachman's characterization is deeply realized through specific actions (crushing seed pods, understanding bird calls) and a consistent motivation to reclaim the battlefield through growth. His internal conflict between grief and hope is embodied in the "narrow vastness" trembling inside him, culminating in an earned emotional shift when he feels it widen at the end. The lone tern's ambiguous gift (button) complicates his mission without simplifying his moral calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered imagery and symbolic actions that culminate in the resonant reconfiguration of the jetty's transformation. Closure lands with undeniable cost in the final image of the green shoot breaking through the plank, reconfiguring the coachman's internal state and the battlefield's meaning. The orientation is immediate and purposeful, with the coachman's arrival and task established within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The blooming jetty and dead reef are not just backdrop but active elements that constrain and charge the narrative. The environment directly shapes the climax ("the jetty creaked as roots took hold") and the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful—coral dust, phosphorescence, rotting kelp—all filtered through the coachman's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the coachman's agency under the accumulative lens, with each seed-scattering act intensifying the stakes of his ritual. The cost is legible in his cracked voice and the trembling "narrow vastness," culminating in the reef's acceptance of the truce. The dominant stake (reclaiming the battlefield before grief swallows the island) is signaled early and tightened through the tern's warning and the thinning "blood salt."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through potent images (seeds metabolizing gunpowder, battle-cry turning to pollen) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of regeneration after destruction, exemplified by the final shoot breaking through the plank. Subtext operates richly in moments like the tern's button—both gift and accusation—deepening the moral complexity without simplification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices "dialects extinct since the first cannon" and translates wind into lullabies. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the coachman's worldview. Purposeful compression (e.g., "narrow vastness") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "seeds sank, weighted by memory"). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though occasionally risked abstraction ("narrow vastness"). Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating in descriptions of the reef's response and slowing in reflective moments. Minor deduct for one instance of near-redundancy ("blooming jetty" and "flowering planks").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of fertilizing a battlefield with seeds is fresh and executed with high specificity. The synthesis of war memory and ecological renewal feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through grounded details like moon-moth wings in pods and anemones on helmets. Risk-taking in dense, poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, resonant conclusion.</comment>
