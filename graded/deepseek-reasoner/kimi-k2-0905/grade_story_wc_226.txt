<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's defiance, artistry, and complex guilt are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization and acceptance feel earned by the prior causality of the canyon's echoes forcing her to listen. The final choice to walk away is a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira accepts the cost, transforming the truth from a burden to be refracted into a shared story. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the density of echoes until the cadence shifts to listening. The cost is legible in the cracked spire and the feather.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire are not merely vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The spire's warmth, the mirror shard, and the mist are tactile tools integral to the ritual's mechanics and Lira's transformation. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from speaking to listening. The stakes—absolving blame—are signaled early and tested concretely by the canyon's refusal to provide relief until she pays the price of hearing her own echoes. The cost of acceptance is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness's cost is integrated flawlessly through action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth becomes a shared story, and cracks become bridges. The final image of the feather and doubled shadow reweights all prior material with profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's poetic, perceptive consciousness. The voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical rhythm that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The prose's texture is singular and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("The forged hush between sounds grew heavier than any sentence."), though it remains legible and charged. Otherwise, zero loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a defiant artist, a magical canyon, and a ritual of sound and light feels organic and fresh. The core concept—refracting truth through poetry and echo—is a specific, non-obvious angle on guilt and forgiveness. The risk-taking with structure and image heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
