<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—containing memory while accepting its impermanence—are dramatized through concrete micro-choices like carving the lion's closed eyes. Her final stance of "rust-hued peace" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the jar of sawdust labeled "Manes & Mettle."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where memory is reconfigured as both cage and key, with cost legible in the final image of the empty ring. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the dominance of this lens over a Causal one is slightly ambiguous, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skylight loft and ash wood blank are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The rain-beaded glass and the scent of sawdust are filtered through Mara's POV, shaping her tactics and culminating in the sentinel piece on the windowsill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from passive memory to active carving. The cost is unmistakable in the curl of wood that carries "rust-hued peace," the color of the sawdust that soaked up Emil's blood, narrowing her options to a stance of endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory as both containment and liberation emerges organically from the central conflict and the final image of the carving. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the concept of "here and gone" through the lion's open eyes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with a consistent first-person POV depth. Lyric compression ("here and gone") is taught early and paid off at closure. The voice remains coherent and specific under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("time crystallized") slightly slows momentum but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, artistry, and wildness feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choice to carve the performance transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
