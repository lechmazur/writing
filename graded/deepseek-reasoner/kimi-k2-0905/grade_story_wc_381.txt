<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, compelling high-stakes choices. His internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the moment he swallows the sphere of quiet. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of carrying the prophecy's weight. Some interiority verges on abstraction ("terrestrially adrift"), but his core struggle remains grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through the density of mapped silences. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallized in the final image of the sphere rotating in his chest. The cost is unmistakably legible on the page: "to carry quiet is never silent, that every smoothed hush still murmurs against the bone." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's goal. The brook and the cranes function as a micro-setting that accepts his offering and facilitates the climax. The environment subtly guides choice, though it could apply more tangible pressure on his tactics. The final image is charged by the "tranquil blaze of moonlight."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's active agency in mapping silence, a meaningful deepening that changes his options. The prophecy's counter-attack ("distant drumbeat") provides coherent external pressure. The cost of his victory is legible: he must internalize the nightmare. The dominant stake of hushing the prophecy is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of mastering internal fire emerges organically from the core concept and the protagonist's specific struggle. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze." Subtext operates powerfully in image and implication, utterly avoiding direct statement or moralizing. The integration is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a poetic, perceptive signature that modulates effectively under pressure. The patterned diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush") is taught early and pays off at closure. The purposeful elision of standard grammar in the spoken word “.” is a high-risk, high-reward choice that succeeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic, rooted in mud yet spiraling toward Polaris"), applying a slight deduction for density, but it does not obscure closure. The final paragraphs demonstrate masterful concision and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, prophecy, and silence mapping is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels organic and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, satisfying conclusion. Bold risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick. The perspective is highly memorable.</comment>
