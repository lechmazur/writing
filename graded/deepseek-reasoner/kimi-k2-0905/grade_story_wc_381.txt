<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is crystal clear and deeply rooted in a traumatic past, compelling his high-stakes choice to swallow the prophecy. His internal conflict is embodied in tactile, character-specific actions (folding cranes, feeling the paper's pulse) rather than alternating summaries. The final renunciation—swallowing the sphere of quiet—is earned by prior causality and carries a profound, visible cost as a "stone coated in honey" inside him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres and escalates through a density of hushed imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the summoner internalizes the conflict. The closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost: the sphere rotates in his chest, a "private galaxy" of mastered fire. The lens holds perfectly from the brook's quiet to the final, code-free dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The brook is not a passive backdrop but an active participant that "accepts the offering" and later "polishes prophecy." It constrains the summoner's choice, forcing him to step into its cold grip, and charges the final image as it sings without code. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered entirely through the summoner's urgent, hushed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's agency under the Accumulative lens: his act of mapping silence creates a vacuum that provokes the prophecy's coded counter-attack. This forces his ultimate, costly choice to speak the inverse word and swallow the sphere. The cost is legible and visceral, a weight he must "accept" and carry forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme—that tranquility is the mastery of blaze, not its absence—emerges flawlessly from the core conflict and is answered by the resonant final image of the internalized sphere. It is a non-literal, earned wisdom that reweights the entire narrative, avoiding any moralizing or thematic statement. The piece elicits a profound emotional aftereffect through its particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices "the space between heartbeats" and "the pause inside frog throats." The voice is consistently poetic yet purposeful, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic variety that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every image, like "terrestrially cosmic mirror," is precise and legible. The final paragraph's cadence is a masterful resolution of the story's accumulated pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, prophecy, and silence mapping is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its logical, daring conclusion without retreat. The risk-taking—a lyrical, almost silent confrontation—heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, resulting in a singular artistic vision.</comment>
