<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's monthly molt is a brilliantly specific trait that drives his choices under pressure, particularly when he shares his past selves with Marin. His transformation from "wanderer" to "lantern-bearer" is earned through concrete, high-stakes collaboration. The final choice to inscribe "Co-conspirator of light" is a perfect micro-choice that reveals a new hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses are present in his initial "joke feels thin" tremor, making his earned steadiness powerful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library becomes a "sovereign gap" and their collaboration crystallizes into a lasting, hopeful stance against entropy. The cost is legible in the "cooling ashes" of Lark's shed selves and the risk they just survived. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds density through layered imagery and symbolic action, all culminating in the potent final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rusted library is not just a backdrop but a crucible that actively constrains and enables their rebellion. Key objects—the coffee tin, the stove, the paper cranes—are integral to the plot and charge the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, from the "iron dust" in the wind to the "green, luminous" flames. The setting's decay directly opposes their act of rebuilding, making the environment a central actor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive density increase: the threat of bulldozers, the arrival of Rourke, and the act of burning the past selves. The dominant stake (preserving beauty/autonomy) tightens palpably. Agency is paramount; their clever, collaborative response to Rourke directly averts the threat and defines the new status quo. The cost of their action is the tangible loss of Lark's old skins, sacrificed to fuel their resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from action and image, avoiding any direct statement. The central tension between "beauty" and "anarchy" is tested and resolved through the specific, earned act of rebuilding the library into a "spiral reading nest." The final image of "patrons will stream out carrying paper wings" offers a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to Marin's question, "Can poems stop bulldozers?" Subtext is rich, particularly in their exchanged dialogue and the silent communication of burning the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lark's poetic consciousness, creating a distinct perceptual signature ("exhales iron dust," "words arrive jagged"). The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, with a rhythmic control that modulates perfectly with the tension. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot, as seen in their exchange with Sergeant Rourke. The prose's poetic compression is taught, purposeful, and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly integrated ("pages scatter like startled doves," "flames bloom green"). There is zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or register drift. The rhythm is masterful, propelling the reader through a high-information narrative without ever sacrificing clarity or momentum. A line-level triumph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept of "blooming resistance" is a stunningly original synthesis of biological renewal and political defiance. The monthly molt is a completely fresh, non-obvious mechanism for character transformation. The story commits fully to its premise, following the poetic logic of its world without retreat. The combination of a prison library setting, a penny poet, and a guard as co-conspirator feels singular and inevitable in hindsight, achieving a rare authenticity of vision.</comment>
