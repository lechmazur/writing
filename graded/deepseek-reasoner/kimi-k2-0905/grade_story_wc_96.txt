<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lark's molting is a profound, embodied metaphor for reinvention, and his final shift to "lantern-bearer" is earned through his collaboration with Marin. Their relationship acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter both their states. A minor deduction for the "blooming resistance" concept feeling slightly declarative in its introduction, though it is later dramatized beautifully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through image and pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure is masterful: the library becomes a "sovereign gap," and the final image of patrons carrying "paper wings" reconfigures the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is tight, with each beat layering meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is not just a backdrop; it actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (shelves, stove, dictionaries). The setting evolves from a place of decay to one of luminous resistance, constraining and enabling the protagonists' actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. The stakes transform from personal survival to collaborative, sovereign resistance. The confrontation with Sergeant Rourke is a masterful tightening where their rebuilt space and invented logic directly narrow options and avert disaster, with the cost of their precarious freedom felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of image and action: beauty forged from anarchy, resistance as a living process. The final answer is wholly non-literal and resonant, reweighting prior material without a hint of moralizing. The concept of "recycling the skins" but keeping "the bones" is a profound thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lark's poetic consciousness, with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and full of subtext ("tasting the bones, not the marrow"). Minor deduction for a few moments of densely figurative language in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are minor artifacts: a slight register drift in the phrase "luminous fracture against iron" feels slightly elevated for the POV, and a few sentences are exceptionally dense, requiring a re-read without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a molting poet and a prison library guard forging beauty from anarchy is breathtakingly original and specific. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking with a highly lyrical voice pays off by heightening stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
