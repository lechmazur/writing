<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mila's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait of diligence, and intensifies to compel high-stakes choices. Her final choice to amplify the dust is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she risks Ministry detection. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive Conceptual Repricing (CR) where dust becomes a carrier of stories, with undeniable conceptual cost felt as inspectors stagger. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure cohering through density increases that reweight the dominant stake. The final image of uniforms shedding ash makes the cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove and shortwave radio function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Mila's professional bias. The environment subtly guides choice through access and proximity, with the alcove providing cover for her clandestine work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through her nightly returns and the building anticipation of the solstice broadcast. The cost is unmistakable on the page as inspectors burst in but are overcome by the transformed sound. The dominant stake (restoring narrative) is signaled early and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of narrative famine through the image of dust whispering and passersby recalling dreams. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as inspectors mouthing newly learned words.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently lyrical and precise, reflecting Mila's copyist mindset. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and pay off at closure. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, though a few metaphors in peak beats ("green heart," "bled through") approach density without violating coherence. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent, with varied sentence openings and lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of music, censorship, and rebellion. The combination feels organic, not checklist-driven, with specific grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
