<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirage's characterization is rich with interior contradiction and embodied emotion, particularly in her admission "I mistook your depression for possession." Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though Julian's spectral nature limits full relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost as Julian dissolves into the scent. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, with the final image of the fading apology note reconfiguring meaning. The orchard's impending destruction provides persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and doomed orchard are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective, filtered through Mirage's professional bias, with the "faint hum of fluorescent lights" and "sap pulse like slow applause" creating vivid, integrated atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mirage's agency under the accumulative lens, tightening through dialogue and the written apology. Cost is legible when the apology note begins to fade immediately—"imperfect miracle exhausting itself." The dominant stake of redemption is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect redemption emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fading score and induced currents in future readers. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like Julian's spectral hand over the stain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a strong perceptual signature. Voice modulation under pressure is exquisite ("moonlight smiles on broken glass"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot economically. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("yesterday’s headlines like a shroud"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with emotional intensity. Sentence-level propulsion never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of supernatural and emotional realms. The gossip-exorcist premise is transformed through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
