<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her sensory perception ("taste the changing seasons on her tongue like copper pennies and wintergreen") driving micro-choices. Her transformation from skeptic to understanding is earned through on-page causality, culminating in a final stance that forecloses her old life with visible cost. The contradiction between her earthbound and cosmic natures is dramatized, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory and conceptual density toward a decisive Conceptual Repricing at closure. The cost is legible on-page in the final realization that redefines the weather-carriers' purpose. The three-shard structure (Mira alone, convergence, aftermath) is taught early and transitions are seamless, serving the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is fully integrated and constrains choice: the lavender bluff, aurora, and forest elections actively pressure the convergence and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Mira's unique perception ("tasting" the aurora), with the tin compass ring functioning as a micro-setting that evolves and directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her sensory investigation ("pressed it to her lips") actively narrows her options toward the convergence. The cost is felt in her transformed worldview and the burden of her new purpose. The dominant stake (understanding) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens through the carriers' arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the convergence event, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer about carrying collective emotion. The final image of "mapping not storms but people" reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the carriers' weather-manifesting traits and the forest's symbolic election.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature deeply tied to Mira's sensory world. POV is stable and consistently filtered through her particular lexicon and rhythm. The elevated diction is fully motivated by her "terrestrially cosmic" existence and never feels jarring or artificial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposefully dense, with high information velocity and rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("futuristic nostalgia lingered like perfume") slightly tempers the score, but clarity is never obscured. The closure image lands with unmistakable power and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather-carrying, forest elections, and emergent compass feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through grounded, specific detail rather than template plotting.</comment>
