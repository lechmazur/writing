<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, with her professional trait ("creeping normality noticer") directly motivating her discovery of the bread and subsequent choices. Her internal conflict between fear and hope is dramatized through tactile decisions like wrapping the bread gently and later planting it. The final stance—accepting her role as a cultivator rather than a passive witness—is earned through on-page struggle and cost, visible in her tears and soil-stained nails.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images (bread, tea house, gardening) that culminate in a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the sacred is revealed as continuous within the ordinary. Closure lands with cost as Mila tastes ordinary bread with tears, realizing her role is to "plant a memory before it rotted." The lens holds perfectly, and the final image of commuters lingering on shoots recharges all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated and constrains choice: the vanishing bakery, secret tea house, and guerrilla garden sites each pressure Mila's actions. The overgrown palace courtyard functions as a crucible where the bread is offered and the method is decided. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "flour ghosts," "soil under every fingernail"), and the environment evolves causally with the planting acts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mila's agency under the Accumulative lens: each planting act deepens the thematic weight and narrows her options toward a final stance. The cost is legible when she fears eating the loaf might "seal the amnesia" and later when she tastes crumbs and understands "bread is daily resurrection." The guerrilla gardening method forces a trade-off between passive observation and active cultivation, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the bread, the gardening, the curled signs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to finding the sacred in the ordinary through the image of "basil and marjoram" spelling old shop names. Subtext operates powerfully in the gardener's dialogue ("Guilt rises like yeast; plant it") and the final realization that absolution is "cultivated like thyme between cobblestones."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptive quality that mirrors Mila's profession. The prose exhibits a strong perceptual signature ("flour ghosts," "tea-steam sighs") and rhythmic control. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mila's consciousness. The gardener's dialogue is spare and subtext-rich, carrying thematic weight without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information economy and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("bread is daily resurrection"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the emotional cadence, and the final paragraph's syntax beautifully mirrors the thematic revelation. No artifacts obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "creeping normality noticer" with guerrilla gardening and magical realism feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical end, with bold risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of bread from evidence to sacramental object to seed is a non-obvious, deeply original inflection.</comment>
