<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (e.g., wanting to hurl the cloth yet folding it away). Her final choice to offer a workshop is earned by the causal chain of memory and realization, with the cost of her former life legible in the "mineral promise of foundations."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara chooses a new, meticulous purpose, with cost felt in the "bitter" dust and the foreclosed path of resignation. The accumulative lens holds, building pressure through sensory details and memory until the final image reweights her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quarry trailer and grille cloth function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Mara's professional and emotional biases (e.g., the crusher's "snare hit," the "mineral promise").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in her decision to call the school. The cost is legible in her renunciation of emotional insulation and the tangible "bitter" taste of dust, which signals the hard foundation of her new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of life after applause, answering the central question through the final image of "foundations" built to last. The reconfiguration is resonant and non-literal, avoiding moralizing while offering a complex, earned insight into purpose and need.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature shaped by Mara's expertise (e.g., "Mohs hardness scale," "sound wave that drooled"). The purposeful elision of her exact thoughts during the foreman's visit is taught and pays off in her subsequent action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor artifact exists in "confidently uncertain" appearing twice, but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ex-roadie, appraiser failure, and quarry setting feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative, reflective structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept is transformed through specific, grounded particulars.</comment>
