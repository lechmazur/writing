<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, rooted in her identity as a "curator of every forgotten thing," and intensifies credibly. Her final choice to display an empty cushion is a perfect Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path (solving the mystery) with a visible cost (the shop becomes a repository for unsaid things). Her internal conflict is embodied, not summarized, particularly in the line "the tale settle like dust between her ribs."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered rumors and details until a cadence shift (the communal silence) reweights the stake. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis); the mystery is not solved but "absorbed," reconfiguring the community's relationship with grief. The cost is legible in the final image of the offerings left on the velvet cushion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is not just vivid but actively pressures choices, constraining the action to a single, charged location. The mailbox itself functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's curator POV, as seen in her noticing "cracked ouds" and a "child’s tin soldier with one arm."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens: she actively collects stories, borrows a borescope, and ultimately chooses a new tactic (witnessing). This meaningful tightening culminates in the peak choice to sit in silence, which forecloses the option of opening the box. The cost is the transformation of her shop's purpose, a clear and felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme that "listening, not answers, is what finally heals" is fully integrated, emerging from the specific events of the story and the final, resonant image of the offerings. It offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing. The final line, "some locks exist only to teach us the shape of the key we already are," is a profound Conceptual Repricing that avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's consciousness. The prose rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating from the bustling rumors of dawn to the hushed silence of the climax. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("the calm of a sandstorm that has spent itself against mountains"). The rhythm is varied and propulsive, perfectly matching the story's accumulative build and quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a mystery plot with a quiet, psychological resolution. The core concept—a mailbox that contains a heartbeat—is highly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The risk of a resolution through communal silence instead of revelation pays off magnificently, heightening stakes and meaning.</comment>
