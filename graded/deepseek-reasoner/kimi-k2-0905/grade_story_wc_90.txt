<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's pacifism is a core, active driver of the plot, compelling her to create the sail and open the dimension. Her joy is complex and forged, carrying grief, making her final choice feel earned. The micro-choice to fuse her sorrow with the goddess's is a profound, character-defining moment that charges the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught immediately and held perfectly, with each image building toward the resonant reconfiguration of the final dimension. Closure is a decisive, on-page change with immense conceptual cost—the sacrifice of her former existence to become the archivist. The structure is a masterclass in lyrical, accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is not just a backdrop but a crucial element that pressures the action; its gravitational lightness directly enables the climax. Key objects—the photographs, the Tear, the gravity spinner—constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through the POV's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, through the act of stitching and the crystallization of her joyful resolve. The dominant stake—opening the dimension to redeem the past—is signaled early and tightens with immense, legible cost: the permanent forfeiture of her solitary existence to tend the archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core action of collecting and redeeming photographic "shards of collective shadow work." The final image of the ship as a "quiet lantern" offers a profound, non-literal answer to the premise of human extinction, reweighting the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The single POV is stable and deep. The only minor deduction is for a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor -0.1 deduction for a subtle template cadence in the description of the holograms ("flickered like candlelight over the faces of long-dried photographs") which is slightly decorative. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of post-apocalyptic, spiritual, and hopeful tropes. The core concept of using joy to counterbalance grief is a non-obvious, transformative idea that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
