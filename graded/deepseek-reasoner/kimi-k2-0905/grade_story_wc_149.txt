<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" trait is a masterful contradiction that drives her choices across lifetimes, and the boy's quiet competence is shown through his grafting skill. His final choice to accept her mercy is earned by the shared memory of forgiveness. A slight deduction for the boy's fear at the river feeling more stated than fully embodied in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the debt is repaid not by life or death, but by the dissolution of the tumor's blueprint and the ghost. The causal lens holds from her search to his salvation. The masters' arrival is a slight convenience, but it serves to trigger the final, decisive confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is indispensable, a micro-setting that pressures the boy's existence and provides the tools (grafting altar, poisoned fruit) for the climax. Sensory details like "tasted of rusted petals and mercury rain" are filtered through a specific, eerie POV, and the setting actively constrains and enables the final escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from her search to the immediate threat of the masters' harvest. The dominant stake—saving the boy from his lineage—is tested and paid for with her dissolution. The cost is legible and profound: "the ghost bride dissolving into the splash like salt into winter air."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from action and image: the paradox of mercy that looks like murder, and absolution through the same hand that caused the debt. The final image of the dormant orchard in spring is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights everything that came before without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice modulates beautifully under pressure, from the ethereal ("moon-dust") to the visceral ("cold as a tooth just pulled"). The single line of dialogue ("forgiveness") is perfectly placed and charged with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor repetition in the phrasing of "ephemeral cameo," but it does not obscure causality or closure. The final paragraph is a masterclass in concise, resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fresh, ingenious synthesis of gothic ghost story and alchemical fantasy. The core concept of a debt repaid by the original "murderer" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking with tone and structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
