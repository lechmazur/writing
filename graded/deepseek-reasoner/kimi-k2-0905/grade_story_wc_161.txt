<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between erasure and remembrance is shown simultaneously, not summarized. The final renunciation (leaving) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with dust motes and songs weaving a pattern that reweights meaning. The final image of the unfinished cadence invites future climbers, making cost legible. No orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choice (balancing on beams) and charges the final image (dust motes' ballet). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mirela's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting (skylight, dust) functions as a tool that shapes the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mirela's agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through the widening gyre of dust and the sending of songs. Cost is legible in her departure and the pulsing meteorite chip. The dominant stake (preserving echoes) tightens meaningfully, foreclosing her old life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (dust, songs, wings), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of identity and memory through the image of scattered notes becoming a quilt. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within Mirela's lexicon, and free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with poetic flourishes that serve the narrative. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, and the final line resonates without obscuring clarity. Minimal artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements (pigeon trainer, meteorite, dust mapping) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
