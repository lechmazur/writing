<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek's guilt and quest for forgiveness are embodied through concrete micro-choices (decoding the tapestry, righting the king). His final shift from solving to accepting is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the village's resumption of time. Interiority is specific and avoids diagnostic labeling, though the "fierce repose" motif slightly verges on thematic echo in its final recurrence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition (tapestry notation) deepens into a conceptual repricing of guilt. Closure is a decisive change (time snapping forward) charged by the resonant image of the righted king, with cost legible in the village's collective inhalation. The taught pattern of frozen time pays off cleanly at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is not merely atmospheric; it actively constrains Marek's choices and charges the final image. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are tactile, purpose-driven objects that evolve in meaning and directly enable his pivotal actions. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his strategic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening pattern of the decoded game, narrowing Marek's options from solving to witnessing. The cost is felt in the perturbation of the enchantment and the final, cleansing thunder. Agency is clear in his choice to walk the maze and complete the gesture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of chess and penance, culminating in the non-literal, resonant realization that "the board is wider than the mistake." The final image of the carried king and lifted threads offers a profound answer to the central question of forgiveness without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the woven notation and the labyrinth-as-mirror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a percussive, strategic rhythm that mirrors Marek's chess-trained mind. POV is stable and deeply embedded in his perception. The patterned elision of the frozen world is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon even at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language ("winnow guilt from memory," "thick felt") is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold appears in the near-paraphrase of "fierce repose" but does not obscure closure. Rhythm accelerates with the final realization, supporting the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy, frozen time, and emotional penance is highly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity. The suicidal king's gambit is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that transforms the narrative and charges the closure.</comment>
