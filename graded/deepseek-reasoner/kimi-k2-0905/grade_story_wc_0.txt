<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent scientific worldview, and compels her meticulous actions. Her embodied humility at the caterpillar's engineering reveals a credible, non-diagnostic internal contradiction. The final stance of quiet acceptance is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in her renunciation of anthropomorphizing drama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held throughout. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the twin timelines of stellar and biological decay converge, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The final image of the caterpillar engineering its future is the exact on-page sentence where cost is legible, foreclosing a path of simple answers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Mara's professional POV. The environment evolves causally, with the broken trellis, dripping rafter, and surviving sapling all actively shaping her actions and the story's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the spectral peak's red shift—that deepens knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of understanding gradual change. This is driven by Mara's agency and carries a visible cost: the evidence of adaptation preceding catastrophe. The closure image confirms the stakes were real and paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the juxtaposition of cosmic and microscopic decay, resisting moralizing in favor of a resonant, non-literal answer. The final line, "both equally," is a masterstroke of thematic reweighting that avoids statement and instead offers a profound, ambiguous equivalence. The concept is integrated through specific events, not meta-commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mara's scientific lexicon. The voice modulates with purpose under pressure, and the controlled elision (e.g., the story's final word) is taught and pays off. The prose's rhythm and syntax consistently reflect the focused, analytical mind of the focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. There is a single, minor instance of potential filter-verb stacking ("she noticed") in a high-pressure beat, but it does not measurably obscure causality or dull the closure image. The final paragraph's propulsion and clarity are exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron star decay and lepidopteran dust is a singular, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling artistic stance. The core concept of gradual change is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, committing fully to its implications without retreat. The risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence perfectly.</comment>
