<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The guardian’s transformation from a cataloguer of certainties to an entity befriending uncertainty is earned through concrete, embodied micro-choices (e.g., pressing her paw/hand against the frozen rose). Interior contradiction is vividly shown as she grapples with dimensional homesickness, and her final renunciation of a fixed identity carries a visible cost in her dissolution into the garden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through patterned imagery to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible in the pendant cracking and her integration with the garden. A minor orientation debt exists in the opening's deliberate disorientation, but it pays off functionally at closure, waiving the penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not merely decorative; it actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The frozen rose and sundial are micro-settings that force tactile interaction, and the mist's evolution into "pages turning" directly shapes the closure's meaning and cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to walk the perimeter and interiorize the garden deepens the stakes. The cost is unmistakable as her physical form dissolves, foreclosing her previous state with a tangible, conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from the core concept and imagery, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "attendance was the purest form of friendship." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature throughout, with patterned elision (e.g., "interiorizing exteriors") taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and deeply fused with the protagonist's consciousness, and the elevated diction is wholly motivated by her unique perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, though a minor instance of register drift occurs with "dimensional homesickness," which feels slightly academic but is quickly anchored in embodied experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a feral guardian, metaphysical concepts, and a lyric structure feels fresh and inevitable. Bold risk-taking in the abstract premise is fully committed to and executed with conceptual integrity, resulting in a singular artistic stance that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
