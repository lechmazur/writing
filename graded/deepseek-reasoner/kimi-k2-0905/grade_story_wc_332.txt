<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is clear and fierce, rooted in a private, specific longing that compels her high-stakes choice to risk a memory. Her actions align with her desire to restore voices, and her final choice to step into the tide and photograph the dream is a credible endurance with a visible cost. The only minor weakness is a slight abstraction in her emotional state ("hollowed by absence") at a pivotal moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through the dense layering of imagery and stakes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library pulses with coherent longing. The closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost—the cracked palette, the transferred image—and the lens holds perfectly. The horizon as a "shy animal" is a persistent constraint that shapes her tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is not a backdrop but an active, pressure-exerting participant. The coral shelves that hum, the movable horizon, and the sand ridge shaped like an open book all constrain Mireya's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action, creating a lived-in, tactile world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mireya's agency under the Accumulative lens, as each painted contrail of color and camera snap intensifies the stakes toward the decisive confrontation with the dream. The cost is legible and profound: the implosion of light, the cracked palette, and the transformation of her very body. The dominant stake of restoring lost voices is signaled early and paid off completely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of light, salt, and longing, resisting direct statement for a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of the library. The concept of "luminous absence" is fully integrated, reweighting the prior material without moralizing. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through its specific, earned imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Mireya's specific, poetic lens. Syntax and rhythm modulate perfectly with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression ("hollowed by absence") serves the accumulative pressure. There is no head-hopping, and every elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is masterfully crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. While the density of figurative language is high, it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive, never obscuring causality or closure. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. A single minor deduction for the slightly stacked modifiers in "luminous against the luminous absence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a librarian who shelves silence, a palette of compressed starlight, and a runaway dream that reshapes lighthouses is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed premise. The choices are bold and specific, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The story's vision feels singular and inevitable in hindsight, transforming its magical realist tropes through grounded, emotional particulars.</comment>
