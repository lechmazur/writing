<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is embodied and contradictory, compelling his high-stakes choice to confess. His final renunciation is earned by the causal weight of his mother's request. The mother's silhouette "fragile as the moment before stars appear" is a specific, character-particular image. A slight deduction for the mother's forgiveness feeling slightly pre-emptive, though her prior knowledge mitigates this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (confession) with immense felt cost, landing cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens. The final image of them "finally light enough" reconfigures the weight of the unsaid. Causality is airtight, from the encrypted request to the carved face. The orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are not just vivid but essential, constraining choice and charging the final image. The watch hand "cutting crescents" and the wood that "remembers its original shape" are micro-settings that shape the entire narrative. Sensory detail is selective and filtered perfectly through Elias's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the mother's request deepens the protagonist's internal conflict, forcing the search and culminating in the climactic choice to confess. The cost is unmistakable and legible on the page in the image of the carved, honest face and the "simple, terrible act" of truth-telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image—the "weight of a withheld truth" and "time dismembered" are answered by the final, resonant image of tempered regret. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of truth and fabrication without a hint of moralizing. Subtext operates masterfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the moment before confession, when the sky holds its breath"). The voice's lyrical, measured rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: "sieved hush" appears twice, feeling slightly repetitive, though it is thematically charged. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story and character. Figurative language is consistently sharp and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a black-market genealogist is brilliantly original and fully committed to, synthesized through specific, grounded detail. The emotional truth and complexity feel entirely authentic, not derived from a template. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight, a hallmark of high originality.</comment>
