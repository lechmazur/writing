<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's mute dedication is embodied through specific, tactile choices (e.g., "fingertips reading micro-oscillations"). Her final renunciation of speech is earned by the comet's passage and the sculpture's activation, a credible endurance with visible cost as she descends "pockets empty." Internal contradiction is shown, not told, through her fear that the earth is "forgetting" wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds perfectly, building toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a charged poise: the tuner's silent descent and gift of the wedge reconfigures her mission, passing the "frequency" to a new generation. The cost is legible in the "iceberg shrinking to a pearl of memory" and her emptied pockets. The structure is a flawless, single-scene accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture is the ultimate micro-setting, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful ("bronze wedges clacking," "ice sweating cold diamonds"). The bluff's environment actively pressures the calibration work. The setting is fully integrated into the action and central to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled ("preserve the color of wonder") and escalate through the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens. The tightening is the comet's approach, forcing the final calibration. Cost is unmistakable in the "thirty silent years" of labor and the physical relinquishment of her tools. The dominant stake is braided with a secondary, personal stake of her mute season "cracking open."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image: "wonder is not a feeling but a frequency." The final action—giving the wedge to the boy—is a resonant, non-literal answer to how wonder is preserved. The piece avoids moralizing, instead offering a profound conceptual repricing of silence as a "resonant cavity." The integration of concept and theme is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through the tuner's specialized, poetic perception. The voice has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure ("the entire frame sighed, a chordless inhale"). There is no head-hopping. The elision of her past is purposeful and paid off by her present-focused actions. The prose is character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and utterly precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with the comet's arrival. A single, minor artifact: "chatter finally overdosed her ears" slightly strains the metaphor, but it's an isolated moment in an otherwise flawless execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bell tuner, a kinetic sculpture, and a celestial event to explore wonder is profoundly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is executed with full commitment and authentic vision. The risk-taking—a nearly silent protagonist in a highly lyrical mode—heightens stakes and coherence magnificently. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
