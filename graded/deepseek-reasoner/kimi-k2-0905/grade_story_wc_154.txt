<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The translator's characterization is profound and contradictory, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to "unknot by naming" is earned by prior causality and the visible cost of shared guilt. The boy's "shrewdly innocent" trait actively constrains the interaction, creating a crucible that forces the translator's confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the premise of translation itself through the final, cost-laden image of the coral aligned with the plaster. The pattern of accumulating symbols (coral, cast, mist) is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost, making the story's logic feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the coral fragment function as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "droplets that fell with soft clicks on the banana leaves, each drop a syllable I had failed to interpret").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to the high-stakes action of vocal confession. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the translator's "pulse stutter[ing]" and the visceral "ache in my sternum" that opens outward, foreclosing the path of silent complicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of "sediment ready for new growth" reweights prior material without moralizing, offering profound ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The first-person POV exhibits a distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently anchored in the translator's professional and emotional lexicon, with purposeful compression and elision that pays off at closure. The boy's single line of dialogue is perfectly idiomatic and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor risk of figurative overload in one beat ("lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep"), but it remains coherent and serves the emotional intensity. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of war trauma, translation, and ecological memory is wholly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The unconventional, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, fully committing to its lyrical and conceptual premise.</comment>
