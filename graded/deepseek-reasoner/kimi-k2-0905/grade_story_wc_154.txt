<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("ache in my sternum—lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep"). The final renunciation (choosing to "stay" and translate) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as shared anxieties shift from "shrapnel to sediment." The boy's shrewd innocence credibly pressures the translator's micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered imagery (coral, knots, ink) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost ("shared anxieties shift... no longer shrapnel but sediment"). The final image (coral aligned with plaster) reconfigures meaning without breaking causality. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the mist-clad atrium and banana leaves constrain choice (world shrinks to "cot, coral, and child") and charge the final image (plaster growing "from the sea itself"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("droplets fell with soft clicks on the banana leaves"). The coral fragment recurs with reweighted meaning, constraining action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the decision to decrypt and voice the notes ("I unknot by naming") deepens stakes and forces a trade-off (grafting new meaning onto guilt). Cost is legible as the "ache in my sternum opened outward instead of inward." Pressure coheres through imagery until closure reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (coral, cast, translation) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: trauma becomes "sediment ready for new growth" through the act of speaking knots into story. Subtext operates in image and gesture (boy tapping the coral). Complexity embraces guilt without false redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("anesthetic hummed through my veins like distant shelling"). Diction remains within the translator's lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure ("syllables pool between us like rainwater in coral cups"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("Unknot them before the dark eats the words"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density (coral mirrors "gyres of shared anxieties"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, from lyrical to urgent. Final image resolves with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of war, translation, and ecology feels inevitable. Specificity (brain coral, ballpoint glyphs) avoids tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
