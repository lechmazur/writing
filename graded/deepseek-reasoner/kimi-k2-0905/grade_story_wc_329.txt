<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calla's micro-choices under pressure—her heart-rhythm signaling, playing the lullaby backward—are concrete, embodied, and reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation (leaving the seed) is earned by the causality of her musical tactics. A slight deduction for a somewhat abstract final line ("beauty... travels on its own legs") which feels more thematic than character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held; closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchard exhales and reconfigures. The cost is legible in the statue's final, frozen smile and the orchard's fundamental transformation. The locust shell's role as a memory, not a map, provides a subtle, earned twist that deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's crucible. The glass bridge, living statues, and singing trees are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The bridge's sway and the seed pulsing "the color of sunrise heard through closed eyes" are masterful, POV-filtered details that integrate setting with theme and character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Calla's agency under the Accumulative lens: each musical choice (skipping beats, playing backward) intensifies the pressure and narrows her options, visibly confusing the statues. The cost is felt in the bridge's tremble and the statues' final, permanent stillness. The dominant stake (reawakening beauty) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of breaking free from calcification emerges organically from the particular struggle with the statues and the gardener's echo. The final image of the orchard blooming outward instead of upward is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights everything without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the specific world and conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent and heightens under pressure ("tarnished wonder, as if childhood fairy tales had been left out in the rain to rust"). POV is strictly bound to Calla, and the purposeful elision of the gardener's full story is taught and paid off. The prose rhythm expertly conducts the story's tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in the phrase "a breathless pause that tasted of iron and apricot," which slightly abstracts a peak moment, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive without a single loop or scaffold artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a violinist, a locust-shell map, and mechanical statues in an enchanted orchard is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of using music and arrhythmic heartbeats to break a magical system is a fresh, non-obvious angle executed with high conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking that fully pays off.</comment>
