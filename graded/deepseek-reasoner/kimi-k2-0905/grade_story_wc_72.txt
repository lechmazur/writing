<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The statue's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction ("felt thought bloom inside my mineral skull like warm ink"). Its motivation to "welcome nuance" intensifies under pressure, compelling the high-stakes choice to shatter the ampoule. The final renunciation of its purpose as a sentinel is earned by prior causality, with the cost of its "calcified certainty" shedding made visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the city's certainties dissolve into "questions that glittered like suspended silt." The cost is legible in the final image of the statues "arguing gently," reconfiguring the premise of truth itself. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden is not just described but actively pressures choices, constraining movement and supplying the key object (the ampoule). It charges the final image utterly. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the statue's unique perception ("taste the grief of barnacles").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a density of revelations from other statues, culminating in the protagonist's decisive, agency-driven act at the arch. The cost is legible in the dissolution of certainty and the softening of its "stone skin," a clear trade-off that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core conflict between certainty and nuance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of living ambiguity, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The gardener's philosophy that "poison and remedy share roots" is perfectly integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a mesmerizing perceptual signature. The voice—lyrical, mineral, ancient—is perfectly calibrated to the protagonist and modulates beautifully with pressure. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent ("shedding flakes of calcified certainty"). Sentence-level rhythm is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of familiar elements (drowned city, sentient statue) into a singular, inevitable-feeling whole. The core concept of telepathic, cascading memory is fully committed to and drives the narrative with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
