<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live"). A credible endurance is earned, foreclosing the path of narrative salvation with visible cost. The eagle flight sequence is a dramatized micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values, though its immediate impact on her present tactics is slightly attenuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The final image of the scroll vanishing into the snow is a decisive Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable cost. The pattern of time folding is taught early and pays off cleanly at closure. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin and its contents (scroll, stove, snow) actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("lungs full of cedar smoke," "moonlight so sharp it sliced the snow into blue glass"). The setting is a crucible that pressures her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from confusion to a final act of renunciation. The cost is legible on the page in the dissolution of the scroll and her acceptance of the wheel. A single meaningful tightening—her decision to add to the scroll and then let it go—forecloses a live option with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of time as a wheel versus a ladder emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The final image of erasure as continuation offers a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's specific lexicon. Purposeful elision (the nature of the "dreams of strangers") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the closure effect. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling. A single minor paraphrase loop ("The act felt like signing a contract with erosion itself") slightly reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of dream chronicling and temporal dislocation. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its implications.</comment>
