<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between professional duty and personal curiosity is embodied and specific, driving her to stay and investigate. Her final choice to orchestrate the silent film apology rather than confront is a credible renunciation earned by her established scruples and the overheard revelation. The cost of her prior isolation and the weight of newfound trust are felt in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through the silent film, which reconfigures the relationships and the meaning of the lens with undeniable emotional cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through symbolic objects (ticket, lens, film) toward the final, wordless apology. The eavesdropping beat is a minor convenience but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "crystal whispering forecourt" and abandoned projection booth are not merely decorative; they actively pressure choices and supply the key objects (the grate to eavesdrop, the exit sign to hide the lens, the wet marble as a screen). The environment constrains and enables the entire resolution, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens: her choice to investigate the doodles, then to eavesdrop, and finally to project the film deepens the stakes from solving a discrepancy to healing a communal wound. The cost of thawing the long-standing mistrust is legible in the shared, silent sweeping at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: the projector lens and cryptic ticket are transformed from symbols of suspicion into instruments of reconciliation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of trust through the powerful image of the shared silent film, reweighting all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with Mira's quiet intensity, particularly in lines like "feeling the paper still warm" or "a resonant hush that felt like listening to snow fall upward." POV is stable and deeply filtered through her perception, with no head-hopping. The sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "the timeframe after words become unnecessary had begun" do multiple jobs—establishing mood, time, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence beautifully resolves the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—using a silent film to apologize—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of a mundane workplace conflict with lyrical prose and symbolic objects creates a singular artistic stance that avoids template plotting. The risk of a quiet, visual resolution pays off.</comment>
