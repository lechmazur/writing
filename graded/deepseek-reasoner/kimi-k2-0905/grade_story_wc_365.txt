<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The map maker's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. Her final decision to "chart not places but consequences" is earned by the on-page revelation of her complicity. Embodied emotion and micro-choices are consistently character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The only minor weakness is a slight diagnostic tone in the "weaponized while she slept" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost. The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal revelation, Accumulative sensory strands) holds perfectly. The final image of the bay as a "question she is finally ready to answer" lands with immense conceptual weight. Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but pays off at closure, waiving any penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The repair bay and green glass shard are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully reflects the POV's professional bias. The shard's cyclical song and the bay's "broken ribs" are not just description but active elements that shape the narrative. Spatial choreography remains coherent even during multidimensional travel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, with the shard's guidance forcing consequential choices. The dominant stake (discovering a withheld truth) tightens meaningfully with the revelation of her own complicity. The cost is legible on the page in the "encrypted grief" and the visceral "tremor in her wrist." A single, powerful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth's weight emerges organically from events and the final, resonant note. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material without moralizing. The core concept of sensory mapping is inextricable from the thematic question. Subtext operates powerfully in image and implication, particularly in the lover's locker and data cube.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the character's profession. The prose's lyrical, dense texture is voice-motivated and consistently legible. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "digest encrypted grief") are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift disrupts the singular perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistently purposeful and coherent, though one mixed metaphor ("loom" and "strands" slightly clash with "copper wire of her veins") prevents a perfect score. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel universes, and personal guilt is original, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar sci-fi tropes. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, non-linear structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its vision without safety-hedging.</comment>
