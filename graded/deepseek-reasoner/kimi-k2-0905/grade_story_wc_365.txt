<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The map maker's internal contradiction—her sensory gifts weaponized while she slept—is dramatized through concrete discovery. Her final choice to chart consequences is earned by the gut-digested cube and felt cost of complicity. Embodied emotion is specific, like the shard vibrating like a "trapped cicada."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: her maps funded the cover-up, reweighting her entire premise. The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal discovery → Accumulative reconfiguration) holds. Cost is legible: "she was the instrument" and the decision to redirect future commissions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The repair bay constrains choice (zero-g bracing, deck pressing) and charges the final image ("broken ribs settling"). Sensory detail is purposefully selective: dust tastes of "rust and forgotten fuel," and the shard's hum is a "private tuning fork against the void."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Hybrid lens: she actively steps into the loom, reaches for her younger self, and chooses to swallow the cube. The stakes tighten from personal longing to complicity in weaponization, with cost felt in her realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "Truth is the mass of what you still carry" is earned by the cube's encryption and her visceral digestion of grief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her decision to chart consequences, reweighting prior maps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by her profession: she maps "the precise ache of longing." Purposeful compression ("she swallows the cube like a seed") and rhythmic control under pressure ("cyclically spontaneous") are flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("weaving between worlds"). Syntax varies naturally, accelerating with discovery and breathing at closure ("the bay is quiet, yet inside her skull engines roar").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel universes, and corporate cover-up feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (loom weaving) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The green glass shard is irreplaceable, not a generic magical object.</comment>
