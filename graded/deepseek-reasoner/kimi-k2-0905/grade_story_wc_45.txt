<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion ("the cleft in certainty had opened right through her chest"). Her final choice to accept the changeling's invitation is earned by prior causality and micro-choices, with visible cost in her widened certainty becoming a door. The changeling's characterization is distinct and serves as a crucible, forcing her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the premise of mistakes with undeniable cost ("her heart a map of bright fractures"). The pattern of bone-setting and constellations is taught early and pays off decisively. Orientation is immediate and the single-shard structure is perfectly scaled to the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The garden, tooth, and splints are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Elara's PV ("smelled of bruised mint and iron"). The sundial carved from a vertebra is a stunning, irreplaceable image that crystallizes the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single, powerful deepening as the garden answers her plea. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the reconfiguration of her heart and the village's gossip. The dominant stake (certainty vs. forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of the heart as a "map of bright fractures" is a profound conceptual repricing that reweights all prior material. Subtext operates masterfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. The changeling's dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries distinct voice ("voice like wind through flutes"). Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, though a slight risk of overloading exists in phrases like "tasting chalk and thunder." Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with zero loops or scaffold. A minor deduction for one potentially mixed metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A rare, fully integrated synthesis of folklore and psychological depth that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "cleft in certainty" is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its singular vision.</comment>
