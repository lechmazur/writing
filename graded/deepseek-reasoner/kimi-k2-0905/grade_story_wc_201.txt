<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "discover the mathematics of mercy" is clear, concrete, and intensifies under pressure. Embodied emotion is exceptional ("proprioceptive spike twisted my knee sideways, gifting me the interrogator’s smile"). The final choice to leave the mask strap is an earned renunciation with visible cost, though the internal contradiction between seeking absolution and accepting approximation could be slightly more active in the final beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR): the final image of the mask as "any other piece of trash" reweights the premise of penance with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of mathematical equations builds density and culminates in the resonant final digit "1." Orientation is deliberately and effectively disoriented initially, teaching the pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is not a backdrop but the primary engine of the conflict, actively administering the "penance" and pressuring choices. The setting ("trunk that felt hot as a stovepipe") and a key object (the mask strap) crucially constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through the protagonist's altered perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification of the pattern (the successive equations) that reweights the dominant stake of achieving mercy. The cost of each step is legible on the page ("every stumble an outlier that threatened to collapse the whole theorem"). The protagonist's agency in walking deeper and ultimately making the offering drives the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of mercy as an asymptotic limit is fully integrated into the narrative's events and images, emerging from the protagonist's specific struggle rather than stated directly. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material without moralizing. The final line, "the forest had already forgotten me," provides a resonant, complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The first-person POV voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in mathematical and sensory metaphor. The patterned elision and compression ("a wavelength of guilt broadcast straight into the spine") are taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax and rhythm masterfully modulate with emotional and conceptual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly economical, with nearly every sentence advancing multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("administered communion in millijoules"), but it is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity or momentum at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi interrogation concept with a lyrical, mathematical quest for absolution is highly original and feels inevitable. The core premise of "ultraviolet penance" is fully committed to and explored through its specific, grounded implications. The voice and perspective are singular and memorable, taking bold risks that heighten stakes and coherence.</comment>
