<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, her academically rebellious nature driving her investigation. Her embodied emotion is strong, particularly when the fly amber warms, and her final realization is a credible micro-choice. The trait "academically rebellious" is stated rather than shown through a specific on-page action with a visible trade-off, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) as Mara reinterprets the visitors' mission, landing with undeniable conceptual cost. The Causal lens holds firmly from her initial questioning to her final understanding. The plot is tightly structured, with each discovery ("analyzer beeped," "amber grew warm") logically leading to the next.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully integrated, with the sculpture garden and bronze statue actively constraining Mara's investigation and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her POV, though a slight over-reliance on the visual ("glow faintly," "lights flicker") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, as each sample and measurement narrows her options and deepens her knowledge. The cost of her discovery—the threat of "artificial belonging"—is legible on the page. A single, powerful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict, exploring the commodification of human longing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of homecoming without moralizing. The fly amber and "bronze quiet" are potent, reweighted motifs that resist tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through Mara's perceptive, analytical voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. A minor deduction for a cluster of filter verbs in a high-pressure beat ("Mara understood then," "Mara understood that") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is excellent. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("question everything"/"reject the official narrative") and a cluster of filter verbs ("Mara understood") in the crucial realization beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of harvesting human emotion is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of sci-fi trope (first contact) with a deeply human, philosophical inquiry creates a singular and memorable perspective. Specificity elevates the premise beyond template.</comment>
