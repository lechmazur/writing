<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, driving strategic choices under pressure. Embodied emotion and micro-choices (testing arrow balance, scattering seeds with reverence) reveal character. Slight lack of on-page internal conflict in peak moments prevents a higher score, but patience and strategy are consistently demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (seeds planted as future resilience) with felt cost (regime's return implied). Orientation is immediate; decoding sequence and guard confrontation create tight linkage. Minor convenience in piano bench discovery slightly offsets perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Carnival setting is indispensable, constraining choices (mirror wall, netting tangling guards) and charging the final image (arrow flight over ruins). Sensory details (cellophane fletching, cracked earth) are selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (protect vault) escalate through protagonist's agency (decoding, distracting guards). Cost is legible when she scatters seeds instead of fleeing, accepting risk. Pressure tightens coherently under causal lens, though guard confrontation resolves somewhat quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically through images (seeds as liberators, chain as parade ribbon) without moralizing. Ending offers a non-literal answer through the sown seeds' promise. Subtext in gestures (pressing grains with childlike reverence) deepens emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and immersive with distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "sunlight pouring in like brass band music"). Lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with character's perspective under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("patient as drought-grass") enhances without muddling. Sentences advance multiple layers (plot, atmosphere, theme) seamlessly, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of carnival decay and seed vault resilience feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is fully committed to, with fresh inflections (decoding via music, cellophane arrow) that avoid tropes.</comment>
