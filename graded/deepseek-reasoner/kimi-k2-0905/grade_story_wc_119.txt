<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Chen's contradictory impulses as spy and sage are embodied in his micro-choices (palming film, writing the fortune). His final decision to leave is earned by the realization his prophecy applies to himself. The keeper is functional but lacks interior contradiction, serving more as a pressure source than a fully realized crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Chen's departure) with a resonant reconfiguration of the island's meaning. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered imagery (light, stone, secrets) to a final, inevitable cadence shift. The cost is legible in Chen's realization and the keeper's belated understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is indispensable, constraining choices (the beam's rotation dictates Chen's timing) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("granite spine," "salt wind," "Fresnel lens"). The environment is a active, tactile force that shapes the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Chen's agency under the accumulative lens: his decision to write the final fortune and then realize its personal application forces the climactic choice. The stakes—freedom vs. becoming a "note" in the island's enigma—are made viscerally felt and paid for with his departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "open secrets," explored through prophecy, espionage, and the lighthouse's signal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: true transposition requires leaving the stage. The final image of the humming island is a masterful conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Chen's perceptual signature ("white explosions that looked like negatives developing"). The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with rhythm modulating to match the contemplative and decisive beats. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional ornate phrasing ("strobe around him") that, while voice-motivated, slightly risks clarity. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of spycraft, prophecy, and lighthouse keeper is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core concept of "open secrets" is transformed through grounded, lived detail. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
