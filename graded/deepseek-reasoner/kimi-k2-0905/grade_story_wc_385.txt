<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her descent into the nexus. Her internal conflict is embodied in sensory details like tasting "iron in a stranger's blood memory." The final choice to complete her mother's farewell is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the cocoon's dissolution and the acceptance of "portable endings."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira learns to "finish," foreclosing a path with the felt cost of her mother's final words. The orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the serpentine nexus payoff is functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "serpentine nexus" and "breathing gallery" are not just described but actively pressure Lira's actions. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, like the "scent of wet copper" and "transparent moths," filtered through her perceptive bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to decisive action. The dominant stake (avoiding a hollow echo) tightens through her discovery of the cocoon and the cost of completing the farewell. The final price is legible in the "webs of intrigue loosened" and her "pockets full of silence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central question of "why do you echo," answered through the non-literal, resonant realization that "unfinished departures loop." The ending offers a profound reweighting without moralizing, embodied in the image of "a door that shut gently, leaving rooms of air."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is lyrical and consistent, modulating with emotional intensity ("reed-blown melancholy"). The single line of dialogue from the old woman is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight ornate density in phrases like "serpentine nexus under starlight," though it remains voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of echo, perception, and unfinished goodbyes feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the moth-silk weaver and the seashell's coordinates. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
