<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear, rooted in her perceptive gift and fear of becoming a "hollow vibration." Her final choice to sing the farewell is earned by her established quest and the discovery of her mother's fate. The line "I echoed because I never finished leaving" crystallizes the internal conflict and provides a concrete, embodied cost. A minor deduction for a single instance of telling ("Understanding struck like cold water") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira completes her mother's unfinished departure, foreclosing her own path of accidental echoing with the visible cost of the dissolved cocoon. Causality is tight: the initial question drives the descent, and the discovered cocoon directly motivates the final, decisive action. The orientation is immediate and the pattern of sensory disclosure is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The canyon and nexus are not just backdrop but actively constrain and charge every choice, from the trail that releases older footsteps to the cavern that demands descent. The recurring seashell and the moth-silk cocoon are key objects that shape the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception ("scent of wet copper," "transparent moths").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a density increase of sensory and emotional details, culminating in the discovery of the cocoon. This discovery is a meaningful deepening that changes Lira's knowledge and narrows her options to one necessary action. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the cocoon and the "pockets full of silence" she gains, a tangible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of unfinished business versus complete farewells emerges entirely through the concrete particulars of the story—the echoing canyon, the mother's words, Lira's song. The final image of a "door that shut gently" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gestures like the old woman lowering her hood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature ("able to taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory"). The lyrical, elevated diction is consistent and voice-motivated, reflecting the character's mythic sensibility. There is no head-hopping. A minor deduction for a few complex sentences that slightly challenge parseability under pressure, though they remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught ("reed-blown melancholy"). There is a single minor instance of potential synonym churn ("webs of intrigue that tightened" / "threads drifting like thistledown") but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mythical echo singer, a metaphysical cavern, and a deeply human emotional quest feels fresh, inevitable, and wholly original. The core concept—unfinished departures causing echoes—is a specific, non-obvious angle on grief and legacy. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels earned and transformative rather than derivative.</comment>
