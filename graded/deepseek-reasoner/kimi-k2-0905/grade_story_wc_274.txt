<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is clear, rooted in a rediscovered purpose ("to preserve every story"), and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, as seen when her "pulse drummed louder than the ventilation fans." The final choice to upload the data is a decisive change earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of potential destruction making her endurance credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds strongly from the inciting incident (finding the letter) to the climax (uploading the data). Closure is a masterful Charged Poise; Sera's re-entry into the pod crystallizes the options and stakes with undeniable cost ("the library would either stand reborn or fall purified by flame"). The final image of her reflection as "half ice, half fire" is a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that actively pressures choices. The "echoing library under snow" and the "narrow shaft" are not just descriptive but constrain Sera's actions. The "live copper" and "dormant networks" are key tools that enable her method. The environment charges the final image, with "snow sifting from the dome’s ruptured seams" reflecting the unleashed chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Sera's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (truth vs. control) is signaled early and tightens with her decision, which irrevocably narrows her options and forces her back into cryo-sleep. The cost is unmistakably legible on the page in the "distant explosions" and the building vibrating with "footfalls of people rushing toward the snow-buried entrance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between preserving truth and wielding power. The story offers a resonant, non-literal answer through its final image and Sera's promise: "the words are already loose, and flame cannot catch what the wind carries." This conceptual repricing argues for the ultimate indestructibility of truth, a complex idea earned by the specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply embedded in Sera's perception, with a distinct, lyrical texture ("her exhalations became falling snow"). The voice modulates beautifully with pressure, from the "dizzying quiet" to the hissing copper and the final, whispered promise. There is no head-hopping; the focalization remains tightly controlled and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, with high information density. The line "each glass column humming with dormant networks of data veins waiting for an electric whisper" does multiple jobs. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor stacking (e.g., "a live coal in the sub-zero gloom" followed closely by "forgotten purpose now burned hotter"), which slightly slows momentum in early beats but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cryogenic archivist, a library-tomb, and "contraband truths" feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed through without retreat, resulting in a singular artistic stance. The risk-taking in the quiet, charged ending heightens the stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
