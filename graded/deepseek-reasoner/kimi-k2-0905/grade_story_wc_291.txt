<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The artist's face-blindness is a profound, embodied flaw that drives her methodical process and forces her to paint "from the inside out." Her final act of empathy and forgiveness is a meaningful change earned by her struggle, culminating in the micro-choice to lance the painted heel. The cost is felt in her acceptance of her own mind's "betrayal."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly from investigation to supernatural revelation. Closure is a decisive change (the bodies are recovered) with a resonant reconfiguration (the town's memory is "awakened"). The cost is legible in the final image of the artist's mind "already erasing the deputies’ faces" as she prepares to continue her work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry is a masterful, pressurized micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the POV, from "limestone ground into chalk" to the water releasing the "faint scent of gardenias." The environment is a crucible, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the artist's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (uncovering the truth) tightens through her methodical actions, culminating in the supernatural act of painting, which forces a revelation. The cost is the emotional weight of her task and the town's collective guilt she unearths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, perception, and empathy emerges organically from the core concept. The final image of the artist mixing "new pigment" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: truth is found not in faces, but in the essence of fear and loss. Subtext is rich in the "furrowed hush" and the unified opposites.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her condition. The prose is controlled and rhythmic, modulating with intensity. The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, as in "silence has a shape like any jawline." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. One minor figurative muddle exists: "giving the quarry the furrowed hush of a crime scene that had given up speaking" slightly mixes metaphors. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances the narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of a supernatural procedural with a profound character flaw. The premise of a face-blind artist solving crimes through painting is a fresh, non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity and emotional specificity. The risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
