<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("crackled in her chest like static"). The final choice to release the insect is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earning the quiet stasis. Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling a high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with felt cost ("her collarbone quiet at last"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density of imagery and pattern breaks. The final choice to release the insect reconfigures the meaning of her guilt and her tattoos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains tactics. The antique console and its drawers are integral to the plot, and the recurring object (amber) charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the console's menu providing a clear, consequential choice that narrows options. The cost is legible on the page in the slicing of the paper chain and the subsequent quieting of her collarbone. A single, meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of guilt and absolution emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the empty amber and "forgiven sleep." Subtext operates powerfully in the console's menu options and the realization about the lab's true purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistently poetic and precise, with non-standard grammar and punctuation that feel voice-motivated and legible ("the meteor hush of a night when time folded in on itself").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. A minor deduction for a potential figurative muddle in the peak beat ("its wings unfolding into a spectral crib mobile"), though it remains largely coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of "haunted firmware" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of constellation tattoos, lost sounds, and guilt is highly original and organic. Risk-taking in the poetic, conceptual style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
