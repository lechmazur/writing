<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("crackled in her chest like static"). The final choice to release the insect is earned by prior causality, showing a credible renunciation with visible cost ("the static softened into the hush of meteors burning out"). Contradictory impulses act in scene, particularly the tension between her guilt and desire for silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (RELEASE INSECT) that lands on the page with conceptual and emotional cost, reconfiguring the story's premise. The inferred causal lens holds tightly, with each beat ("tethered the amber," "selected RESTORE") driving the next. The final image of the empty amber provides a resonant, felt cost that charges the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively pressuring choices and charging the final image. The antique console and its drawers are integral to the plot mechanics and atmosphere. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("walls pulsed with faint echoes," "drawers sighed open"). The environment constrains choice and is inextricable from the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with each console selection narrowing her options and raising the stakes. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the letters form a chain, tethering her to her guilt. The dominant stake (silencing guilt) is signaled early and undergoes a meaningful, earned reversal through her final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of guilt and absolution emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "forgiven sleep." Subtext operates powerfully in the console's menu options, which represent internal moral calculus. The core concept of haunted firmware is fully integrated with the thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose is characterized by a controlled, poetic rhythm ("meteor hush of a night when time folded in on itself"). Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the narrative certainty remains strictly bound to the character's knowledge and perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences that advance multiple jobs. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in "haunted firmware," but it is taught by the story's logic and thus forgiven. The final paragraph demonstrates superb concision and momentum, bringing closure with a powerful, clear image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing and haunted firmware is a specific, non-obvious, and fully committed premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story takes bold risks with its metaphysical concepts and lyrical style, which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, emotional particulars, avoiding cliché.</comment>
