<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with his "stoically sensitive" nature driving micro-choices like the measured bloodletting. His final choice to sacrifice his sight is earned by prior causality and carries a visible, felt cost, embodying the theme that failure becomes genesis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with a resonant reconfiguration: the alchemist is physically blinded but gains a new, profound insight, a cost made legible in the final image of "new colors bloomed across the dark." The linkage from theft to transmutation to sacrifice is airtight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ember nexus and the crozier itself function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the alchemist's choices. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through his professional bias, such as the "fissures met like frozen lightning" and the scent of "myrrh and ozone."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the alchemist's agency under the causal lens, from the initial theft to the final, costly sacrifice. The dominant stake (interrupting destiny) tightens with each step, and the cost of his blindness is unmistakable on the page, altering his future tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of creative destruction emerges organically from events and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The creature's warning that "the next cage may be stranger" embraces complexity and lingers without confusion, deeply integrated with character and conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, perceptive signature with a controlled, rhythmic syntax that heightens pressure ("a cold bloom of data where hope should have been"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("hiss became hymn" feels slightly ornamental). Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold, and figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of alchemy, theology, and rebellion feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of creative destruction is transformed through specific, grounded choices, and the risk-taking—a bishop's crozier becoming a living creature—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
