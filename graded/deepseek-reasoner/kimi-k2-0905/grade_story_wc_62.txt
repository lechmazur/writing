<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is masterful, with interiority ("fiercely meditative") embodied in concrete action. Her final choice to carve the spiral is earned by the ghost's mentorship and her own values, culminating in a resonant renunciation that charges the closure. Her professional and personal motives are seamlessly integrated, driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The closure—Elara carving the spiral and the ghost's final whisper—lands with immense conceptual cost, reconfiguring the meaning of grief and memory. The taught pattern of retracing and spirals pays off perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not merely setting but a crucible that constrains and enables every choice. Its sensory details ("wet moss and rust," "glass panes rattling") are filtered through Elara's expertise and charge the final image. The avocado tree and burial cist are indispensable, active participants in the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are masterfully escalated through the accumulating weight of collective sorrows witnessed during the backward walk. The tightening deadline of the migration and the ghost's fading presence create coherent pressure. Elara's agency—mapping with the ribbon, tapping the tree—drives the escalation to a climax with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of retracing, avoiding any direct statement. The final image of the spiral gravestone and growing forget-me-nots offers a profound, non-literal answer to the shape of collective grief. The integration of the family's poems deepens the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic yet precise rhythm that never obscures clarity. The ghost's dialogue ("thundering calm") carries immense subtext and weight. POV is strictly bound to Elara's perception, and the lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances multiple jobs—atmosphere, character, plot—with rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language ("loosened teeth in the jaw of time") is consistent, vivid, and fully integrated, enhancing rather than obscuring the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver and spectral mentorship is fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded particulars. The choice of a spiral as the shape of grief is a brilliant, non-obvious risk that heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
