<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lantern maker's motivation is painfully clear and rooted in consistent, embodied grief. Her micro-choices—breathing in the dream, folding the cranes—are specific, tactile, and reveal a hierarchy of values under immense pressure. The final, quiet endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by the entire ritual's causality, with the cost legible in her hands finally smelling only of tea.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through dense, resonant imagery toward a Charged Poise closure. The paradoxical path (descending to ascend) is taught early and pays off thematically and emotionally at the end. The cost is undeniable in the final image of the cranes becoming "living lanterns" and the moonstone's dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is not merely described but is the engine of the plot and emotion. The floating stones, glass basilica, and dream-steaming tea bushes are vividly specific and actively constrain the protagonist's journey. The environment charges the final image, with the tea garden becoming the permanent home for the cranes/lanterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates masterfully through a single, profound intensification: the act of drawing the dream into her lungs and folding it. This is a massive, consequential choice that narrows all options to this one ritual, paid for with the visible cost of her "translucent ribs holding a galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</comment>The theme of processing grief through craft is fully integrated, emerging from the specific, gut-wrenching particulars of the ritual. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief is not erased but transformed into a light for others. The subtext in lines like "grief is only another kind of flame" is profound without being stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable, deeply internal, and the voice is exceptionally distinct—lyrical, precise, and saturated with the character's professional and emotional worldview. The perceptual signature is unwavering; every image is filtered through her specific lens as a craftsperson and a grieving mother. The prose is character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is stunningly dense and precise, with every image doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled. Rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating from the heavy, ritualistic pace of folding to the lighter, releasing flight of the cranes. A single, very minor synonym churn ("luminous torment" used twice) prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording technology, origami ritual, and a floating world feels entirely fresh and organic. The core concept is not a gimmick but the very mechanism of the character's emotional arc. The story commits fully to its singular, high-concept premise and follows its implications with breathtaking emotional honesty and risk.</comment>
