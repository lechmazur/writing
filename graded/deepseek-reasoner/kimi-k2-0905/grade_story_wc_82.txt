<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the final beat where the protagonist's hands smell of tea instead of kerosene. Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the high-stakes choice to inhale the dream. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A minor deduction for a moment of near-diagnostic language ("luminous torment" risks abstraction, though it is quickly grounded).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the final image of the tea leaf chimney. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pressure escalating through density of imagery and emotional cadence. The paradoxical path ("descend while ascending") is taught early and pays off at closure. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica are not merely vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is a crucible, forcing the protagonist's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a professional lens (e.g., "lantern-maker’s knees"). The moonstone and tea leaf function as micro-settings that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the folding ritual serving as a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake of grief. Cost is legible on the page in the image of "translucent ribs holding a galaxy." The dominant stake (transforming grief) is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's irreversible act of inhaling the dream.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of processing grief emerges organically through event and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: grief transformed into light for others. The origami cranes and final tea leaf chimney are earned particulars, not abstract statements. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, avoiding any moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the protagonist's profession. Diction and syntax are consistently controlled and purposefully compressed under emotional pressure. The voice modulates with intensity but never loses its specific texture. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control and high information density, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without muddle. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacting. The final line is a masterclass in concision and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording technology, origami ritual, and a floating world is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through character-specific detail. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
