<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is masterfully specific and embodied. Her "stoically sensitive" nature is dramatized through micro-choices (wincing at a gull's cry) and her core motivation to become an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" drives the entire ritual, culminating in an earned, resonant act of endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Structure is a single, accumulative scene with a profound Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural, building meaning through the ritual of placing notes. The final image of the "keystone" void and her inscription reconfigures the entire endeavor with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is not just a setting but the central crucible that pressures every choice. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("wet marble steps," "rusted chains... like censers"), and the environment actively constrains and enables Mara's actions, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset (diagnosing the pavilion's fate) and escalate through the accumulative ritual of confession. Each note placed is a meaningful deepening, a tightening of her personal and professional commitment, with the final keystone inscription serving as the ultimate, costly act of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of documenting absence and lost love emerges organically through concrete action and image. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the entire story as an act of preservation for "future scholars." No moralizing, only profound implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply immersed in Mara's perceptive, lyrical consciousness. The voice is distinct and controlled, with a rhythmic, almost liturgical quality that perfectly suits the solemn ritual. Diction is precise and consistently within her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Minor risk of overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "a stoically sensitive communion"), but the figurative language is largely coherent and serves the accumulative, textured drive of the story. No loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of conducting a structural survey via hidden confessions is brilliantly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of the professional and the deeply personal feels inevitable and unique, transforming the trope of the surveyor into a profound and memorable archetype.</comment>
