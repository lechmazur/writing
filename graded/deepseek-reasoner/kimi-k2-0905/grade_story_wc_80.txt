<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exquisitely rendered. Her "stoically sensitive" nature is not a label but a lived-in reality, evidenced by her wincing at the gull's cry as if from her own chest. Her motivation—to become an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams"—is dramatized through her specific, ritualistic actions of inserting confessions into the stone, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final choice to write directly on the stone is a perfect, earned crystallization of her renunciation, foreclosing a path with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is clear and held perfectly. The structure is a single, continuous scene where pressure builds through the density of Mara's actions and observations, culminating in the powerful resonant reconfiguration at the central dome. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of her lighter inkwell and the imagined future scholars. The one minor flaw is a slight abruptness in the insertion of her professional backstory, but it anchors her present motive and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is the story's crucible, masterfully constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and entirely filtered through Mara's professional and emotional POV—she reads the "code of hollows." The setting is active, from the lapping water at her ankles to the rusted chains and fissures she probes. The environment is not described but discovered through her goal-directed action, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as each note placement is a deliberate act that deepens the emotional and thematic stakes. The dominant stake—documenting loss—is signaled early and tightens with each confession, culminating in the climactic act at the keystone. The cost is legible in the physical act of writing and the conceptual price of her offering. It misses the highest band by a hair due to the quiet, internal nature of the conflict, though it is perfectly suited to the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the concrete particulars of Mara's actions. The concept of "interlaced absence" is not stated but lived, as she literally fills voids with the ghosts of relationships. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of mourning and preservation through the final image of future scholars discovering her fragments. It is complex, emotionally honest, and entirely free of moralizing or thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature that perfectly reflects Mara's worldview. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, modulating with the emotional weight of the moment (e.g., "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light"). POV is stable and deep, with no head-hopping. The prose's lyrical quality is taught from the first line and paid off magnificently at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary. The prose is dense and lyrical but maintains perfect clarity and momentum, with every sentence advancing character or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled (e.g., "swaying like censers that had forgotten their prayers"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. The read-aloud rhythm is flawless, and the final paragraph is a masterclass in resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story's originality is profound, synthesizing the concrete profession of a surveyor with the abstract archaeology of emotion into a singular, inevitable concept. The core premise is wholly fresh and executed without a single retreat or hedge. The choice to have her "document" by inserting personal confessions into structural repairs is a breathtakingly ingenious risk that heightens stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
