<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma, and intensifies through somatic mapping. The final choice to live "as the trees live" is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak; interiority is concrete and particular, especially in the freezing exercise. Minor deduction for slightly abstract stake in "optimism anchored in realism."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of Nadia's laughter sealed in resin reweights prior material with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate; structure is a single continuous scene with one meaningful cadence shift. The cost is legible in the tears and the somatic map's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the arboretum constrains choice (thin soil, roots grip stone) and charges the final image (resin sealing the photograph). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. The dragon’s-blood pine’s resin becomes a tactile, lived-in object that alters the protagonist's stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens through the freezing exercise, which deepens understanding and narrows options. Cost is legible in the tears and the relinquishment of the photograph. The dominant stake (grief integration) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Minor deduction for stakes feeling slightly internalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events ("grief is a coastline to learn by heart"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The pearl of stillness motif is transformed through specific particulars. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, like the transferred photograph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, even under pressure. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("freeze is not paralysis; it is a microscope"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No loops or scaffold; clarity and concision are maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes trauma, somatic mapping, and arboretum imagery into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The core concept ("pearl of stillness") is transformed through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
