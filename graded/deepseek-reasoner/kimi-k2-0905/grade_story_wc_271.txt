<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s grief is embodied through somatic markers, a unique and concrete trait that drives micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—to live "damaged yet upright"—is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the transfer of the photograph to the tree. Contradictory impulses (optimism vs. memory) act simultaneously, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory density and emotional layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost: the photograph is lost, but her laughter is sealed into the tree, reconfiguring the protagonist's stance. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum is not just backdrop; it constrains choice (the outer path, thin soil) and charges the final image (the resin-sealed photograph). Sensory details are filtered through the protagonist’s grief, with the dragon’s-blood pine’s resin becoming a tactile anchor for the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency under the accumulative lens: the practiced "freeze" technique deepens into a transformative act, culminating in the deliberate release of the photograph. The cost is legible in the tears and the final, quiet resolution to continue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action ("grief is not a landmine... a coastline to learn by heart"). The final covenant offers a resonant, non-literal answer to balancing memory and optimism, avoiding moralizing. The pearl of stillness motif is earned and reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence ("the wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper"). Purposeful elision (the wedding strike details) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. The final paragraph’s cadence ("drinking salt and light") heightens closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of somatic markers, arboreal imagery, and post-traumatic grief feels fresh and inevitable. The central conceit (mapping plant names to hollow places) is a specific, non-obvious angle that heightens stakes and coherence, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
