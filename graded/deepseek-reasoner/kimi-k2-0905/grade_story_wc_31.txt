<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to "discover the color of sound" is clear and consistent, compelling his high-stakes dive. His micro-choices (leaving the ladder, diving, playing the cylinder) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final realization that sound was waiting to paint him is an earned, character-specific epiphany. A slight deduction for a minor motivational convenience; his lifelong quest feels more declared than deeply conflicted on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the revelation that "every human sound is merely light" reweights the entire premise. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory density to this resonant payoff. Causality is tight, with the key and cylinder serving as earned, taught patterns. The cost is legible in the final image of the pier lights now singing in colors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken library is not just vivid description; it actively constrains choice (breathing cautiously to avoid collapse) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful ("velvet" hush, "copper echo"). The environment is fully integrated into action and perception, with the wreck's "broken ribs" and "sleeping gulls" of books shaping the journey and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, powerful deepening: the discovery and playing of the phonograph cylinder. This act narrows Jin's options and delivers the transformative knowledge that changes everything. The cost is the foreclosing of his old quest, replaced by a new understanding that redefines his purpose. Agency is clear and drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of vows surviving dissolution emerges organically from the specific events—the festival, the key, the cylinder—without moralizing. The final image of the singing harbor lights is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is rich in gesture and image (the salt-stained uniform, the pressed lily). The piece elicits a profound emotional aftereffect through its particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Jin's poetic, professional perception ("copper echo," "color of sound"). The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with pressure without losing coherence. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying immense subtext. Purposeful elision (the woman's identity) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent ("meteor hush thickened into velvet"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Every sentence advances atmosphere and story. The read-aloud rhythm is flawless, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lamplighter, a sunken library, and a quest to hear color is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of luminous vows is transformed from a trope into a grounded, logical rule of this world. The piece commits fully to its poetic premise without retreat, achieving a singular artistic stance. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
