<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mateo's motivation is deeply rooted in his mortality, compelling high-stakes choices. His "gently systematic" nature is embodied through the diary and wiring project, culminating in a final act that integrates him into the ecosystem. The choice to close the circuit through himself is earned by prior causality with visible cost—his physical dissolution. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mateo integrates with the orchard, reconfiguring his relationship to time and life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through biological and technological details. Cost is legible in the final surge that lights the orchard, dissolving his "six-month horizon." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (diary entries) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "slow pulse of sap," "salt wind"). The environment actively participates in the climax, with the roots and copper wire shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mateo's agency under the Accumulative lens, as each species interaction deepens the circuit's complexity. The dominant stake (fostering interspecies respect) tightens through tangible negotiations (rat, cat). Cost is unmistakable in Mateo's final act, which forecloses his individual path. Pressure coheres and grows until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of human design and natural collaboration. The final image—"future and past became root and branch"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to mortality and legacy. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., the diary entries as "species negotiation"). Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mateo's perception. Voice is distinct and lyrical, with a perceptual signature ("moon silvered the stone"). Syntax and rhythm reflect his systematic yet visionary mind. No head-hopping; elision (diary entries) is taught and pays off. Diction remains within his lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "architecture of cells"). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: the synthesis of biological and architectural elements feels inevitable and fresh. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (copper wiring, micro-currents). Risk-taking in structure (diary entries) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the concept.</comment>
