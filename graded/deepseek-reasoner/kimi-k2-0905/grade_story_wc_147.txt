<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, rooted in guilt and a desire to harness the ephemeral, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the crystal vial and bruised knees. The final choice to sacrifice her last link to home is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A minor deduction for the organ's mechanism feeling slightly convenient, but it does not break closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the temple adopts her past as liturgy, with cost legible in her burning lungs and the offering of the empty vial. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern breaks. The organ's transformation is the decisive change, reconfiguring the temple's instinct. The final image of the temple singing her memories provides undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The underwater temple is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "cracked lapis tiles," "murals of whale-riders peeled like wet parchment"). The organ itself functions as a key environmental object that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single meaningful tightening: her decision to use the vial. The cost is unmistakable on the page—the fear she wasted her "last anchor to home." The dominant stake (survival/rescue) is signaled early and interwoven with the thematic stake of memory. Pressure coheres and grows until the final act reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus silence emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: a "single voice... can teach stone to yearn." Subtext operates powerfully in the transformation of the "gathered hush" into "cathedral-wide resonance." The core concept integrates with theme through specific, earned events like the organ inhaling the scented signal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity ("salt tears adding unwanted brine to delicate gears"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the voice remains coherent and specific to Mira's exhausted, determined consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences often do more than one job. A minor deduction for a slight figurative muddle in the peak beat: "a heart that had forgotten its rhythm" (the organ) is slightly mixed with the plankton "coughing" out, but clarity is not measurably obscured. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cartography, memory, and signal transmission. The combination of elements (perfume vial, coral organ, drowned world) feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
