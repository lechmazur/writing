<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to sacrifice her last connection to home. Her internal conflict—guilt versus duty—is embodied in bruised knees and the act of uncorking the vial. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost: she loses the vial but gains resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the temple's instinct to forget is overridden, broadcasting her memories. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through sensory details and pattern breaks (hush to resonance). Cost is legible: "lungs burning" and the lost vial charge the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is a micro-setting that constrains choice (stone tendrils snarl the mast) and charges the finale (organ amplifies the signal). Sensory details are purposefully selective—"cracked lapis tiles," "luminous plankton"—filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency: she chooses to kick deeper, pry open the organ, and sacrifice the vial. The dominant stake (survival via signal) tightens as time runs short, forcing a trade-off with visible cost (losing the vial). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: solitude transformed into connection through ephemeral beauty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"teach stone to yearn"—reweighting prior material (the vial's drop, the hush) without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("a trembling radio note that only Mira could still hear"). Diction remains within her lexicon, and elision (e.g., the rescue sub's arrival) is purposeful and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid with strong rhythm and sensory density, though slightly ornate in peak beats ("slowmotion thunder"). Minor figurative stacking occurs but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Read-aloud rhythm is compelling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater exploration, signal transmission, and scent-based communication feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode (e.g., "gathered hush") heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details like the coral-grown organ.</comment>
