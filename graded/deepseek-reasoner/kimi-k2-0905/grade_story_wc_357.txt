<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aera's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to share her memories feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor risk of over-articulation in the epiphany ("resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking") but remains dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing (resilience as process) with felt cost when Aera offers her memories. Orientation is immediate and functional. The arrow tip and gravity inversion create a coherent pattern that pays off. Minor deduction for gravity inversion feeling slightly convenient, but it integrates well with the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly anchored and pressures choices (water flows guide navigation, arches constrain movement). Sensory detail is purposeful and selective, reflecting Aera's expertise. The environment charges the final image (sapling with light roots). Micro-setting (arrow tip) constrains choice and reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering resilience) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase (accelerated plant growth, converging echoes). Aera's agency drives the escalation; cost is legible when she offers her memories. Pressure tightens meaningfully through the gravity inversion and arrow's use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (arrow tip, sapling, echoes), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication ("giving and taking are the same motion"). Avoids thematic echo despite final line's clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure. Lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within Aera's lexicon; free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity ("silver threads of water climbing like music scores"). Sentence-level rhythm supports accumulative texture. Minor deduction for slightly dense metaphor in peak beats, but clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gravity inversion, ecological resilience, and archival echoes feels inevitable. Specificity anchors universals (arrow tip, water navigation). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates.</comment>
