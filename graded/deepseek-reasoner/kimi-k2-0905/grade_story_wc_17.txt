<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is rich with embodied discovery and micro-choices, particularly in her tactile interaction with the negatives. The final transformation into the corridor feels conceptually earned by the premise but could use a slightly stronger motivational tether in the moment of choice to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cost unmistakably legible in the final image of the breathing room and the recurring job posting. The structure is taut, causality is pristine, and the taught pattern of inversion and recursion pays off perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The ivy-veiled passage, the tunnel of negatives, and the common room are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image with immense conceptual weight. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate beautifully from a professional mapping task to a personal, ontological crisis. The dominant stake of discovery is signaled early and tightens irrevocably with each revelation, culminating in a final choice/transformation with profound and visible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of inherited memory and burden. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the powerful final image, reweighting all prior material without a hint of moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently controlled, with a perceptive, almost synesthetic quality. The Accumulative lens justifies its density. A minor deduction for occasional over-richness in metaphor that slightly risks obscuring immediacy, though the pattern is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly inventive, with excellent read-aloud flow and high information density. It narrowly avoids being overwritten through consistent pattern-teaching, but a few moments of stacked figurative language in high-pressure beats slightly challenge clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, synthesizing climate fiction, gothic horror, and metaphysical mystery into a wholly unique and inevitable-feeling whole. The core concept of a building as a camera is a brilliant, non-obvious inflection that is committed to fully and without retreat.</comment>
