<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to whistle is earned by prior causality, and the cost of hidden labor is felt. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost on the page. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with a taught pattern of spirals and hidden rhythms paying off. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The parapet, fireflies, and bamboo whisk actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and personal priorities. The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of appreciating hidden effort is legible and paid on the page, altering the protagonist's stance and tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hidden effort without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext operating in implication. The final image reweights prior material with profound specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a clean, consistent POV. Purposeful elision and patterned diction are taught and paid off at closure. The voice is singular and coherent, with syntax reflecting the protagonist's state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional prose with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative pattern. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of hidden patterns is transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
