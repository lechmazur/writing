<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Character is fully realized through concrete micro-choices and embodied philosophy. The final choice to step onto the shadow path is earned by her established practice of "mending" reality, with visible cost in her departure from the village. Her internal contradiction—humble yet audacious—acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pattern density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final image of her descending a shadow path reweights the premise of "hidden effort" with undeniable cost. Minor deduction: the initial revelation of moon paths feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by her whistling action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated into action and choice—the mossy parapet, cracked stone, and harbor below all constrain her movements and charge the final image. The bamboo whisk and fireflies function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through her audacious act of "whisking moonlight," which narrows options and forces the final irreversible choice. Cost is legible in her departure and the rearranged moon paths left behind. Agency is consistently driven by her motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the net-mending metaphor and is resolved through the final image of stepping onto shadow—a non-literal answer to the question of invisible labor. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through the fishermen discovering their mysteriously mended nets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through her philosophical perception. Voice has a distinct rhythmic control, especially in peaks like "whisking moonlight itself." Minimal dialogue; the whistling calls function as action-oriented vocalizations that advance the plot without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity. Figurative language ("fireflies drifted like sparks from an invisible forge") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Minor deduction: "scintillatingly somber wonder" risks register drift but is quickly anchored by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of philosophical action and poetic imagery. The core concept of "hidden patterns" transforms the mundane act of net-mending into a metaphysical practice. Risk-taking in structure (single scene with accumulative density) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
