<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in his deliberate actions and micro-choices. His motivation—finding the color of his regret—drives a credible renunciation (leaving the compass) and a meaningful change (returning to speak). The final choice is earned by the lace's revelation and feels scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tutor steps across the threshold, feeling the "tides of remembrance recede, leaving fertile ground." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the pattern's discovery and the lace's transformation. Cost is legible in the act of burying the compass and leaving the tree behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The islet, lace, and compass function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the tutor's POV, with the environment (tide, salt wind) directly influencing the action and revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a single, meaningful deepening: the lace's pattern is revealed to be a map, reconfiguring the tutor's understanding of his journey from exile to "a long pruning." This is driven by his agency in breathing onto the fabric, and the cost is felt in his act of surrender and return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of remembrance, silence, and growth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the severance was "a long pruning," and apology is an act of return and offering. The lace and its cerulean color resist tidy moralizing, instead functioning as a complex, earned symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose is consistently voice-motivated, employing purposeful compression and patterned diction ("rose, vacancy, rose") that is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and consistent, serving character and atmosphere. There is no evidence of loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai, ghost ships, and woven apologies feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
