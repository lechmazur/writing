<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong, with concrete interiority and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her "functionally creative" trait is embodied, not just stated. However, her final act of giving away the sextant feels slightly less motivated than her preceding engineering choices, a minor but perceptible softening of her pragmatic core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative). Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the terminal's meaning is reconfigured from farewell to welcome. Causality is tight from the sextant's discovery to the beacon's activation. The cost is legible in the "unbudgeted sound" and the retrofitted structure, making the reweighting of the premise undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a character, constraining and enabling choices at every turn. The "maze of intentions" is not just described but is physically navigated and ultimately solved. The terminal's "forgotten circulatory rhythm" and the final image of dripping "cool light" charge the closure with tangible, reconfiguring detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the hybrid lens. The stake (finding hope) is signaled early and tightens as she reroutes flows and reactivates the beacon. The cost is the effort and ingenuity expended, legible in her "smile without happiness." A single, powerful deepening—the terminal's transformation—is perfectly sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of re-purposing and redefining hope emerges organically from concrete action and image, never stated. The final reconfiguration of "departure gates" into "arrival gates" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. The integration is flawless and profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that blends engineering precision with poetic wonder ("math proves kindness is structural"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's professional lens. The lyrical compression is taught and pays off magnificently at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, never muddying clarity. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. The final paragraph is a model of concision and resonant propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil engineering and existential hope is original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed through with bold specificity. The stoic, wonder-filled tone is a fresh and coherent artistic stance.</comment>
