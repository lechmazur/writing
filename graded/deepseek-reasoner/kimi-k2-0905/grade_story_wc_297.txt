<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("scars began to itch"). The final choice to protect the new covenant is a credible renunciation, though the gardener's dialogue feels slightly detached from the protagonist's established agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost (the scar transformed into a living maze). The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building pattern density toward the final image of the "constellation of miniature suns."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and the scar itself function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a covenant rekindled. The cost is legible in the physical transformation of the scar and the shift in the glade's nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of time and dreams, resisting moralizing. The final image of the flower offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of broken promises and forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a powerful perceptual signature. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. The single line of dialogue from the gardener is the only minor, forgivable convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level control with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of fantasy and metaphysical inquiry. The core concept of an "eclipsed covenant" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
