<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("recited primes under my breath"). The final renunciation—accepting ambiguous loss—is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost ("lighter than when I arrived"). Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost ("no body, no farewell—but the equation now possessed a limit I could approach"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pattern density toward a cadence shift that reweights the stake. The stepping stone's opening is a decisive on-page change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is indispensable, constraining choices (climbing the "gnarled calcite trunk") and charging the final image ("the mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through the POV's professional bias ("coaxing absence into measurable shapes"). Spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening (the eyes' alignment triggering the stone's opening). Cost is legible on the page ("weight resolve into warmth"). The dominant stake (understanding loss) deepens through a cadence shift that reweights options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of ambiguous loss emerges through events and images, not statement, offering a resonant non-literal answer ("the equation now possessed a limit I could approach"). Subtext operates in implication ("Grief is an unknown variable"). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("coaxing absence into measurable shapes"). Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, even under pressure. Purposeful compression ("gently inventive") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("liquid starlight, pooling at my feet") but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mathematical and emotional concepts feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
