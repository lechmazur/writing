<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and particular, with her father's backstory anchoring her present choices. Her "decisively kind" trait manifests in micro-choices like touching the daughter's shoulder. Interior contradiction shows in her professional serenity versus personal hope. The final renunciation—carrying both pieces—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the lightning-bolt vinyl image reconfigures "reunify" as carrying both pieces. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building through sound patterns. Orientation is immediate; the taught pattern pays off at closure. Cost is legible in the daughter's weeping and Mara's sternum beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cloud-level ward functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (isolation, transition space) and charging the final image (city as single organism). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—bleach, petrichor, warm vinyl. Spatial choreography is flawless; the skybridge midpoint crystallizes the theme. The setting is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens: hymning mundane sounds deepens into hymning hope itself, forcing Calderon's release. Cost is visible in the monitor's quiet ocean and the daughter's raw eyes. One meaningful tightening (sound → scent transformation) forecloses options with felt price. No coincidence; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the vinyl shard and "reunify" concept, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: carrying both pieces forward. Subtext operates in gesture (tracing vinyl like braille) and image (lightning-bolt fracture). Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality; the hope scent is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "pulse fluttered like a trapped moth"). Lyric compression is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Diction remains within Mara's professional yet poetic lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("each beep a small stone dropped into deep water"). Minimal artifacts: one slight overwork in "pulsing stillness" (redundant) but no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with Calderon's passing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hospice care and music therapy feels fresh yet inevitable. The broken record concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices (e.g., using it as a tactile anchor). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
