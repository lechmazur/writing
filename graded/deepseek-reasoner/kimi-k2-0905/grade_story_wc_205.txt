<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurelio's characterization is deeply rooted in his defunct revolutionary status and poetic inclination, with embodied emotions (pressing the shard until blood beads) and micro-choices under pressure. His final act of scratching the mirror is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. Mira serves as a secondary pressure source, though her development is appropriately limited for the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building through imagery and thematic density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The scratched line on the mirror reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, and the storm's pause creates a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the mosaic structure (two shards: Forum/amphitheater) is taught and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is indispensable, constraining choices (storm covering mirrors) and charging the final image (cathedrals flung into vacuum). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("time dripped from gutters like liquid brass"), filtered through Aurelio's poetic bias. The mirror functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: Aurelio and Mira's decision to uncover the mirror during the storm tightens options and reveals the catastrophic vision, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the future destruction image and Aurelio's relief, foreclosing paths with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars (mirrors, shard, storm) without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer to memory and time through the rewritten poem line, reweighting prior material with resonant ambiguity. Subtext operates in gesture and image (blood-smeared shard, multiplied reflections).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic-perceptual signature ("burnished sorrow," "liquid brass"). Diction and syntax reflect Aurelio's worldview, and purposeful compression (e.g., "ribbons of chronal lightning braiding themselves into nooses") is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding artifacts or loops. The final image ("letters rearranging themselves into languages no human throat had ever shaped") demonstrates clarity and propulsion without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of baroque asteroid, time storms, and archaeological dispute feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density and conceptual ambition heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus (footnotes in collapse).</comment>
