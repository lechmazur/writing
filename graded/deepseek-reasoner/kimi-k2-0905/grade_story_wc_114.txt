<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oracle's characterization is masterfully embodied and specific, with her contradictory impulses ("needed its exact weight before it sprouted") driving the entire narrative. Her final renunciation is earned by a clear hierarchy of values and a visible, felt cost ("4.7 grams of sorrow"). The only minor flaw is a slight abstraction in the line "tasting of auroral light just before it breaks," which edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The plot is a taut, causal chain from inciting incident (swallowing the seed) to climax (expelling the stone), with a clear Decisive Change and a resonant, costly closure. The drive lens is Causal and holds perfectly. The orientation is slightly delayed but functional, teaching the pattern of disorientation that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is an indispensable, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated into action and perception ("Snow hissed against the shutters; the anemometer spun above, counting heartbeats no one claimed"). The setting itself becomes a crucible and a map.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven relentlessly by the protagonist's agency under the Causal lens, with the internal weight climbing ("heavier—like a pulse inside stone") forcing a series of consequential actions. The cost is unmistakable and visceral on the page ("the first rootlet pierce her diaphragm"). A single, powerful tightening is executed perfectly for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: the weight of truth and the cost of protection. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer through the final image of the stone and the logbook entry, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The integration of concept and event is flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic precision that heightens pressure ("green ropes dragging violet scars across the sky"). The single POV is stable and deeply embodied. The elision of the stranger's details is purposeful and taught, paying off in the final realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistently sharp and coherent, serving character and atmosphere. A single, very minor strain exists in "tasting of auroral light," but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure's power.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original and executed with audacious specificity. The synthesis of oracle, weather station, and botanical illustration feels inevitable and indispensable. The risk-taking in the lyric, embodied style heightens stakes and coherence without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
