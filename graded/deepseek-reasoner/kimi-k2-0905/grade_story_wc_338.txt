<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity and empathetic motivation are consistently embodied through concrete actions like comparing footage and touching stone. Her final realization about silence as language feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her renunciation of documentation. The micro-choice of sitting cross-legged to merge images demonstrates values hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly as pattern recognition escalates toward conceptual repricing. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the projectors are destroyed yet she carries "shielded openness." The map's edges knitting together "in slow fiber-years" provides resonant reconfiguration that reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices throughout - the rain erases work yet enables revelation, the fresco vault reveals layered history, the chapel doorway functions as both obstacle and invitation. Sensory details are purposefully selective (rain hissing, mineral hush, stormlight beam) and fully integrated with action. The environment charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density as patterns coalesce. The dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens through her progressive quieting and observational breakthroughs. Agency manifests through attention and renunciation rather than force, with cost legible in the destroyed equipment and transformed perspective. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of maps/silence being reconfigured. The final image of the "map framed upside-down" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like palm-pressing stone and the knitted parchment. Complexity embraces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable and deeply embodied with distinct perceptual signature ("each drop a soft hammer erasing the day's work"). Lyric compression serves accumulation pattern. Diction stays within character's professional lexicon while achieving poetic precision. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language consistently serves pattern recognition ("a scream wearing silence"). Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively between contemplative and revelatory beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Closure image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography, archaeology, and metaphysical inquiry feels inevitable in hindsight. The central conceit of silence as language transforms familiar material through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes rather than diminishing them. No derivative echoes or safety-hedging.</comment>
