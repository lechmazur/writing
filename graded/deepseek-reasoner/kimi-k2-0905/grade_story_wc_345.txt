<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's altruism is a consistent, embodied motive that sharpens under pressure, compelling her to use her limited ghostly abilities to orchestrate the harvest. Her final choice to leave is a decisive, earned renunciation with visible cost, felt in the "single note of release" of the bell. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, showing her contradiction through action, such as proving her love by knocking down fruit only when hands are ready.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara dissolves into the nebula, her purpose fulfilled and her death repriced as a "reservoir of respite." The causal lens holds perfectly: her chalk messages directly lead to the colonists' coordinated action, which saves the orchards and binds them as a family. The cost is legible on the page in the finality of her farewell and the permanence of Kai's chalked message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not just vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the finale. The dying anti-grav seeds create the central pressure, the floating arches necessitate the human chain harvest, and the nebula's time-slowing property is the mechanism that tethers Mara and ultimately receives her. The butterfly garden and its bell are micro-settings that evolve in meaning, culminating in the final message written with "crushed butterfly-wing dust."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens. Her initial frost messages are a low-stakes test of trust that successfully escalates to a direct, physical role in the harvest ("becoming the counterweight"). The dominant stake—collective survival—tightens convincingly as the tilting arches force a riskier, more coordinated effort, with the cost of failure made tangible. The final, iridescent message is the peak choice that forces the terrifying yet thrilling collective action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the harvest: survival as a "collective verb" and "family is the crop we keep replanting." The concept is fully integrated, with the nebula of respite and the ghost's purpose serving as the literal and metaphorical machinery for this exploration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting Mara's death as a beginning for the community, without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perception, creating a distinct, ethereal voice with a lyrical but controlled rhythm ("its tone brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire"). The patterned elision of her ghostly limitations (can't hold chalk, can't lift) is taught early and pays off at closure. There is no head-hopping, and the prose remains consistently within the story's melancholic, hopeful register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and purposeful variation in sentence length and structure. There is a single, minor instance of potential register drift in the phrase "brambled hope," but the metaphor is consistently developed and ultimately pays off, justifying its use. The closure beat is crystal clear and unmarred by any artifice, with the final line serving as a perfect, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with a sci-fi survival plot is fresh and non-obvious, executed with high conceptual integrity. The combination feels inevitable, as the ghost's limitations and the planet's magical-scientific rules create a unique crucible for exploring community and grief. The core elements are fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices, such as using frost for writing and butterfly dust for pigment.</comment>
