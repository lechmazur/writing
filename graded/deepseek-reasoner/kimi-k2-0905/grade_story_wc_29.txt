<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, though her specific backstory with the tricksters is lightly sketched. Her final choice to swap to chaotic glacier sounds is a brilliant, earned micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The "cautiously hopeful" trait is embodied in her actions and the final tagline, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); the cost of temporary, fragile peace is legible in the "bewildered eye-contact" and the "slow heartbeat of the planet... waiting." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through sensory density and a decisive cadence shift at 02:19.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the radio station's "burnt solder and decades of vinyl dust" and the "gritty bass line" of the generator constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's professional expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are sharply signaled and escalate through coherent pressure under the accumulative lens. Lyra's agency drives every turn, from the initial counter-wave to the final chaotic choice, each narrowing her options with visible cost (dimming lights, SWR meter in the red).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict: interference as a potential act of love. The final image of "returning civility" and "grit... become a cradle" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized; the prose has a distinct, gritty, ethereal texture that modulates perfectly with pressure. The perceptual signature is exceptional—e.g., the subsonic pulse is a "velvet migraine," the moon a "chipped silver coin."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistently sharp and coherent ("dawn the color of old bone"). Rhythm and syntax expertly accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic conflict, radio technology, and small-town strife is wholly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "subsonic frequencies" influencing conflict is a fresh, non-obvious angle executed with bold risk-taking and full conceptual integrity.</comment>
