<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and a clear hierarchy of values revealed under pressure. The final choice to break the mirror is earned by the established causality of her seven-year struggle and the cost is legible in the scar. The locksmith's internal conflict—fear versus the need to free the idea—acts simultaneously throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through dense imagery and pattern (seven gates/knots/years). Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: she gains her voice but bears a permanent scar. The orientation is immediate and the pattern of the ritual is taught early, paying off in the transformative ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a vital, pressure-applying character. The shadowed nexus, frost-slick marble, and gate swallowed by ivy are not just atmospheric but constrain choice and charge the final image. The keyhole shaped like a human ear is a masterful micro-setting detail that directly dictates the protagonist's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from hesitation to the decisive act of cutting the mirror. The cost is unmistakable: the physical scar and the scattering of her name into futures she cannot claim. The dominant stake (freeing the idea) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to silenced ideas emerges organically from the specific, charged particulars of the ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of children finding locks that open at a touch, tying the personal sacrifice to a universal legacy without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lyrical, precise voice has a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through the locksmith's professional and personal longing. The controlled elision (e.g., the hint as temperature, not word) is taught and pays off. POV is stable and deeply embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. The final line is a powerful, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a locksmith freeing an idea—is a singular, ingenious synthesis. The specific execution, from the lock of hair to the ear-shaped keyhole, feels inevitable and utterly irreplaceable. The story commits fully to its lyrical, conceptual logic, achieving a rare authenticity of vision.</comment>
