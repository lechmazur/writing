<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("informally wise," rebellious). Her actions—tasting memories, planting the seed, pruning—are concrete and character-particular. The final choice to distribute the fruit is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her blood offering and the Ministry's pursuit. Her internal contradiction (rebel with self-knowledge) acts in scene, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the greenhouse's transformation and the citizens' awakening) with a resonant reconfiguration of beauty and rebellion. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and symbolic density. The cost is legible in the Ministry's disarmed arrival and Marisol's planning the next heist. The celestial alignment provides a coherent, taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is a micro-setting that constrains choice (knees grinding into rust, dry soil) and charges the final image (transformed building). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Marisol's professional POV (tasting rust, seeing leaf scars as sundials). The environment evolves causally with events, from decay to renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the celestial alignment providing a live clock that tightens decisions. The cost is unmistakable: Marisol's stolen seed, her blood offering, and the Ministry's crackdown. The dominant stake (rewiring collective memory) is signaled early and deepens through her actions, culminating in the citizens' awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of beauty from decay emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed greenhouse and the citizens' reactions. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "gentle rebellion," "stubborn photosynthetic heartbeat"). The piece invites reflection on memory, authority, and renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., reading the wind by loose bolts, trusting recipes like star charts). The voice is lyrical but controlled, with rhythmic variation. Purposeful compression (e.g., "synaptic plasticity") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with vivid imagery and rhythmic control. However, slight density issues appear in peak beats (e.g., "volatile molecules that drifted... dreamless sleep" could be tighter). No loops or scaffold artifacts. The final image is clear and resonant, though a few phrases border on over-written.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory, rebellion, and botany. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices (e.g., pruning as metaphor). The story commits fully to its premise, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical density that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
