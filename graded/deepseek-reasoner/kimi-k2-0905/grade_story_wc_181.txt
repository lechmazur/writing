<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("heart hammering") and a final micro-choice (slipping the shell into her cheek) that reveals her hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict—excitement sharpened by dread—acts simultaneously throughout, and her philosophical breakthroughs provide concrete, character-particular grounding for her ultimate renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Lira's refusal to carve the shell and her burning of Quell's memories redefines nonlinear inheritance, with the cost legible in the "unmade choices" left on her tongue. The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds, taught by the bathroom pattern and paid off by the final image of trees blossoming with "possible selves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard and translucent outhouse are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is a crucible: the orchard's memory-fruit forces Lira's cataloging mission, and the bathroom's specific mechanics (mirror liquefying, light-stairs) enable her descent and ultimate choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Hybrid lens. Her inquiry to the mirror triggers the descent, and her choice to not carve the shell is a major tightening that forecloses the path of grafting herself into the orchard. The cost is felt in the dissolution of the shell and the burning of the fruit, which alters the state of the orchard itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image, resisting moralizing. The final reconfiguration—that inheritance can be "pruned, redirected, refused"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, earned through Lira's specific bathroom breakthroughs and the cost of unmade choices. The pistachio shell's transformation from key to silent cameo is masterful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("starlight-dappled petals that hummed like tuning forks"). The voice modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (Quell's image glitching) serves the closure. The single line of dialogue from Quell is goal-driven and rich with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("sunlight on a scalpel" slightly clashes with the story's organic, astral tone) prevents a 9+ score, but it does not harm closure clarity. There are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of astral orchard, nonlinear inheritance, and bathroom breakthroughs is wholly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is not just a backdrop but the engine of the plot and theme. The risk-taking—especially the final, quiet refusal—heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
