<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity and contradictory impulses ("reported neighbors for insufficient smiles, then later forged joy coupons") are dramatized in scene. Her final choice to plant the stems and narrate the watering is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the officer's transformation. The officer’s shift from potential arrest to participation is a credible, embodied emotional progression under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the planted stems and the flapping wrapper reconfigures the valley's silence with a felt cost of endured grief. The pattern of whittling, narration, and the crow's interventions builds density that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The turbines and farmhouse porch are a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("the turbines groaned overhead," "petal fragments tore away, flashing like old confetti"). The environment constrains action and subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to plant the stems and narrate with an empty can forces a meaningful cadence shift, reweighting the stake of cultivating lightness with a visible cost—the officer joining her and the sky's single tear. The cost is legible in the soil darkening "as if remembering rain."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the final reconfiguration of grief as soil and hush as a shovel. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of cultivating lightness, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the officer's scratched-blank badge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("a television left on after the station signed off"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext in the officer's question and her reply.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor risk of overwriting in a few phrases ("an infant made of endings"), but the figurative language is coherent and serves the closure effect. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-mandate world, whittling, and dramatic narration is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "remade hush" is transformed through grounded, particular choices in character and world. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
