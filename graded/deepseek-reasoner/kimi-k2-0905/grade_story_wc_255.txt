<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Milo's colorblind desperation and Rosa's rough-voiced practicality are rendered with concrete, contradictory interiority. Their micro-choices under pressure—the trade, the garden arrangements—reveal a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of painting for a living gallery is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through patterned exchanges (object trade, garden language) to a decisive Conceptual Repricing at closure. The final image of the planted reed tongue and colored rain is a resonant reconfiguration that makes the cost of their shared awakening legible and permanent. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The courtyard and its objects (reed, marble eye, plants) are indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through professional POVs (glassblower, painter). The environment evolves causally, from phoenix ash to spiral garden, mirroring the internal arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the coded garden conversation and the final collaborative act of creation and destruction. The cost is unmistakable: Milo's altered vision is "imperfect, fractured," and their smashed creations become the medium for their final statement. The dominant stake (finding beauty) is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific particulars of the trade, the garden, and the smashed glass. The final, resonant answer—"beauty wasn't found in perfection but in the courageous act of remaining broken"—is earned, non-literal, and reweights all prior material. It embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature for each character. The prose has a lyrical, precise texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity. The non-standard communication method (plant arrangements) is taught early and its mechanics are integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphorical phrasing in peak beats (e.g., "the violence of it, the way broken things sing louder"), though it remains legible and serves the voice. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of concepts (bartered awakenings, colorblind painter, communicating through gardens) is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, transformative conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
