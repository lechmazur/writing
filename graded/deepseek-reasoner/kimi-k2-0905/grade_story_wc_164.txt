<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is vivid with embodied emotion ("her gloom felt cheerful") and micro-choices that reveal values. Her final choice to plant seeds is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for interiority that could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) with clear cost: the cave seals, its job complete. The final image reweights the premise that paths disappear only when unwalked with wonder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crater glass are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and integrated into action, reflecting Lira's priorities perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a decisive act of creation. The cost is legible as the cave seals behind her. A minor deduction for the cost feeling more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and images, culminating in the resonant, non-literal realization that "paths disappear only when no one walks them with wonder." Avoids moralizing, offering a profound answer through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a strong perceptual signature. The lyrical, compressed style is taught early and pays off at closure. Minor deduction for occasional over-written density in peak beats that slightly obscures immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("sand rose in a slender whirlwind, painting a fresh path midair") that borders on overwriting without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable, a hallmark of high ingenuity.</comment>
