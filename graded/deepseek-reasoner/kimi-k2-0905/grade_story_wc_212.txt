<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("borrowed time grated against her ribs, rough as tree bark"). The final stance of the archivist is an Earned Stasis, a credible endurance foreclosing a path with visible cost ("She would not pass through"). Micro-choices under pressure, like surrendering her own heat, reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost ("archivist of the moment after hatching"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure cohering through density increases and a cadence shift. The final image of the dome as a "snow-covered heart" reconfigures the initial promise-breaking starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is a masterclass in micro-setting that actively pressures choice and charges the final image. It constrains tactics (scattering seeds on ice) and supplies a key resource (the cold the oak's roots drink). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, perfectly filtered through the POV's expertise and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through a decisive intensification: her act of "decreasing entropy by surrendering her own heat." The cost is unmistakably legible on the page ("borrowed time grated against her ribs"), altering her tactics and charging the final image of enduring as the archivist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of inheritance and debt ("Every inheritance is a debt; pay by planting what you cannot bear to lose"). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through the protagonist's chosen endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's expertise. Purposeful compression ("velvet over iron") and patterned diction are taught early and pay off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, though a minor risk of density appears in the "velvet over iron" beat. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion accelerates in step with the scene's needs. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ecological and magical elements that feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise, with specific, verifiable detail creating undeniable freshness and authenticity of vision.</comment>
