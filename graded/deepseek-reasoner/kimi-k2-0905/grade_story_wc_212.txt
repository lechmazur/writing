<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt its weightlessness, and understood that borrowed time felt like silk soaked in dawn"). The final choice is a credible, complex renunciation (circulation) earned by prior causality and her grandmother's memory, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost ("half its spiral spun into the seeds and half into her own heartbeat"). The final image reconfigures meaning and stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and acorn cap are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception. The environment shapes every tactical move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear, meaningful tightening (vortex awakening forcing her choice). Cost is legible on the page in the splitting of the bead and the transformation of the seeds and herself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preservation versus circulation. The final image of the fractured acorn cap "full of spirals" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with minimal artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative pressure. A minor paraphrase loop ("wild serenity" used twice) prevents a perfect score but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic and ecological elements feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, high-concept premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific lived detail anchors the universals.</comment>
