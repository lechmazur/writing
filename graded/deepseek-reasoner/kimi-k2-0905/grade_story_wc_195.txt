<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as seen when he kneels because "knights do not weep standing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the page with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of his past failures shapes the final image of planting the seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is a micro-setting that actively constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception, such as the "frost etch[ing] the inside of his visor."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible on the page. The dominant stake (capturing possibility) tightens meaningfully through each reality shift, culminating in the final choice to plant the seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question ("what would you harvest if failure were merely compost?") that reweights prior material. Theme emerges organically from events and images, avoiding statement or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture and rhythmic propulsion. The perceptual signature is strong and selective, though minor register drift in peak beats ("factually mystical") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and clarity. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the highest-pressure beats, but figurative language is largely coherent and serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of knight, puppet, and alchemical greenhouse is a specific, non-obvious, and highly original concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
