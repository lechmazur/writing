<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion under pressure. Her micro-choices, from trading her future for the past to the final broadcast, reveal a clear hierarchy of values with immense cost. The final choice is earned by prior causality and her established flaw: the need to decrypt her mother's past at any cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a decisive change (broadcasting the truth) with undeniable conceptual and personal cost ("futures closing like doors"). Causality is airtight; each beat builds on the last through the parley mechanism. The lagoon's rule-set is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is the ultimate micro-setting, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purpose-driven, filtered through Mireya's archival expertise. The environment is fully integrated into the plot, serving as both crucible and key.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is masterful under the accumulative lens, driven entirely by Mireya's agency. The parley is a series of high-stakes trades that narrow her options and raise the cost with each exchange. The dominant stake (truth vs. personal future) is tested relentlessly, culminating in an irreversible choice with a legible, devastating price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of encrypted memory and the cost of truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of names becoming "unerasable" reweights all prior material, landing with profound emotional and thematic impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptional signature shaped by Mireya's archival mind. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful elision (the diary's contents) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving character and atmosphere. Sentence-level rhythm is controlled and varied, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Minor deduction for a slight density spike in the final paragraph, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The core premise—a retrocognitive lagoon that encrypts memory—is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world logic and moral calculus. The story commits fully to its implications, resulting in a fresh, inevitable, and deeply memorable narrative.</comment>
