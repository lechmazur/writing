<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's characterization is masterfully embodied through specific professional habits and visceral reactions to the lagoon's projections. Her final choice to broadcast the truth feels earned by prior micro-choices and the visible cost of years rearranging inside her. The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation of the lagoon's function in the line "I understood: the lagoon did not merely remember..." which briefly edges into diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with each exchange of future for past tightening the narrative's grip. Closure is a decisive change with immense cost: Mireya's voice becomes "kerosene onto a ready flame," irrevocably altering the political landscape. The final image of names becoming "unerasable" is a flawless conceptual repricing of the lagoon's function and the cost of truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is the quintessential setting-as-antagonist, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, from "hot glass-grain" sand to the "ink bubbling" in the memory. The environment is fully integrated into the plot's mechanics, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate relentlessly through Mireya's agonizing trades, each offering a more personal fragment of her future. The cost is visceral and legible on the page: "I felt years rearrange inside me, futures closing like doors." Agency is never in question; every shard of the past is earned through her active, costly parley.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of encrypted memory and the cost of truth. The final act answers the central question of what truth is worth without moralizing, through the potent image of spoken names making the vanished "unerasable." The mother's betrayal adds profound moral complexity that avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a perceptive, archival lexicon. There is a single, almost imperceptible moment of slight POV drift when the narration states the lagoon was "retrocognitively trapped," which feels slightly more omniscient than Mireya's immediate, embodied discovery. Otherwise, control is exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and flawlessly precise, with every image serving multiple functions. The metaphor of the voice as "kerosene onto a ready flame" is searing and original. There are zero loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating toward the climactic broadcast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a retrocognitive lagoon, a floating library, and a political archive is breathtakingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is executed with full commitment, transforming familiar themes of memory and truth into a singular, ingenious mechanism that drives every beat of the plot.</comment>
