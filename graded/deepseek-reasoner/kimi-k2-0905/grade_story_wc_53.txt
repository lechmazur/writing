<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses (scavenger vs. dreamer) are dramatized in scene, and the final choice to break the camera wheel is earned by the prior causality of collected regrets. The embodied cost is felt in the line "I feel the cold in my ribs—regret is just empathy traveling backwards." The ghost relationship serves as a perfect crucible, forcing a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the ghost dissolving and the narrator stepping on alone reconfigures the central conflict with a clear, felt cost of accepted decay. The pattern of collecting and releasing story fragments is taught early and pays off cohesively at the end. Orientation is deliberately disoriented but functional, serving the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and carousel are not just backdrop; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting pressures the negotiation ("cloudwater rises, thickening into silver glass") and the obsidian horse functions as a crucial tool for anchoring. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Each click of the camera wheel and spoken story fragment represents a meaningful deepening that narrows options and increases emotional cost. The stakes—negotiating with one's ghost to resolve eroded ambitions—are signaled early and paid off with a visible price in the dissolution of potential futures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</theme><comment>The theme of reconciling past and future selves emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the carousel, camera, and ghost. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "emulsified dreams," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the ghost's hand passing through the coat lining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in lines like "every hiss sounded like a syllable of my own name spoken backwards." The voice's lyrical, compressed quality is consistent, pattern-taught, and serves the accumulative design. There is no head-hopping; the single focalizer's consciousness is fully realized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "regret is just empathy traveling backwards"), but the pattern is taught and the clarity at closure remains unharmed. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a surreal, floating carousel with a deeply personal psychological negotiation is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
