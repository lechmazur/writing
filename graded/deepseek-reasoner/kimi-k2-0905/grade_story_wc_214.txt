<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in his grief for a planet that forgot to look up. His final choice to leave the station open is a credible renunciation earned by the vision's causality. The trait of spiritual curiosity drives his empathetic actions, creating a meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the janitor's internal change reconfigures the station's purpose, with cost felt in his reopened chest. The accumulative lens holds, building through pattern and cadence shifts. The vision is a decisive, causally-linked turning point that narrows his options toward his final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The station and lantern glass are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the janitor's perception. The yellow glass's transformation is integral to the closure, and the environment subtly guides his actions and ultimate decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the janitor's agency under the accumulative lens, his practice of empathy deepening the stakes. The cost is legible in his wept understanding and the traded glow of the lantern. The dominant stake of finding connection transforms through a meaningful cadence shift during the vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the janitor's actions and the meteor's question, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about strength in vulnerability. The final image of the yellow afterimage reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly the meteor's silent query.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the poetic, precise prose. The voice modulates with emotional intensity, maintaining rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, accelerating with scene needs. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, and the final line resolves with a resonant image that recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the cosmic and the mundane. The combination of a janitor and a sentient meteor feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
