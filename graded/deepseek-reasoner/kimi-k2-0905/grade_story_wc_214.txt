<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling at the telescope, speaking apologies to stars). The final renunciation—leaving the lantern—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The emotional progression from grief to openness feels credible and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The vision sequence is the decisive turn, paid off by the janitor's final acts. Cost is legible in the traded glow and the reopened chest. The pattern of stillness and observation is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The station functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes, sigh of the dome). The yellow lantern glass is a recurring object that evolves in use and meaning, directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the janitor's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to empathy to transformative vision. The cost is unmistakable in the traded lantern glow and his reopened chest. The dominant stake (finding meaning in fragility) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about strength in vulnerability. The final image of the heart-shaped afterimage offers profound thematic closure without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The elision in the vision sequence is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor overwriting in phrases like "dark dialects of iron and ice" slightly strains clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of cosmic and intimate scales. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes and coherence. The final image feels inevitable and unforgettable.</comment>
