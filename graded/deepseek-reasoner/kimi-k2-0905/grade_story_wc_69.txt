<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is masterfully embodied through concrete actions (humming, kneeling, pressing ear to wood) that reveal her internal contradiction as a silenced peacemaker. Her final choice to sacrifice her voice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her physical posture and the rosette's destruction. The trait "expectantly resigned" is demonstrated, not stated, through her posture and knowledge of the council's choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's silent endurance becomes the city's "root tone," reconfiguring the premise of harmony through subtraction. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through density of sensory details and cadence shifts. Cost is legible on the page in the rosette's crumble and the "unfamiliar tenderness" neighbors hear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The velvet library and rosette are indispensable micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (cedar, candle smoke, saffron, iron) are purposefully selected and filtered through Mara's professional perception. The rosette's physical properties ("drank the lamplight") actively shape tactics and the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, using the rosette to subtract noise and collect syllables. The dominant stake (unlearning hatred) tightens through a meaningful cadence shift at midnight when she must offer her voice. Cost is unmistakable in the rosette's acceptance and diminishment of her song, stripping it to "pure interval."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The theme of harmony through subtraction emerges organically from concrete actions (Mara's method, the rosette's function) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer: silence as the "root tone." The final image of the circle of untouched dust offers a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and images, like the rosette drinking light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices musical and sensory frequencies. The prose rhythm modulates expertly with pressure, using elongated sentences for accumulation and shorter phrases for pivotal actions. Purposeful elision (e.g., the council's decision) is taught early and pays off in the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits masterful rhythmic control and high information density, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the empty circle immediately drank the lamplight, creating a quiet so complete it felt like velvet turned inside out"). Zero loops or scaffold; every image advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent, legible, and charged, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of "vanishing arts" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the rosette's mechanics and Mara's method. The synthesis of musical theory and emotional resolution feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
