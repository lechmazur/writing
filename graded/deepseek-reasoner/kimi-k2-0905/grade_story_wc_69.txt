<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is flawlessly embodied through specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. Her final sacrifice of voice is earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. The "expectantly resigned" trait constrains her choices authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with the rosette's crumbing and the city's transformed heartbeat providing a decisive, felt change. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The velvet library and the zither rosette are not just vividly described; they actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The rosette's function as a "micro-setting" is indispensable, directly shaping the climax and resolution with immense specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is masterfully driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from listening to humming to the ultimate sacrifice of her song. The cost is unmistakable and deeply felt on the page, both in her personal loss and the city's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The theme of silence as an active, subtractive force emerges organically from the particulars of the rosette and Mara's method. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of hatred, reweighting the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose exhibits a distinct, controlled, and poetic perceptual signature that remains perfectly consistent under pressure. The lyrical compression is taught and purposeful, paying off at closure with immense power. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with precise, vivid language. The final line is a masterclass in resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "vanishing art" that subtracts noise is a profoundly original and non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without ever obscuring clarity.</comment>
