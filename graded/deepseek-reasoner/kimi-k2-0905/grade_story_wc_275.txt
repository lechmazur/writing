<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptional, with her contradictory inheritance of a bounty hunter's perceptive eyes and a pacifist's gentle hands dramatized through concrete action. Her final choice to weave her father's violent legacy into her peaceful garden is a profound micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values and earns its cost. The only minor deduction is for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language, e.g., "inculcating plants with values of peace," which briefly abstracts her method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/lyric lens is clearly taught and held, building pressure through density of image and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the hybrid rose transforms the premise of violence and peace into continuity, with the cost of acceptance legible in the act of planting. The orientation is immediate and the pattern payoff is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass-domed greenhouse is not just a vivid setting but the story's central crucible, constraining Mira's world and charging every choice. The cracked dome, the blood-soaked earth, and the roses themselves are active participants that shape the narrative's outcome. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and filtered through Mira's specific, plant-tending POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: Mira's choice to graft the sandbag scrap onto the rose is a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake of continuity. The cost of accepting her father's violent thread is felt on the page. Agency is crystal clear and drives the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of grafting and weaving, resisting any direct statement. The final image offers a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of integrating opposing legacies. The story's emotional aftereffect is earned through concrete action and avoids sentimentality completely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to Mira's perceptive, plant-focused consciousness. The prose rhythm modulates with the emotional pressure, and the controlled use of figurative language ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze") is taught and paid off. POV is stable and deeply embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. There is no scaffolding or looped phrasing. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful, with a perfect final line that resolves and recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bounty hunter's legacy, pacifist horticulture, and a post-apocalyptic setting feels entirely fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "inculcating plants" is transformed from a potential gimmick into a profound philosophy through specific, grounded execution. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off spectacularly.</comment>
