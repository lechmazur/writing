<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is concrete and rooted in specific trauma ("heart ticked irregular since the eclipse that took his mentor"). His internal conflict is embodied in the flawed key and his doubt "hissed like thawing steel." The final choice to step through the door is a decisive change earned by his realization about the mirrors, with visible cost in the locked door behind him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Rowan steps into the memory of his mentor's workshop, his own pulse syncing with the restored clocks. The pattern of reflection and repair is taught early and pays off with undeniable cost—the vanished doorway and his smile at the overlapping ticks promise a new, irreversible role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are not just decorative; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The mirrors store "better versions" that Rowan must use to heal his key, and the final workshop setting, filled with "driftwood nostalgia," is the crucible for his mending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like his breath unfurling as "silver gauze."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens. The initial failure of the gears creates pressure, which deepens with Rowan's observation of the non-synchronized reflections. His choice to use the mirror to heal his key is the decisive turn that narrows options and leads to the door opening. The cost is legible in the locked door and his acceptance of a new, isolated role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of repair through integration and forgiveness emerges organically from the particulars of the lock, the key, and the mirrors. The final image of Rowan "custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock" is a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest for rhythm, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The concept of mending by embracing flawed history is deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in a distinct, poetic voice that modulates with emotional intensity ("doubt hissed like thawing steel"). The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through a locksmith's expertise and grief. The patterned elision of the prophecy's specifics is taught early and pays off in the focus on the lock itself. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats (e.g., "driftwood nostalgia: cedar shards from wrecked clocks, moon-dials scorched by eclipses") is mitigated because the list serves the accumulative, textural pattern and charges the closure image. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing, celestial mechanics, and a hall of mirrors is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transforms familiar tropes of grief and repair through grounded, inventive particulars. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
