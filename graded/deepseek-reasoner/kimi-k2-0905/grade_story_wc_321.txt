<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arden's resilient positivity is concretely embodied through actions like humming off-key and his refusal to admit the ferry is vanishing. His final choice to merge timelines arises from established motivation to anchor the ferry and find a dock that remembers him, with visible cost when the hourglass burns him. Interior contradiction shows in his refusal to surrender while acknowledging the ship's flickering state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change under a Hybrid lens (causal + accumulative): Arden's active merging of timelines solidifies the ferry and saves passengers, with cost felt through the hourglass's destruction. The grotto's closing and radio warnings create coherent pressure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and starlight actively constrain choices, forcing Arden to steer via phosphorescent patterns. Sensory details like "moon dripped like melting silver" and "barnacles traced interconnected patterns" are purposefully selective and filtered through Arden's professional perspective. The setting evolves causally with the timeline merge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Arden's agency under the Hybrid lens: his radio communication and steering maneuvers directly respond to mounting pressure from the closing grotto and flickering passengers. The cost is legible when the hourglass burns him and crumbles to dust. One meaningful tightening occurs as options narrow toward the decisive merge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hourglass's promise and Arden's choice to merge possibilities rather than select one. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to transience and choice through the image of "frost that chose to stay." No moralizing; subtext operates in the radio's layered heartbeats and the grotto's language of "salt and regret."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through Arden's perceptual signature ("clocks ran sideways," "wake spread in slow motion spirals"). Voice remains distinct under pressure, with rhythmic control in phrases like "hard port for two beats, steady for three." Experimental elements like the radio transmitting heartbeats are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language ("moon dripped like melting silver") is purposeful and consistent. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, with clear propulsion during the steering sequence. No loops or scaffold issues; closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a vanishing ferry and parallel timeline merge is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The hourglass mechanic feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and human complexity prioritize Arden's longing for home over surface novelty. Risk-taking in structure (temporal disorientation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
