<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and evolves from measurement to sensation exchange. Embodied emotion is strong, particularly with the urn fragment. Final renunciation of his former role is earned, though the trade feels slightly swift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant conceptual repricing (time as narrative exchange) with clear cost felt in the "texture shift inside his ribs." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald silo, price tags, and urn fragment are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the timekeeper's specific perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes evolve cleanly from personal discovery to communal exchange. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in building the cairn and engaging in trade. The cost of trading the fragment is legible and reweights the central concept.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of time as subjective narrative is masterfully integrated through concrete particulars (price tags, trades). The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of circulating narratives is a perfect conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent perceptual signature with controlled lyricism. POV is stable. Some minor register drift in phrases like "unabridged novel" slightly distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience at peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic and largely effective, though a tendency toward over-stacked metaphors ("fine metallic dust that settled on the tongue of the attentive") creates minor density artifacts in high-pressure beats, slightly obscuring immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original synthesis of concept and execution. The premise of numbers losing meaning is transformed through specific, grounded details and a unique communal response. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
