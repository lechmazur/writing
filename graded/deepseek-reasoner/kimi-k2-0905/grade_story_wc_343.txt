<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, embodied curiosity. Her micro-choices under pressure, like translating the spirals, reveal her hierarchy of values. The final choice is earned by prior causality, though the resolution's convenience slightly diminishes the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the ship reignites) with a resonant reconfiguration of Lira's status. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of light and language. The cost is legible in the prior dimming and the crew's isolation, resolved through Lira's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The airship setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, constraining movement and enabling discovery. The hopscotch board functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's cartographer POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative dimming of the lights, tightening the stakes coherently. Lira's agency in discovering and reading the patterns provides a meaningful turn that narrows options. The cost of failure is viscerally felt, though the resolution is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the intersection of language, light, and landscape. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared light and the newly charted passage. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's events and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled and consistent perceptual signature. The voice is highly specific to Lira's worldview, and the accumulative pattern is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating with the scene's needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of an antique airship, cartography, and light-as-language feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
