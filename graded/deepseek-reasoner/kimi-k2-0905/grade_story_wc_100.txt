<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undertaker's "inadvertently stubborn" nature is a consistent, embodied trait that motivates his initial refusal and final acceptance. His micro-choices, like pressing the shard into the bezel and folding the paper boats, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final choice to accept tenure is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his old life with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the undertaker accepts his role, foreclosing a path with clear cost. The structure is a seamless, causal journey from the package's arrival to the ocean floor, with each beat escalating pressure. The final image of his name appearing in the book is the exact on-page moment where cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not merely vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The brass octopus catalog, the shelves of swollen volumes, and the cracked dome all pressure the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through his professional POV, creating a fully integrated, tactile world that is indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a desperate, costly act of amplification. The dominant stake (revitalizing the signal) is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of the library and the failed initial repair. The cost of his final action—burning the pages of names—is unmistakable on the page and directly charges the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept, character, and image, resisting any direct statement. The core idea of giving rest a permanent address is answered non-literally by the final image of the lighthouse beam, reweighting the entire narrative. The piece elicits a profound emotional aftereffect through its particulars, not abstraction, embracing complex ambiguity about the nature of repose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, consistent perceptual signature and masterful rhythmic control, even under peak pressure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the undertaker's professional and melancholic worldview. The lyrical, compressed prose is a purposeful, pattern-taught choice that heightens the story's mythic quality without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and propulsion, with every sentence advancing multiple jobs. Figurative language is consistently inventive and coherent, enhancing rather than obscuring sense (e.g., "shelves of swollen volumes lined the boulevards, their spines aligned like processional candles"). There are zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; the language is pristine and purposeful throughout, including the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a rare, fully integrated synthesis of familiar elements (undertaker, lighthouse, sunken library) into a singular, inevitable, and breathtakingly original whole. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The risk-taking in its lyrical, accumulative design pays off magnificently, heightening stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
