<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "salt on his lips"). The undertaker's motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. His final acceptance feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost when he sees his name in the book. The trait "inadvertently stubborn" drives inevitable mistakes that compound before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the undertaker accepts tenure, redefining rest. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery and symbolic weight. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The final image reconfigures meaning without exposition, and cost is legible in the coral desk and tethered moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater library constrains choices (octopus catalog, lens guidance) and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("silt that had once been reading tables," "column of chased stillness"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves causally with events. The lens shard functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—folding pages into boats, burning them to amplify the signal. The dominant stake (giving rest an address) tightens through a meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is legible in his acceptance of permanence. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to rest and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "beacon that burns backward into the hearts"). The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("books breathing underwater," "bruised glimmers"). Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure, enhancing the dreamlike tone. Purposeful compression and lyrical deviations are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic variety, advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without mixed metaphors. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts. Sentences propel momentum ("Distress signals surged upward, a morse of moonlit bubbles"). Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker and lighthouse keeper roles is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The underwater library premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
