<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the tattoo stencil. The final choice to leave is earned by a decade of work and the lesson learned. The character's transformation from preservation to celebration is a decisive, motivated change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) as she chooses to return to the world, carrying her loss as material for new life. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through the ritual of placing each origami figure, culminating in a clear, cost-heavy final image. The observatory's rules are taught and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory itself is the primary "object-as-setting" and profoundly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the character's expertise and grief (e.g., "fabric woven from the unfinished dreams"). The setting is indispensable to the plot's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through the ritualistic act of placing each origami figure, a deepening that changes knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of grief. The cost of her decade of solitude and the final choice to leave are legible on the page, driven by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transformative grief is fully integrated and emerges organically from the core concept and character actions. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept of "genuinely artificial" is a profound thematic engine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by grief and craft. The lyrical, elevated diction is wholly consistent with the character's expertise and the story's tone. The prose is controlled and purposeful, even at peak emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, not ornamental ("curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial"). A single minor artifact: "subdued ardor" feels slightly telling, but it is immediately shown in the "precise folds," mitigating the deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, a timeless observatory, and origami coordinates is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through its implications. The story takes bold risks with its lyrical, accumulative structure that pay off in the powerful closure.</comment>
