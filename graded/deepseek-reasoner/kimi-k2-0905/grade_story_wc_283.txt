<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to offer the jar is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("feeling weight return—not of sand but of choice"). Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her tactile interaction with the buttons. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "felt quietly inspired," though it is quickly anchored in a concrete simile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held flawlessly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the canyon echo becomes "refined possibility," reweighting the prophecy with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the pattern of button classification escalates cleanly to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, its "resinous beams" and "unearthed silence" actively shaping the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional bias. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the button spiral serving as a tangible, constrained environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in classifying buttons, which deepens the stakes and culminates in a decisive cadence shift ("the shared wisdom rose not as revelation but as scent"). Cost is legible in the transformation of the echo and her renunciation of mere time-measurement. Pressure coheres and tightens through density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of buttons and echoes, resisting moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of prophecy through the image of a "garment we button together." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, particularly the "unearthed silence" that communicates simultaneous stories without syllables.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice that modulates under pressure ("every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed"). Diction remains within the character's lexicon; purposeful compression (e.g., "prophecy began to leak") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without mixed metaphors or artifice. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("dawn’s first blade slid between cliff and horizon, igniting amber walls into molten glass"). No loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of hourglasses, buttons, and echoes is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail (e.g., "jet beads from a mourning dress that absorbed a widow’s hiccupped sobs").</comment>
