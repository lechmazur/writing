<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's quiet deliberation is consistently embodied in micro-choices like tracing the key's rune and setting the rings backward. Her motivation to "relearn" anchors the drive, and the final sacrifice—trading her wandering shadow—is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("hearts suddenly heavier"). Interiority remains concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: shadows return globally, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, escalating through density increases (e.g., stars smearing into spoons) and a cadence shift at the spiral's center. Orientation is immediate; the automaton's activation and void revelation tighten options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory's orrery rings and automaton constrain choices (e.g., aligning the island, clicking the key) and charge the final image (mirrored chest guarding the loop). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's scholarly POV. The floating isle pressures tactics by enabling celestial replay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the Accumulative lens: winding the key backward, walking the twist's circumference. Cost is legible when shadows rush back into bodies worldwide, with "hearts suddenly heavier." The dominant stake (finding shadows) tightens through her actions, foreclosing her own shadow's freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (key, shadows, loops) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "every shadow is only love bent into shape by light." Subtext operates in implication (e.g., shadow waving goodbye). Minor deduction for near-statement in the final paragraph's "love bent" line, though it avoids full echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic perceptual signature ("stars outside smeared into silver spoons"). POV is stable and apt; compression (e.g., "moonshadows—an impossibility") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Lyra's scholarly lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language ("time creased like crumpled parchment") is purposeful and coherent. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "constellations poured like liquid"). No loops or scaffold; clarity persists through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and fully committed: spoons bending reality is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The synthesis of runes, automata, and shadows feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (e.g., Möbius band closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids quirkiness.</comment>
