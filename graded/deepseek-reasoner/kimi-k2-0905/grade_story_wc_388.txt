<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear, rooted in a credible shift from debunker to truth-seeker. Her internal conflict is embodied when she nearly drops the diamond, yearning for amnesia but persisting. The final choice to hang the diamond is earned by her established drive to "pull the teeth" of lies, with the cost of shame and copper taste felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; each step (Geiger counter, reassembling letters, humming the tone) logically narrows options toward the closure. The decisive change—hanging the diamond to broadcast lies—lands with a visible, conceptual cost as the apples brown and rot accelerates. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is not just backdrop; it actively constrains choice (e.g., the stillpoint's calm allows reassembly, radioactive dust threatens). The environment charges the final image as the apples brown. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Marisol's professional observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. comfortable lies) escalate through Marisol's agency: finding the stillpoint, reassembling letters, and enduring the diamond's playback. The cost is legible in the visceral reaction to the lies and the orchard's transformation. One meaningful tightening—from search to confrontation—forecloses her path to ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth and memory emerges organically through the diamond's curse and Marisol's actions, resisting moralizing. The final image of broadcasting lies to the soil offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the hex scars mirroring the archive's tessellation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marisol's sharp perception. Voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic prose that heightens pressure ("Each lie vibrated... until she tasted copper and shame"). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the Coalition's history) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but generally purposeful, with high information density. Minor overwriting in phrases like "angry cicada" slightly strains metaphor, but clarity and momentum are maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence rhythm supports tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The concept of a diamond that records lies is brilliantly original, synthesized with the wasteland setting and character arc. The choice to hang it as a bell transforms the premise. Risks in poetic density pay off, feeling inevitable in hindsight and heightening stakes.</comment>
