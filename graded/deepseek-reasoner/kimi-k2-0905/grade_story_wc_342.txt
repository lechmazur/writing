<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The artist's prosopagnosia is not a label but a filter that drives her unique perception and final, crucial choice to paint negative space. Her internal contradiction—inability to see faces yet ability to paint them—acts in scene, and her final renunciation (walking away) is earned by the causality of her discovery. The cost of the library's loss and her personal transformation is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held; closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing where her limitation is reweighted as a gift. The cost is legible in the final image of the painted sky outlasting the faces. The pattern of discovery (coin, note, painting) is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is indispensable, constraining her painting surface and charging the final image with its imminent destruction. The coin and brushes are micro-settings that shape her choices. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, reflecting her POV and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the live clock of the demolition, which tightens her choices and tactics on the page. The dominant stake (preserving memory) deepens into a personal revelation, and the cost of her effort and the library's loss is unmistakable. Agency is demonstrated through her calculated, frantic painting under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image: the central question of memory and perception is answered by the final, resonant image of the painted sky, a non-literal answer that reweights everything prior. The piece elicits a profound emotional aftereffect through concrete particulars, avoiding any moralizing or thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her condition. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with the rising pressure of the demolition. The prose's lyrical quality is voice-motivated, pattern-taught, and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in phrases like "fractally precise strokes" and "sky-shaped absence," which, while beautiful, edge toward decorative density in a high-pressure beat. However, these do not obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of concepts (face-blind artist, condemned library, coded coin) is organic, fresh, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The story commits fully to its vision, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance with clear, bold risk-taking.</comment>
