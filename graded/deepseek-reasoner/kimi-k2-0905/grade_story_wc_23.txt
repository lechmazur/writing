<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The navigator's patchwork nature is embodied in her specific, sensory components (compass hand, sextant eye), and her final choice to become the offering is earned by the causality of her actions and the moon's influence. Her motivation to navigate loss is concrete and drives every high-stakes choice, with micro-choices like soldering her hair revealing a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing, redefining the "geography of loss" as a country one can cross. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with each cryptic call and her obedient action intensifying the pattern until the final image reweights everything. The cost is legible on the page in the dissolution of her stitched form and the station's empty, flower-sprouting solidity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The frozen dish, the corroding censer foot, and the oil-stained concrete all directly constrain her choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and filtered through her specific, grief-shaped perception, making the environment a tactile extension of her interior state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by her agency in obeying the calls, each action a meaningful tightening that narrows her options toward the inevitable offering. The stakes—reversing loss—are immense and viscerally felt, with the cost of her dissolution paid on the page. The pressure coheres and deepens under the accumulative lens with each new instruction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of reverse migration as translation, culminating in the final, resonant image of her body becoming the geography for others. It is a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of grief, avoiding any moralizing. The reconfiguration is earned through the specific particulars of the censer foot, the moon, and her stitches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a perfect fusion of poetic precision and navigational jargon that never wavers. POV is stable and deeply embodied, with elision (the caller's identity) serving the thematic mystery. The prose is character, its rhythm and lexicon reflecting her stitched-together, technical, and grief-stricken nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet lucid, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates the mystical process. There is no scaffold or loop; every sentence advances the atmosphere and action. A single potential artifact—"like a final heartbeat"—is a minor, early cliché but is immediately overwhelmed by the originality that follows and does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a patchwork body, a mystical technical process, and the core concept of reverse migration is breathtakingly original and feels inevitable. The risk of a high-concept, lyrical mode pays off completely, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its singular vision and premise.</comment>
