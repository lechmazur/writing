<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("silk slippers soaked with dew," "lungs with threads of ice"). The final choice is earned by prior causality and carries immense cost (erasure of living memory). A slight deduction for the final realization ("Trembling, she realized...") feeling slightly more diagnostic than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) that reweights the entire premise, landing with undeniable cost ("its weight both coronation and erasure"). The orientation is clear and functional, and the time-loop structure is taught and paid off impeccably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The grotto, the starlight, and the basalt steps are not just described but are integral to the plot's mechanics and the protagonist's choices, creating a palpable, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is expertly driven by the queen's agency under the causal lens. The stakes transform from personal survival to a sacrificial, cosmic duty. The cost is viscerally felt on the page through the dripping starlight-memory and the final, irreversible act of coronation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory, sacrifice, cyclical time) emerges organically from the specific events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final image of the "hidden crown" burning and "remembering for everyone" achieves profound thematic resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature and exquisite rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The elision of the future self's direct speech is a taught, effective choice that pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly accomplished, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional moments of potential overwriting ("a paradox that felt like forgiveness wrapped inside betrayal") that, while beautiful, slightly risk clarity in high-pressure beats. No loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a time-loop prophecy with a cosmic memory leak is original, ingenious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world-building, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
