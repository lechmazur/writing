<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice to weave the echoes. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("words tasting of iron curtain weights"). The final transformation is earned by prior causality, with the cost of Lila's departure felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable cost—Lila's departure and the thimble left behind. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through layered sensory details that culminate in the final, solidified applause. The orchard's existence, dependent on memory, is a persistent constraint that shapes the entire tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The mystic orchard garden and the stage within it are the crucible for the ghost's transformation. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, reflecting the ghost's synesthetic perception (e.g., "perfume that sounded... like distant violins").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency under the Accumulative lens, using the coin and thread to actively weave the echoes. The cost is unmistakable and legible in the moment Lila vanishes, leaving only her thimble. The dominant stake (possibility vs. despair) tightens meaningfully through this action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory and performance emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: the endless encore carried within. The final image of the "hidden wing of the theater" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, offering a profound conceptual repricing of despair and possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, synesthetically-driven perceptual signature ("citrine applause, indigo silence"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. There is no head-hopping; the single focalizer's consciousness is consistently rendered with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent, taught, and coherent, serving the accumulative design without muddle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts to obscure the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, a synesthetic coin, and a memory-dependent orchard feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry, fully committing to its singular artistic vision.</comment>
