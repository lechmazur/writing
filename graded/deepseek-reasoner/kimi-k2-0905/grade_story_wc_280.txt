<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear, rooted in a tangible need to preserve memory through applause. His micro-choices, like pressing the coin and walking the stage, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final transformation into the young actor is earned by his active weaving of echoes, with a visible cost in the orchard's enduring but dimmed state. Lila's presence, though a memory, applies immediate pressure that alters his tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the ghost's physical transformation) and a resonant reconfiguration (the orchard waiting as a hidden wing), both landing on-page with cost. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, building through layered sensory echoes that intensify and reweight the stake. The pattern is taught early and pays off cleanly. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The theater, maze, and orchard are tactile and pressure the ghost's actions. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through his synesthetic perception (e.g., "citrine applause," "perfume that sounded like distant violins"). Spatial choreography is coherent and evolves with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency under the accumulative lens, weaving echoes to thicken nostalgia into "almost-solid ground." The cost is legible in his transformation and the orchard's conditional existence. The dominant stake (memory/preservation) is signaled early and tightens through his actions, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action, exploring memory, art, and time without direct statement. The final image of the orchard waiting offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of enduring possibility. Subtext operates in implication, such as Lila's advice to "lure it from the brink of despair."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia. The voice is consistently poetic and rhythmically controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "minutes fracture into colored ribbons") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor risk of overwriting in a few phrases, but clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost, theater, synesthesia, and fractured time is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical density and temporal play heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept commits fully to its implications, avoiding template plots or derivative premises.</comment>
