<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's phobia and stunt double history are embodied through specific micro-choices (trembling flashlight, knocking knees) that intensify under pressure. His final choice to "leak the uncut reel" is a decisive change earned by the shell's message and his prior struggle, foreclosing his old identity with the visible cost of facing studio security. The girl applies immediate, relevant pressure, and Leo's internal contradiction (flinching at shadows yet leaping off buildings) acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: the DNA test compels the library search, which leads to the girl and the decrypted message, which directs him to the shell, whose message reconfigures his tactics against the guards. Closure is a decisive change (embracing vulnerability as power) with cost legible in the final image of his "heart still quaking but stride firmly adaptive." Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rusted library is a pressure cooker that constrains movement and choice, while the seashell charges the final image and reconfigures meaning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iron shelves listing," "starlight leaking through a hole"), filtered through Leo's professional lens ("industry speak for the edited lie"). The shell itself functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving he is more than expendable muscle) is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful tightening: the guards' arrival forces a peak choice where agency (projecting the raw footage) is driven by the shell's instruction and forecloses a path with on-page cost (their disgusted hesitation). The cost is visible in their reaction and his subsequent escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power) emerges organically from the shell's message and the final act of projection, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The seashell and the raw footage are recurring images that shift meaning and charge the closure. Subtext operates powerfully in the girl's dialogue and the shell's whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by his profession ("stunt beats," "camera-smoke"). Prose rhythm is controlled under pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact content of the DNA test) is paid off. The girl's dialogue carries subtext ("Only to people who listen scared").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("rusted library groaned like an old prop ship"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure. The final line's rhythm and image ("lights that would never again drown the shake") are masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Hollywood artifice and personal authenticity is fresh and inevitable. The core premise (stunt double as director's son) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric, cinematic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels earned and singular.</comment>
