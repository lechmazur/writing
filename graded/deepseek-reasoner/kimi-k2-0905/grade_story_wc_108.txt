<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's characterization is deeply specific with embodied contradictions—phobia-ridden yet professional—driving micro-choices under pressure. His motivation intensifies cleanly from the DNA revelation to the shell's message, culminating in an earned stance change. The girl applies immediate pressure but remains secondary; her cryptic role supports without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: each beat narrows options (test → library → cast clue → shell → projector confrontation). Closure is a decisive change (leaking the reel) with visible cost (security pursuit, emotional rupture). Orientation is immediate; the library's role as both setting and catalyst charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (shelves as obstacles, alcove as hiding spot) and charges the climax (projector use, starlight). Sensory details are selective and urgency-filtered (e.g., "iron shelves listing," "starlight leaking through a hole"). Spatial choreography remains clear despite atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: each discovery (cast clue, shell message) deepens the conflict and narrows options. The cost is legible when Leo chooses to project his fear rather than flee, altering tactics under guard pressure. The dominant stake (proving vulnerability's power) tightens meaningfully to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell's message and Leo's final act, rejecting moralizing for earned resonance. The core concept (transformative betrayal) integrates via specific events (tyrant's editing, Leo's reclamation). Subtext operates in gesture and image (e.g., "knees knock" yet "stride firmly adaptive").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with voice modulating under stress ("trembling certainty"). Diction remains character-bound (industry terms like "betray the frame"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the girl's lines carry subtext without exposition. Elision (e.g., the shell's exact message) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density ("rusted library under the stars groaned like an old prop ship"). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. No loops or artifacts; sentences vary rhythm to match tension peaks (e.g., short bursts during guard arrival). Closure image is crisp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of stunt double phobia, cinematic metaphor, and emotional vulnerability feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specificity (e.g., "decrypting smudged notes" as professional skill). Risk-taking in structure (single scene with layered reveals) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
