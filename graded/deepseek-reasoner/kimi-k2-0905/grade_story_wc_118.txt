<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The historian's interiority is concrete and particular, with micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final choice—trading solitude to become the displaced axis—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The emotional progression is realistic, layering contradiction through embodied perception rather than diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost on the page. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting the stake. The final image of the historian stepping into the dark, carried by the story, reconfigures meaning with felt pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the historian's professional bias. The silo library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. However, some descriptions, like "cooled ember and graphite," are evocative but do not directly pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with each diary find deepening knowledge and narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final renunciation of solitude. The "displaced axis" concept shapes stakes but is more thematic than tactical, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of stories and memory through the final image of the historian becoming the axis. No moralizing or thematic echo in the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. The voice is consistent and character-specific, with no head-hopping. Diction and syntax reflect the historian's mind and state throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Read-aloud ear test is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic archival work, transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in structure and perspective heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
