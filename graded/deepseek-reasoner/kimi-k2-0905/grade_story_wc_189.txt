<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The chronicler's "warmly observant" trait constrains her approach to reconciliation, and her final choice to offer the cicada is earned by prior causality. The daughter's emotional progression is realistic, with contradictory impulses visible in her "laugh that was half sob." The final renunciation and reweaving feel earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with palpable cost, crystallizing the renegotiation of their relationship. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through sensory density and cadence shifts. The final image of the "transition period made visible" reconfigures the stakes. The persistent constraint of time's texture shapes the entire narrative and the final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting is indispensable, functioning as a crucible that pressures choices and charges the final image. Its "limestone ribs" and the tidal pool actively constrain the characters' movements and shape the reconciliation. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's professional bias. The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, as seen in the "brittle star" serving as a "living diagram."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, building through the density of observed details and the cadence of the tide. The cost of their estrangement and the effort of reconciliation is legible in the daughter's "half sob" and the "awkward jokes" foreseen. The dominant stake of reconciliation is signaled early and meaningfully deepens through their shared silence and observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of the jade cicada motif, the tidal metaphors, and the central conflict. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of reconciliation through the final image of the "transition period." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, such as the offering of the cicada. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through its particulars, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature—the "tangential" and "tidal" way of noticing. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. The few lines of dialogue are natural and carry significant subtext. The voice modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence or specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences that advance multiple jobs. There is a slight tendency toward density in high-pressure beats, with figurative language appearing in most sentences (e.g., "grotto felt like a throat between worlds"). However, the pattern is taught and pays off, and clarity is never obscured. The final paragraph's propulsion is exceptional, accelerating the thematic resolution without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tidal-pool chronicler's profession, the jade cicada motif, and the theme of transition periods feels fresh, specific, and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through grounded, character-specific choices rather than remaining abstract. The emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, feeling authentically lived-in. The risky, quiet ending heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
