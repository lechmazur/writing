<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with the chronicler's observational nature driving micro-choices like shifting the lantern light. The daughter's hesitant arrival and acceptance of the cicada feel earned. A minor deduction for the daughter's initial motivation remaining slightly oblique, though her drawn-by-the-tide explanation mitigates this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through the shared silence and exchanged cicada, with cost legible in their tentative, wordless connection. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly. The daughter's arrival, while thematically fitting, introduces a minor situational convenience that slightly softens the otherwise impeccable causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The "limestone ribs," "starlit basin," and "grit of salt" are not just descriptive but are integral to the characters' actions and the story's thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative pressure, masterfully using the grotto's atmosphere and the cicada's symbolism to deepen the emotional stakes. The cost of their estrangement and the tentative hope of reconciliation are palpable throughout, culminating in the powerful, non-verbal resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image (cicada, tidal pool), action (observation, offering), and character. The final realization that "every pause is a cocoon" is a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of reconciliation and time, earned entirely through the preceding particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct—lyrical, precise, and perfectly aligned with the chronicler's profession and psyche. The prose rhythm modulates with the emotional pressure, and the sparing dialogue carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of proximate metaphor ("folded like a tiny green heart," "pulse with the same rhythm") but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure clarity. The prose is otherwise flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tidal-pool chronicler's profession, the jade cicada motif, and the thematic exploration of time is original, ingenious, and feels inevitable. The story takes lyrical risks that heighten its stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
