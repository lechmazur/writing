<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his "persistent curiosity," compelling his high-stakes choice to engage with the dead. His internal conflict is shown in scene ("He wasn’t a hero...") and his final stance shift from chasing to being led is earned. A minor deduction for the child's identity reveal feeling slightly abrupt, though the cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through increasing sensory density and the voice's insistence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias's role is redefined. The closure lands with cost ("For when you forget") and the lens holds. The final image reconfigures his purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("scent of damp stone and something older"). The environment actively pressures the protagonist and evolves with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, as he actively adjusts the hearing aid and engages with the voice, leading to a decisive tightening. The cost is legible in the final reconfiguration of his purpose. A minor deduction as the final turn relies slightly on a revealed fact (the child's identity) rather than a pure choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of voice, image, and action, exploring memory, witnessing, and the cost of listening. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged image of the photograph and the redefined purpose, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's texture is exceptional ("like pennies left on a corpse’s eyes"). Purposeful elision (the child's identity) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Rhythm is masterfully controlled to modulate with pressure. A single instance of slightly elevated diction ("fracturing twilight") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a contact tracer for hearts and a supernatural hearing aid is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity. Risk-taking in the lyric, atmospheric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
