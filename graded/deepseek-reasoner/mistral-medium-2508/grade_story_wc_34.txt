<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional with concrete interiority shown through embodied actions like tracing the bolt plate. The balladeer's motivation ("to articulate unspoken needs") is dramatized through his grandmother's legacy and his final choice to refuse the ghost, which carries visible cost ("throat raw with words he’d never sing"). Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—curiosity versus self-preservation—and the renunciation feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the balladeer's refusal forecloses assimilation with visible cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words (who, where, when). The pattern of encoding and response escalates coherently, and the final image of the child reaching for the wall reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost about cyclical responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the misty courtyard and flower press bolt plate actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("slick with the ghost of rain," "scent of ozone and old parchment"). The bolt plate evolves from relic to tool to sacrifice, and the environment's inversion during the climax is causally integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increases: the ghost's need becomes a physical pressure, and the balladeer's encoding intensifies to a spiral question. His final agency (the "rest" symbol) forecloses assimilation with felt cost. The dominant stake (articulating need versus containing hunger) tightens meaningfully through patterned repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of flower pressing and code encoding, exploring the burden and ethics of translating silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the child's implied cycle, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the bolt plate's cooling and the valley's cleaned slate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with a lyrical, perceptually biased texture ("air hung thick as wet silk"). POV stability is maintained, and elision (e.g., the ghost's nature) is purposeful and paid off. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in phrases like "bright and terrible," which minimally strains POV plausibility under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-linked (e.g., "silent poetry" to "chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. One minor mixed metaphor ("wet silk between lightning and thunder") is quickly offset by strong propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: the synthesis of balladeer, ghost-in-code, and flower press mechanics feels inevitable and fresh. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. Risk-taking in hybrid genre and structure heightens meaning without gimmickry, and the closure image is wholly singular.</comment>
