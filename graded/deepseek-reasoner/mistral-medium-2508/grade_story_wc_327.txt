<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling, inherited hunger. The copper veins and flawed diamond provide concrete, character-particular embodiment. A minor deduction for the peak choice ("translate it all") feeling slightly more declared than fully dramatized as an internal contradiction in the moment, though the cost is devastatingly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held flawlessly. Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the cost is legible on the page ("The diamond cracked," "Veyra is part of the echo now"), and the final image reweights the entire premise of translation. The structure is airtight, with every beat accumulating pressure toward the inevitable, devastating end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's crucible. The canyon, bone towers, and flawed diamond are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Veyra's specific expertise, creating a world that feels both immense and intimately tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Veyra's agency under the Accumulative lens. The stake—capturing a dying language—is signaled immediately and tightens with terrifying inevitability as the echoes twist and become alive. The cost is unmistakable and devastating, paid in full on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of the perils of translation and the cost of absolute knowledge is fully integrated, emerging from the specific action of harnessing the echo. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the entire endeavor with a devastating and resonant cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly matched to the Accumulative/Textural mode. The perceptual signature is unique ("the grit of consonants," "the silk of vowels"). A minor deduction for a few complex sentences that, while beautiful, momentarily slow the high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. The read-aloud test is passed with flying colors. A hairline deduction for very minor overwriting in a single peak-beat metaphor ("the sound of a blade dragged across old wounds") which slightly strains coherence under extreme pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cursed translator, a language of bird flight, and bone towers is breathtakingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its high-concept premise, executing it with singular vision and emotional truth. A rare and memorable piece.</comment>
