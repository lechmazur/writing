<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied and contradictory, as seen in "bleak exhilaration." Micro-choices, like keying the frequency, reveal her values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the final image reweights "potential" from something to hunt to something to feel the weight of. Cost is legible in "the geode cold again in her hand." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory constrains choice through its isolation and equipment. The geode charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like "steel ribs groaning." The setting evolves with the plot, pressuring Lena's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the causal lens, keying the frequency. The cost is unmistakable in the observatory's shudder and alarms. The dominant stake (finding potential) tightens through her choice, forcing a trade-off with the field's stability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the theme of potential through the final image of the geode going cold. Theme emerges from events, not statement, and subtext operates in implication, like the geode as a "map of something she couldn’t name."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "intangibly tangible." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly precise with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, e.g., "perturbation theory wasn’t just math—it was a knife." Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi and emotional trauma feels organic and inevitable. The geode and perturbation theory are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
