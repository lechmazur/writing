<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headed endurance is embodied through tactile, professional gestures (tracing grooves, voicing silence) and a micro-choice hierarchy that prioritizes protective silence over desperate reclamation. His final renunciation—letting the false echo go—is earned by thirty years of disciplined listening, with cost legible in the blackened stems and the cold rail spike. A hairline deduction for slightly over-tidy emotional calibration in the memory flashback, though the contradiction between professional control and paternal grief remains potent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through pattern breaks (sleepwalking stars, restless garden) and a decisive cadence shift (digging toward silent soil) that forces a stance crystallization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the fisher's endurance silences the false echo, reconfiguring his relationship to loss with cost felt in the garden's blackened stems and the spike's cold burn. The final image of mending nets under a star-swallowing dark perfectly captures the poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable, constraining choice by translating emotion into tangible frequency and providing the resource (silent soil) that directs the climactic dig. The rail spike evolves from a forged hook to a digging tool to a vessel for captured echo, charging the final image with its cold presence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—subsonic pulses, vibration in teeth, smell of river reeds—filtered through the fisher's professional expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a coherent density increase: the garden's restlessness tightens into a specific threat (something wearing his daughter's voice), forcing the fisher to use his method (voicing silence) not as inquiry but as command. The cost is legible in the garden's scream and blackened stems, a price paid to reseal the sky. His agency—endurance and renunciation—narrows options by rejecting the false echo, foreclosing the path of desperate reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox of carrying silence: the fisher's endurance becomes a form of love that refuses to be corrupted by false echoes. The final image of mending nets in a star-swallowing dark offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief—not closure, but a charged poise between maintenance and dissolution. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures (not turning, blowing out the lantern) and the recurring mouth imagery that conceptualizes loss as something that consumes and echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by professional expertise (reading frequencies, voicing silence). Syntax modulates under pressure, compressing during the dig ("The rail spike struck something hollow") and expanding in lyrical moments ("the kind of dark that didn’t reflect stars—only swallowed them"). Purposeful elision (the goddess's nature) is taught early and pays off in the terrifying mouth revelation. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density (e.g., "lined with teeth made of broken echoes"). Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though one minor mixed metaphor ("the sky bled frequencies") slightly muddles the otherwise coherent sensory logic. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating during the dig and pausing for resonant images. No scaffolding, loops, or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of mythic and emotional realms, transforming the trope of grieving parent into a cosmological struggle against false echoes. The core concept (sleepwalking constellations unravelling meaning) is fully committed to and integrated with the personal stake. Risk-taking in the grotesque mouth imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the final charged poise feels both inevitable and freshly conceived.</comment>
