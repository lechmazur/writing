<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. Her quiet deliberation is embodied in specific actions like tracing cold metal, and her final choice to step through the light feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her calm acceptance of danger, revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost—the hunger of the dark is felt. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density increase and cadence shift reweighting the stake. The automaton's warning about the first scholar provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory and automaton key function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's expertise. The floating isle's tilt and the library of sealed doors evolve causally with events, reinforcing the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful tightening when she turns the second key. Cost is legible in the automaton's warning and the key turning to ash. The dominant stake (finding the shadows) is tested and reweighted with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of "relearn[ing] the shape of hunger." Theme emerges from events and motifs like keys and loops, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration of "closing" to "opening" loops charges the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure ("stars pulsed like embers"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and voice-modulated, with dialogue carrying subtext and advancing plot. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Syntax varies purposefully to support rhythm and emphasis. Read-aloud ear test passes with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar tropes (keys, automata) through specific grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise commits fully to its implications, with turns feeling earned in hindsight.</comment>
