<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lior's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The sister's backstory fragment is anchored in the present and alters his stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable conceptual cost on-page. The final image of burying the eye reweights prior material. Orientation is clear within 120 words; pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices and charges the final image. The orchard and ravine pressure tactics, while sensory details are selective and purposeful. The glass eye functions as micro-setting, evolving in use and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens; pressure coheres through density increase. The dominant stake (psychological safety) tightens meaningfully, with visible cost in the truffle-eating beat and final renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to truth vs. kindness. Subtext operates powerfully in occlusion and the final burial. No moralizing; complexity embraces meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and apt; voice modulates with emotional intensity. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional. Minor overwriting in "broken chandelier" metaphor slightly strains coherence, but no loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through specific grounded choices. Premise commits fully to implications; emotional truth and human complexity elevate beyond surface novelty. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
