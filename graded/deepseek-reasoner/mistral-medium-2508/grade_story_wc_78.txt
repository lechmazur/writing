<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his values. His final laugh and raised mallet show earned stance crystallization with visible thrill rather than fear. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on poetic description in peak beats, but it remains character-consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost felt in the "thrill of the next note" and the world leaning in. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts escalating to the sea's voice. No orientation debt; all anchors are established early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tilting guides strikes) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Leeward's perception. The environment is inextricable from the action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leeward's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each strike intensifying the sky's response until the sea's voice swells. Cost is legible in his caught breath and trembling mallet, foreclosing his prior solitary practice for collaborative play.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of obstacle into instrument, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates through cloud patterns and the sea's hum, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with taught elision (e.g., "fractals within fractals") paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focused on Leeward's experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid but has minor density issues in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractal tendrils" and "geometric precision" in close succession). However, clarity remains, and propulsion is strong with varied syntax. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of music, weather, and seascape into a singular vision. The core concept of "dubbing" the storm is transformative and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
