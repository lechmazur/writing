<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("steeped the memory of him... until the bitterness became part of her"). The final choice to walk away is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with visible cost, rooted in prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. A hairline deduction for a single moment of near-diagnostic language ("proximate causes were her method").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist walks away, the covenant "breathing," reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost felt in the final image. Causality is tight, with orientation anchored immediately. The persistent constraint of loss shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image ("its cracks filled with the stubborn green"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and personal priorities. The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of preservation. The protagonist's agency in the act of tracing the photo and then walking away forces a stance crystallization with a visible, felt cost. Pressure coheres and grows until the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory as an act of preservation emerges wholly from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the "breathing" covenant. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, resisting tidy morals and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and apt, with a consistent, character-specific voice. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and syntax that reflects the mind of the archivist. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates with scene needs. There is a single, minor instance of potential overwriting ("haunted by what could have been") but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure beat. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory, loss, and ritual. The combination of archivist, walnut ink, and regenerated covenant feels organic and indispensable. The perspective is memorable and specific, with bold risk-taking in its lyric mode that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
