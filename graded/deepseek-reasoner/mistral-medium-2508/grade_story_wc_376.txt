<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his physical aversion to dishonesty, compelling his high-stakes journey. His internal conflict is embodied through trembling hands and stiffening joints, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to write without gilding is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the altered zinc plate and lighter breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias chooses to write honestly, reweighting his life's work. Cost is legible in the smoothed zinc plate and his lighter breath. The map's discovery feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The toxic sky and greenhouse domes pressure choices, constraining Elias's world. The zinc plate and archive environment charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like "air smelled of damp earth and something older." Micro-setting (desk, chute) is integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-telling) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens through Elias's journey and writing choice. Cost is felt in the plate's transformation and his altered breathing. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of candor emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's writing and the smoothed plate. Subtext operates in implication, like the archive's whispers. Resists tidy morals, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "sky choked with copper haze." Diction and syntax reflect Elias's calligrapher mindset. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific. Purposeful compression supports the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, like "truths were seeds." Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the archive. No loops or scaffold. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of calligrapher, toxic world, and archive of whispers feels inevitable. Specific, grounded choices transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final image recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
