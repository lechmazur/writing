<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the final sacrifice where vibrations "unravel her from the inside out." The final choice is a credible endurance of immense cost, earned by her established competence and the monks' backstory. The trait "logically emotional" is dramatized in her steady hands slotted against the internal debate between logic and emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost: her body is rewriting itself into "something less human." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and the escalating hum of the sphere. The key's late introduction is a minor flaw, but its use is causally integrated and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is indispensable, acting as a natural dampener and then a conduit, directly constraining the climax. The sphere and resonator are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through her professional expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the thinning ice and the sphere's escalating whine. Protagonist agency drives the final, costly turn. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful tightening—the turning of the key—that forecloses all other paths with a severe, on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image, particularly the redefinition of "sonic absolution" from erasure to matching. The final image of her laughing, a "perfect" sound answered by the marina, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of sacrifice and adaptation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature attuned to vibration and sound. The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, modulating under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and all elision feels motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists ("fleshly ethereal" could be seen as slightly contradictory), but it does not harm clarity or momentum. The closure beat is executed with masterful clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic theology, and a frozen setting is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "vibrational matching" is a fresh, non-obvious inflection on sacrifice. The story commits fully to its premise, and the risk-taking with its lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
