<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her gloved hands trembling"). The final choice to write the letter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the library's dissolution. Minor deduction for a single instance of telling over showing ("her heart no longer a cipher, but a door").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid drive lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds. Closure is a decisive change from seeking unspoken words to actively speaking them, with cost legible in the library's collapse and the watch's final stillness. The time constraint ("before the second letter’s arrival") creates coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library is not just a vivid setting but a crucible that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The mist and the watch's mechanics are integrated into the action and perception, shaping tactics and escalating stakes with high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the hybrid lens, with the ticking clock and dissolving library creating palpable pressure. The cost is unmistakable as the library collapses, forcing a sprint to the door and a final, costly renunciation of the watch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken words versus active communication emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final realization ("it was about learning to say it") is earned through the protagonist's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (the watch's exact mechanics) that pays off. Minor deduction for occasional over-written density in high-pressure beats ("each tick a propagation delay unraveling time").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and generally clear propulsion, though some figurative language in peak beats approaches density without full pattern-teaching ("its hands moving in cyclically reversed arcs"). No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a magical library and a time-bending watch that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes, with clear risk-taking that heightens meaning.</comment>
