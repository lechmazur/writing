<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Liora's quiet drive and artistic sensibility are consistently embodied through concrete actions (stained fingers, pressing palm to glass). Her final renunciation of painting for listening is earned by the causal progression of discovery. The embodied micro-choices under pressure, like her breath fogging the pane, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with undeniable cost: "She had spent a lifetime chasing the dawn, only to realize it was the hush before it that held the truth." Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The pavilion, window, and garden are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The cathedral window is the crucible of the revelation. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully filtered through Liora's POV, evolving with the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and deepening that reweights the dominant stake from curiosity to understanding. The pressure to know intensifies through the postcards and the window's reaction, culminating in Liora's agency to stop painting and listen, foreclosing her previous path with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from image and event, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer: "Some things only reveal themselves when you stop looking." The final conceptual repricing—from seeking to listening—is earned through the entire narrative's particulars, avoiding any moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and texture. The lyrical, compressed prose is perfectly voice-motivated and pattern-taught, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a potential figurative density in the final third (e.g., "thick and sweet, like a secret kept too long"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of artist, mystical pavilion, and silent revelation feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The specific, grounded choice to make the revelation about listening rather than seeing is a non-obvious and ingenious inflection that transforms a familiar trope. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure fully coheres.</comment>
