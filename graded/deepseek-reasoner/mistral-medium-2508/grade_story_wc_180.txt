<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion and a micro-choice (digging, planting) that reveals a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of duty for genuine persistence is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the ribbon biting the wrist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through recurring images (ribbon, vows, seed) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost in the final question and the act of eating the apple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice (digging in the loam) and charging the final image (light through the rose window). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into the character's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the discovery of the box and note serving as a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is legible in the mender's trembling fingers and the final, tart bite of the apple.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of generational wisdom and deciduous vows emerges organically from concrete particulars, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the doll cradling the sprout offers profound thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (the exact nature of the contract) is taught and paid off, contributing to the story's lyricism and mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, accelerating rhythm in step with scene needs without ever obscuring clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cathedral-orchard, quartz-eye mender, and deciduous vows is wholly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
