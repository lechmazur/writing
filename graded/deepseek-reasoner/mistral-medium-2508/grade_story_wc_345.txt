<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in a desire for respite, intensifying to compel her to orchestrate a collective effort. Her internal conflict is shown through hesitation ("Why me?") and her final choice to stay is earned. Kael is a fully realized secondary character whose altruism and "you're early" motif apply consistent pressure. A minor deduction for Kael's backstory ("though he never said how") remaining slightly vague, but it does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through the density of arrivals and collective work. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the built nebula becomes a state of being, landing on the page with cost ("the universe breathed back"). The orientation is immediate and the pattern of collective effort is taught and paid off. The final image reconfigures the premise of respite with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and actively pressures choices—the cracked earth must be listened to, the arches hum, and the bell's sound unfolds. The environment constrains and enables tactics, most notably charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's perception ("fruit pulsed with starlight"). The orchard planet is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from individual listening to collective building. The dominant stake (creating respite) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the bell's ring and the arrival of others. The cost is legible in the final, collective effort and the ghost's solidification. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient and effectively executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of building respite emerges organically from events and images, culminating in the potent, non-literal reconfiguration: "Not a place to escape to, but a place to build." Subtext operates in gesture and implication (Kael's smile, the warm bell). The final message, "We stay," offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the entire concept of the nebula.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, poetic rhythm ("unfolded, like a bloom in reverse"). POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong, with Liora's worldview coloring the description. The ghost's dialogue carries a distinct, vow-like weight. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, concrete imagery. The prose is concise and propulsive, with rhythmic variation. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "Ripe enough to split the sky" is a slightly strained metaphor, but it is an isolated case and does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost, a galactic concept, and a collective effort feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world-building. The final reconfiguration of the "nebula of respite" is a non-obvious, ingenious twist that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
