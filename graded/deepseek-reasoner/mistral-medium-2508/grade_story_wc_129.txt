<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reed's motivation is clear and intensifies believably from carving to organizing the search. Her bold sympathy is embodied in micro-choices like tracing the warm paint. The final renunciation of chasing Syl shows earned endurance with visible cost in the ache of recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lost languages become an invitation, reweighting meaning with undeniable cost felt in the final paragraph. The search structure coheres and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The obsidian arbor's tactile sharpness and the crater's humming mist pressure Reed's decisions and shape the closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Reed's agency under the accumulative lens. Her decision to organize the search tightens the stake of belonging, and the cost is legible in the final ache of recognition. The pressure coheres through to the charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of kinship as a current, not a place, emerges wholly from events and the final image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the lost languages from ending to invitation without moralizing. Exceptional integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control. The prose's lyricism is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, paid off at closure. POV is stable and filters the world through Reed's sculptor sensibility. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "the ache of recognition," but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of kinship, art, and loss. The combination of sculptor and street artist feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Highly original vision.</comment>
