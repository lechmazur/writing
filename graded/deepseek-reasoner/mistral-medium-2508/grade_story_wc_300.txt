<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inspector's motivation evolves from professional duty to transcendent purpose through concrete micro-choices like trembling fingers and deliberate digging. Her final stance—"learning how to shine"—is earned through embodied integration of others' confessions, with visible cost in her relinquishment of radio communication and former identity. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing ("heart was full of names") at peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: shell discoveries intensify rhythmically toward climax where pearl's absorption reconfigures reality. Closure is decisive change (dissolving walls) with felt cost—her former mission abandoned, now carrier of communal hope. Orientation is immediate and taught; causality flows through confessional fragments accumulating pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Caves function as active crucible—bioluminescent crystals feed on confessions, pulsing walls mirror emotional intensity. Pearl and shells constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (shattered quartz, electric air, resonant hush), deeply integrated with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding a weapon to birthing radiance through protagonist's agency—each shell excavated deepens her commitment. Cost is legible in her abandonment of duty and physical transformation. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens: density of confessions narrows options until absorption becomes inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shells' confessions and the pearl's transformation—walls between hearts are dissolved through shared vulnerability. Final image (scattering confessions like seeds) offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in etched phrases and the inspector's silent actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied with distinct perceptual signature ("veins of bioluminescent crystal that throbbed"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("purpose that wasn't entirely hers"), though rhythm remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong read-aloud quality ("crunched over shattered quartz"). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. One minor loop: "full of shells"/"full of names" slightly echoes, but doesn't obscure closure. Information density high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of bunker exploration and mystical transformation. Pearl-as-method subverts weapon tropes; confessional shells create fresh mechanics for emotional revelation. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off with undeniable conceptual integrity and emotional specificity.</comment>
