<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lior's motivation is sharp and consistent, embodied in his specific, tactile actions. His "esoteric realist" nature is shown, not told, through his cataloging of wind and building of fragile structures. A minor deduction for a single moment of abstract phrasing ("the need to honor what the world forgot") that briefly summarizes his drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lior accepts the structure's dissolution, reconfiguring the meaning of remembrance. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the unraveling spiral and his decision to begin again.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively pressures the narrative. It swallows sound, offers glimpses of the valley, and its wind physically dismantles Lior's work. The environment is inseparable from the central conflict and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lior's agency under the accumulative lens—his act of building the spiral is a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake of remembrance. The cost is the structure's inevitable dissolution, which is felt and directly shapes his final, enduring stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from concrete action and image, resisting moralizing. The final paragraphs offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor transience. The concept of "interrupted cadences" is fully integrated and paid off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical, precise rhythm is perfectly controlled and modulates with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the voice is singular and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent. A single, hairline instance of potential register elevation ("reproach") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a man building fragile signals to honor a lost migration is profoundly original and feels inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and world create a singular artistic stance. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
