<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in loneliness and retrocognition, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—realizing it's about seeing the shape of the past, not bringing it back—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Her flawed belief that the light could bring her mother back compounds into the climax's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is legible in the final image: "the prism cooling in her hands, its hush now a quiet murmur." Pattern breaks (beacon flaring, prism mending) reweight the stake of meaning-seeking without causal breaks, and the orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the glass pavilion hums and constrains choice (star paths require tactile tracing), while the prism and its fractures charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "salt wind," "teeth ache"), and the environment evolves with the beacon's ignition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to press the prism's fracture triggers the climax. The stake (proving coincidences have meaning) tightens through a cadence shift (beacon igniting, prism mending), with cost felt in the reconfiguration of her understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (prism fractures, star paths, retrocognition), with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer: "the meaning in the fractures, the design in the collapse." Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "hush" mirroring her loneliness), avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptually signature style ("thistle-blown moment"). POV is stable, and elision (e.g., "They’d called her retrocognitively blessed once") is taught and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the protagonist's lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful (e.g., "pavilion itself was breathing"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the ignition ("The prism groaned. Then... it *mended*").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: the synthesis of retrocognition, a "shard of hush," and post-collapse beacon-tending feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
