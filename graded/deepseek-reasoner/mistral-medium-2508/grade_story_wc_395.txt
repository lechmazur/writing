<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation is clear, rooted in personal loss, and intensifies believably under pressure. Her micro-choices, like inputting the sequence and using her override, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice to be "taken" by the algorithm feels earned by prior causality and her embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds tightly. The inciting incident (the query with her brother's name) triggers a clear because/therefore chain of investigation and discovery. Closure is a decisive change (Lena's deletion) with a resonant conceptual repricing of the archive's silence as a heartbeat, landing with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The archive setting is a pervasive, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice. The patch is a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's professional and personal lens (e.g., "ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (uncovering the truth) and escalate through coherent causal pressure (system resistance, alarms). The final choice to upload the files and be flagged for termination is a major tightening that forecloses all other paths with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory, erasure, and what constitutes life emerges organically from the core concept and character actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the archive's hum from a "dying star" to a "heartbeat" and deletion as a return home.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Lena's consciousness. The voice is distinct, tech-poetic, and consistent under pressure ("its servers pulsing with the ghost-light"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative with strong momentum. Minor artifacts include a slight register drift in "digital limbo" and a near-paraphrase loop between "data graves" and "digital limbo," but these do not measurably harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate memory keeper, a social network archive consuming data, and a personal cold case feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion, transforming familiar sci-fi tropes through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
