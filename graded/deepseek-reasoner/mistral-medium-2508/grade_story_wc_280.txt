<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lydia's synesthesia and ghostly nature are embodied through specific sensory details ("taste of burnt caramel"), and her micro-choice to intervene reveals a hierarchy of values. Elias's despair is legible through concrete action (clutching pills), though his characterization is necessarily secondary. The final choice—passing the coin—is earned by her prior causality as a guide between acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias steps into the "next act," with cost legible when he pockets the pills. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks (maze shifting) and cadence shifts (orchard sighing) reweight stakes. The timeline fracture concept is taught early but slightly underexplored, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orchard is indispensable, constraining choice (maze shifts unspool paths) and charging the final image (trees clapping like an audience). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause"), filtered through Lydia's synesthetic perception. Spatial choreography is coherent and evolves with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lydia's agency under the Accumulative lens: her intertwining fingers with branches pulls the timeline taut, forcing a confrontation with possibility. The dominant stake (despair vs. hope) tightens through this deepening, with cost visible when Elias flinches and pockets the pills. Minor deduction as Lydia's personal stakes remain vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action (coin passing, orchard sighing) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to despair through the conceptual repricing of "encore" as quiet intervention. Subtext operates in gestures (Elias's hunched shoulders) and silences, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia ("music tasted like hope"). Voice is consistent and lyrical, modulating under pressure without convergence. Experimental compression (time folding like a handkerchief) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slightly overripe in peak beats ("the color of dusk dissolving into indigo"). No loops or artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm supports emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story, synesthesia, and temporal fracture feels fresh and inevitable. The tarot coin and orchard are irreplaceable elements transformed through specific grounding. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes or template plots.</comment>
