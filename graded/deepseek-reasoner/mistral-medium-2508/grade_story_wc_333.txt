<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through the meteorite pick and locket memory. The final choice to "let the locked thing decide" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the man's disappearance and the hair going limp. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her rule versus the hair's pulse. Embodied emotion is strong, like the hair humming "like a held breath."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the girl waking and a door opening reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The persistent constraint of her rule and mother's locket shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the man's snarled disappointment and the hair's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused on the shop and objects, which constrain choice (the ribbon resists tools) and charge the final image (starlight, ozone). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like "scent of oil" and "grime-streaked glass." The nexus and starlight evolve causally, dissolving into the cosmic hush. The lock of hair functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to listen to the hair's idea forces a trade-off (freeing the idea, not the girl). Cost is legible in the man's anger and the shop's disorientation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from physical picking to memory listening. However, the man's external pressure is somewhat static, lacking adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, like the ribbon unravelling into a map of a question. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the greatest secrets weren’t hidden behind locks" but envelop you. Subtext operates in implication, such as the locket never opened. One minor slip: the line "the boldest act wasn’t opening, but letting the locked thing decide" borders on thematic statement but is anchored in the immediate action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "the city’s alleys bled into silence." Rhythm controls pressure, accelerating with short sentences during disorientation. Purposeful elision (e.g., the man's identity) is taught early and pays off in ambiguity. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, like the man's rough demand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, like "ribbon the color of bruised twilight." Syntax varies naturally, with rhythmic control in peaks ("The walls dissolved into starlight"). One minor mixed metaphor ("blooming across the counter" slightly clashes with "labyrinth") but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of locksmith magic and metaphysical stakes, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, like the meteorite pick and bruised twilight ribbon. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, rooted in the particular memory of braiding fears.</comment>
