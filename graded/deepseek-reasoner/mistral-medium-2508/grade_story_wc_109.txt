<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eldrin's obsession with silence is concretely embodied through tactile interactions with the booklet and stone. His final choice to dissolve into the quiet is earned by prior causality, with the cost visible in the scattering pages and his smile. The characterization avoids diagnostic speech, showing contradiction through his tactile relationship with absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building density through layered silences toward a decisive Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with undeniable cost as the booklet scatters and Eldrin becomes "another coordinate." Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with the storm-scrubbed world and lone star anchoring the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The ridge fort's stones hold the "ghost of a tide" of the defender's vigil, and the crumbling watchtower provides the literal and figurative lee for Eldrin's mapping. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eldrin's agency under the accumulative lens, his act of retelling deepening the silence's weight until it necessitates his dissolution. The cost is unmistakable: the loss of the booklet and his own form. The dominant stake (mapping the night) tightens through a single meaningful cadence shift into erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of silence as both wound and cradle emerges organically from the particulars of the defender's vigil and Eldrin's collection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the map is in erasure—that reweights all prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature fixated on absence and texture. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, modulating to match the accumulating silence. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like a splinter of ice," "like gilded snow") is consistent and purposeful, never muddy. Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with the scene's needs, from long, accumulating sentences to the final, stark fragments. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept of mapping silence is brilliantly original and fully committed to, synthesizing a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar thematic ground. The unconventional choice to build a plot from absences heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
