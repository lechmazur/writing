<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and artistic struggle are concretely embodied through turpentine-rough hands and failed canvases. His weary curiosity feels earned, driving the pivotal choice to place the brooch without hesitation. The final endurance—"wry and weary, and got to work"—carries visible cost, foreclosing his former stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of erosion and discovery tightens through rain trails and chapel groove. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the brooch's return and straightened rain. The "threshing" concept remains slightly oblique but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the island's "slow hunger" pressures every choice, from the salt-cracked mud to the bioluminescent veins. The brooch and chapel altar constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—rain falls in "crooked trails," air smells of "iron and old incense."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density: the brooch discovery deepens into the chapel ritual, then the cavern vision. Agency is clear in Elias's choice to offer the brooch, foreclosing his passive painting. Cost is legible in the damp paintbrush and altered dreams, though the "threshing" stakes could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erosion and convergence are embodied in the island's geography and Elias's psyche. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the brooch as "offering" reweights prior struggle without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the rain straightening, implying cosmic rebalancing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature favoring geologic metaphors ("scabbed over by time"). The amber woman's dialogue ("voice the sound of waves dragging over pebbles") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor register drift in "fossilized map of the island’s forgotten veins" feels slightly academic but doesn't break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("the tide had stolen another hour of sleep"). One minor mixed metaphor: "salt-cracked mud" slightly clashes with "trapped sunbeam" glint. No loops or scaffolding; momentum accelerates toward closure. Read-aloud test passes with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic decay and mystical ecology. The amber brooch as ritual object rather than key transforms the treasure-hunt trope. Specificity in worldbuilding (desalination rigs, turpentine-rough hands) grounds the concept. Risk-taking in the ambiguous "threshing" pays off through atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
