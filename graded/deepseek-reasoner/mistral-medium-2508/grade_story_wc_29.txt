<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is exceptionally embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. Her "cautiously hopeful" heart and final choice to keep listening feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her continued isolation. The grad student interaction briefly applies status pressure, reinforcing her outsider status.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the signal shifts from predatory to curious, reconfiguring the stakes. Cost is legible in the final image: "the air still thrummed with something unspoken" and Liora's continued defiance. Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio station functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice through its forgotten current and aging equipment. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through Liora's expertise, like "headphones warm against her ears." The charts are a recurring object that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the causal lens. Her decision to transmit the subsonic frequency creates a meaningful tightening that narrows options and provokes a response. The cost is unmistakable: the pressure in her skull, the ache in her teeth, and the altered campus dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of cosmic and academic power plays, resisting tidy resolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: divisions become "scars—proof they’d survived something." Subtext operates powerfully in the signal's shift from dare to conversation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature rooted in Liora's expertise: "static hissed through the headphones like a nest of angry stars." POV is stable and deeply embodied. The single dialogue exchange is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistently sharp and voice-motivated. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during transmission and breathing at closure. Every sentence advances story or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic signal interference and academic politics feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, verifiable detail (frequencies, subsonic gambit) avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking in the high-concept premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through.</comment>
