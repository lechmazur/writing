<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied emotion and a clear hierarchy of values, but the chronicler's final choice to give away the cicada, while thematically resonant, lacks a fully dramatized internal conflict in the moment of decision, slightly diminishing the felt cost of her renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the hermit crab's new shell and the submerged dream reweight the theme of transitions with undeniable conceptual cost, and the lens holds firmly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pools are not merely decorative; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through a distinct professional POV, with the "hairline crack" in the new shell serving as a masterful, concrete detail that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's attentive agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive act of giving away the cicada. The cost is legible in the transfer itself and the chronicler's damp sleeve, though the pressure could have been slightly more visceral in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of transitions emerges organically from concrete particulars—the ripple, the crab, the cicada's warmth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the powerful final image of submerged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature with excellent rhythmic control. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and consistently filtered through the chronicler's specific, professional worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "humming potential" slightly verges on abstract label-speak in a peak beat, but it is quickly grounded by the subsequent simile ("like the air before a summer storm"), preventing significant clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool ecology, grief, and a jade cicada feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, lived detail of the chronicler's occupation transforms a familiar thematic concern into a singular artistic stance, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
