<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Qishti's frugality and empirical irony are embodied in micro-choices (counting tiles, tracing lines) that culminate in a credible renunciation. His final choice—kneeling in recognition—is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with a visible, felt cost of a lifetime's assumptions rewritten.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (dominant Accumulative/Textural). Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "some devotions are too vast for numbers" reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The linkage from discovery to understanding is seamless and taught, with the tile's schematic acting as the accumulative pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The palace setting is a micro-setting that pressures choice (avoiding guards) and the tile is an object-as-setting that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Qishti's professional bias, with the "scent of damp and something older" perfectly anchoring the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Qishti's agency under the Accumulative lens: his decision to press the tile forces the final, decisive deepening. The cost is unmistakable on the page—the schematic rewriting itself onto his skin—and this price charges the final image, reconfiguring his relationship to the cosmos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of empirical observation vs. mystical devotion emerges entirely through event and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final line—"some devotions are too vast for numbers"—is an earned insight that reweights prior material without moralizing, arising from the concrete particulars of the tile and altar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional. The voice—a blend of scholarly precision and poetic wonder—is perfectly calibrated to the POV and remains consistent under peak pressure. Purposeful elision (the exact nature of the "covenant") is taught and paid off in the conceptual repricing of the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is flawlessly integrated, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("split like a fruit revealing its seed") is precise and legible, serving character and pressure. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical precision and mystical revelation feels both fresh and inevitable. The core concept—"encrypted devotion"—is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
