<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "unbuild" is clear and rooted in her profession and personal loss. Her embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, particularly her decision to hurl the halo fragment. The final endurance feels earned, though her internal contradiction could be more active in-scene during the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where time's texture is redefined from something to discover to something to survive. The cost is legible in her ragged breath and shaking hands. Causality holds through the taught pattern of fading and unfolding images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action. The environment's hyperbolic geometry is a key pressure point that shapes the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens: the photographs' disintegration forces a reactive choice. The cost of her act is felt in the garden's groan and her physical collapse. The dominant stake of being trapped in "when" is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of time's texture emerges organically from concrete events and the final image of feeling the grain of time. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density. Rhythm is excellent, though there is minor synonym churn ("disintegrated photograph dust"). A single mixed metaphor ("voices rising into a chorus") appears in a high-pressure beat but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of metaphysical concepts and grounded, sensory detail. The core premise of a maze that traps one in time is fresh and fully committed to. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
