<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and deeply embodied, rooted in specific regret ("her hands too busy shaping molten silver to cup the words as they fled"). Her final micro-choice to let the names change is earned by the on-page causality of the ritual. The final realization ("preservation wasn’t holding tight") feels character-particular and avoids diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, escalating through density of imagery and a decisive cadence shift into the ritual's climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear, felt cost on the page: "her shadow stretching long and unbroken... finally free of the weight of silence." Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is indispensable, actively pressuring the ritual and charging the final image ("the walls wept"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action. The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-settings that constrain choice and reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, decisive intensification of the ritual act. The dominant stake (preserving lost names) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens into a reconfiguration of its very definition. The cost is legible in the physical transformation of the sanctum and Elira's emotional release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of preservation through the final image of the names "humming just beneath the ice." The concept of loss is reweighted without moralizing, achieving profound emotional and conceptual complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("blue-dark," "snowmelt ardor"). The lyrical, compressed prose is consistent, voice-motivated, and perfectly legible. The patterned elision of the ritual's mechanics is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, though one minor potential register drift exists ("snowmelt ardor," which could be seen as slightly elevated, but is arguably voice-motivated). Momentum is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lost wax caster, a punched card, and a ceremonial rope into a ritual of sonic memory is a highly original, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration is a bold, specific choice that heightens stakes.</comment>
