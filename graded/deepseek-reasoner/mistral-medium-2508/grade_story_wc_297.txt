<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and deeply embodied through her scars, which function as both map and compass. Her final choice to run across the bridge is earned by a lifetime of heeding painful echoes. The encounter with her future self creates a poignant internal contradiction, charging her endurance with visible cost. A hairline deduction for the future-self dialogue bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora's understanding of the covenant is repriced, landing with the cost of early arrival. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation driven by pattern density and cadence shifts. The future-self encounter, while potent, introduces a minor situational complication that slightly strains the accumulative weave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and maze are not merely descriptive but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The yew clipping and Liora's scars function as micro-settings, their tactile properties directly shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's urgent, pain-calibrated perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, with the maze and her scars applying coherent pressure that tightens through cadence shifts. The cost of heeding "too late" and arriving "early" is legible on the page, foreclosing the path of passive waiting. The stakes transform from personal seeking to custodianship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the intersection of scars, time, and listening, resisting moralizing. The final image of the blooming scar offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of heeding echoes. The eclipsed covenant is a concept integrated through action, not statement, rewarding reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet urgent, rooted in bodily sensation. The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence ("the glade *screamed*—not in pain, but in recognition"). Purposeful elision (the covenant's exact nature) serves the accumulative pattern and is paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic and largely effective, though minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "the intersection of dreams *unfolded*: a tapestry of moments..."). Rhythm is expertly controlled, accelerating through the maze and calming at closure. One distinct figurative stack slightly muddles clarity at a pivotal moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concepts (eclipsed covenant, sentient maze, temporal intersection) feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in the future-self encounter heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
