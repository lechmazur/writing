<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("his breath shallow, his fingers tracing the glass") and a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. The final merging is earned by prior causality, with visible cost ("Pain lanced through his skull"). Interior contradiction is shown through the silent, watching brain versus the ghost-like exterior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: Kael's choice to merge the brains directly causes the closure (history stopping its rewrite). Closure is a decisive change with clear on-page cost ("Pain lanced through his skull... the Schism’s wound stitching shut"). Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with the dojo and jars established within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("moss-slicked edges humming," "boots leaving wet prints on the tatami"). The jars function as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. However, the floating dojo itself, while atmospheric, does not actively pressure choices or supply resources that alter the outcome, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing dissolution and reclaiming wholeness) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens. Veyra's arrival and declaration tighten pressure, forcing Kael's agential choice to merge, which forecloses the custody path with a severe, on-page cost. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency and the cost is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness vs. numbness emerges organically from the central conflict and is resolved through a resonant, non-literal image ("the crushing, glorious *all* of it"). The final line, "we defeat the numbness," is earned by the preceding action and reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistent and apt, with prose that reflects Kael's fractured state. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, especially Veyra's lines which slice through pretense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally concise and vivid, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm that accelerates with the scene's pressure. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The final paragraph's cadence shift ("The storm’s last drops fell like blessings") provides a perfect, purposeful resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a clone custody battle fought via a literal split brain is highly original and fully committed to. The combination of sci-fi and dojo elements feels organic, not checklisty. The emotional truth of defeating numbness through radical, painful integration is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
