<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with her trembling hands and avoidance of songs revealing internal contradiction. Her final choice to sing feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her burning throat and tight chest. The micro-choice to reach for her mother's memory demonstrates a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly as pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: "her throat burned, her chest tight with the weight of what she’d almost let die." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("tendrils brittle as old parchment"), filtered through Mira's expertise. The environment evolves causally with the song, becoming a character in the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density as the song's power intensifies. The dominant stake (arbor's survival) is clear early, and Mira's agency drives the tightening through her singing. Cost is legible in her physical strain, though the external pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between artifice (stories) and truth (songs). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of connected threads. No moralizing; the final whisper to the arbor carries earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with mechanical metaphor integrated naturally ("cogs of the cosmos"). POV remains stable and deeply filtered through Mira's tinkerer sensibility. Rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly during the song's crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Minor artifacts include occasional cliché ("liquid gold") and one paraphrase loop ("half-remembered dream" followed by "no one remembered"). Overall momentum remains strong with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanized and organic elements feels inevitable in hindsight. The whimsical tinkerer concept transforms familiar tropes through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off without obscuring clarity, particularly in the closure image.</comment>
