<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is precise and embodied, with sensory-specific interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation into "the map" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shard's transformation and her relinquishment of fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds strong. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora's choice to step through the seam reconfigures her reality with undeniable cost felt in the shard's change and the spaceport's dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is a tactile, pressure-laden environment that constrains choice (e.g., the cold metal of the cargo lift guiding her senses). The green shard functions as a micro-setting, its evolving properties charging the final image and Liora's choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the hybrid lens: finding the shard, heeding the voice, and confronting the seam. A meaningful tightening occurs when the seam redirects, forcing her inward turn, with cost legible in the shard's cold burn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth as a woven choice emerges organically from the shard's metamorphosis and the final image of Liora becoming the map. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptually rich voice that modulates under pressure ("the universe bent to meet her"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the man's vanishing) is taught and paid off at closure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifice, achieving high information density ("a lattice of vibrations, scents, and the faintest electric thrum"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and heightens closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of sensory mapping between worlds is a fresh, specific synthesis. Risk-taking in poetic compression and non-linear causality heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
