<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the shifting weight of the stone and the sensory degradation under stress ("air tasted like ozone and old pennies"). The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the crumbled flowers and dissolved stone. Minor deduction for a slight abstraction at the climax ("a shape, a ripple in the gravity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through patterns (coffee, flowers, stone) to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with undeniable cost—the destroyed tools and his resolve to continue. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. The final Conceptual Repricing ("stored, not deleted") is fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action ("crystals trembled"). The micro-setting (stone, flowers) functions as an extension of the environment, applying palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift in the chamber, where the gravity pools and the tools are consumed. The cost is legible on the page in the destroyed compass and grounds. The protagonist's agency—his choice to kneel and wait—drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: memory as excavation, not deletion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the gravity... was always hungry") that reweights the premise without moralizing. The complexity of endured loss versus futile pursuit is fully earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, rhythmic prose that heightens pressure ("a sound like tearing paper"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the character's professional and personal lens. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated ("like a shadow with a flame"). Minor register drift in the peak beat ("a shape, a ripple in the gravity") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mundane and cosmic elements (coffee grounds and gravity pockets). The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, devastating conclusion. Risk-taking in the quiet, endured ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
