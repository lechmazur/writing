<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Her internal conflict between duty and rebellion is embodied through concrete actions like stealing the amber sheet. The final choice to unfetter rather than tame feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sheet's dissolution. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional states at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with density increase and cadence shift reweighting the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the aurora's permanence reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost: "The sculpted hush was gone." Orientation is immediate; all anchors are set by line 4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ice cavern constrains choice and charges the final image, actively groaning "in relief" and becoming "gateways." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Liora's synesthesia. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats prevents a higher score, but the setting is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each chime intensifying the stakes through pattern break and density increase. Cost is legible on the page: the amber sheet crumbles, and the elders' silence is permanently broken. The dominant stake (wonder vs. control) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of control vs. freedom through the final image of the aurora staying. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the ice groaning "in relief." No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic voice ("ribbons of violet and gold"). POV is stable and apt, with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor register drift in peak beats ("architecture—bridges of light") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; most sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent. Minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats ("fractals of emerald and cobalt") that slightly obscures immediacy, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia, forbidden music, and ecological wonder feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. No derivative or template elements.</comment>
