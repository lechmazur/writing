<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characters are vividly realized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—Elias's precision versus his sharp tongue, Liora's calculated smirk versus her eagerness. Their final partnership is earned through prior causality, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The mechanical arm and diplomatic fierceness are embodied traits that alter tactics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, embodied perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the key's discovery reconfigures their relationship from opponents to partners. Causal lens holds: the duel's moves are because/therefore linkages that narrow options. Orientation is slightly delayed (who/where clarified at ~100 words), but the disorientation serves the coded mystery, so no penalty. The persistent constraint of the sundial's code shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the glass atrium, brook, and sundial constrain choices and charge the final image. The sundial's coded angles directly enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "damp earth and crushed mint"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly across the duel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: each thrust and parry narrows options toward the sundial's revelation. Cost is legible when Elias slaps the card, sparks fly from steel meeting brass, and the key emerges with tangible consequence. The dominant stake (ethical governance debate) is tested through concrete, on-page actions that force trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the duel's coded negotiation—turning questions into destinations—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of partnered silhouettes. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (e.g., the needle card as challenge). Thematic resonance arises from particulars like the sundial's painted code and the brook's waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature ("quiet insistence of a brook"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("You still believe answers are the point"). Voice modulation under pressure is effective, with rhythmic control. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (e.g., Council's verdict) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("like shattered diamonds"). Minor artifact: "the brook burbled on" slightly softens closure momentum. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept feels fresh and inevitable—the duel-as-negotiation synthesizes philosophy, coded puzzles, and character depth. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (mechanical arm, diplomatic fierceness). Risk-taking in structure (dialogue-heavy action) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
