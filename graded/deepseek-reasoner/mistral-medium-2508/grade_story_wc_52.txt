<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Widow's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief; her internal contradiction between practical endurance and haunting absence is embodied in her carving. The final micro-choice to keep the lion instead of selling it is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, with specific, character-particular interiority like "her hands learning the language of absence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she crystallizes her stance of letting go, with cost legible in the final image of the lion on the windowsill. Orientation is immediate; the pattern of carving and selling tightens through the girl's question and the dream, culminating in a decisive shift. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable; the rain-beaded skylight loft constrains choice by framing her ritual and charges the final image when rain paints stripes on the carving. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV (e.g., "damp cedar and the faint musk of sawdust"). The loft and tools are tactile and evolve with her emotional state, supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative pressure: the girl's question and the dream deepen the stake of "containment" versus "release," forcing a crystallization of her stance. Agency is clear in her choice to keep the carving, foreclosing the path of selling her grief. Cost is felt in the ache of her hands and the cold kettle, altering her tactics. One meaningful tightening is sufficient under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" emerges organically through images and actions, resisting moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lion kept as a lesson. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, like the girl's ink-stained fingers or the steam curling into unnamed shapes. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic yet controlled perceptual signature ("light fractured like old glass"). POV is stable and deeply embodied; dialogue (though minimal) is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught early and pay off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional (e.g., "jingled like hollow promises"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming grief into art through grounded choices; the synthesis of carving and loss feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, with a singular artistic stance. No derivative echoes or safety hedging.</comment>
