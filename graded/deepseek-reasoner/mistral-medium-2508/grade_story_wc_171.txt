<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Veyra and Kael exhibit profound interior contradiction through embodied micro-choices—her "operatively gentle" exhale versus his white-knuckled grip. The final choice to sign is earned by the painful callback to his past idealism, forcing a stance crystallization with visible cost in his shaking hand and unraveling voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered imagery (clipboard notches, terrace stones, celestial dance) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is legible in the "parchment curling slightly at the edges, as if resisting the finality" and Kael's human unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient terrace functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the finale—its stones "hummed with the names of the dead" and its shadows stretch long in the closing image. The ebony clipboard evolves from prop to crucible, its notches physically recording the cost of each fragile peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Veyra's strategic use of the twenty-year-old signature forces a deepening that reweights the stake from terms to redemption. The cost is unmistakable in Kael's trembling hand and the "quiet violence of hope" that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the clipboard's notches, the ink from ashes—culminating in a non-literal answer: "Redemption wasn’t a single act... one imperfect signature at a time." The final image of washing rain and indifferent stars offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation ("lavender, dust, the ghost of something like peace"). Purposeful elision (wars referenced but not detailed) serves accumulative design. Dialogue carries subtext and status shifts—Kael's dry laugh versus his unraveling voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; high density with every image pulling double duty (ebony clipboard's "polished grief"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-rich—"stars aligning just enough to fool men" echoes in "stars kept dancing." Sentence rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war negotiation tropes through specific texture (ash-based ink, olive branch pen). Risk-taking in quiet climax paid off by visceral cost—the signature that "bled into the parchment" transforms familiar material into singular artistic stance with undeniable conceptual integrity.</comment>
