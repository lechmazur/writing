<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a quiet, burning desire for justice. Her "nervously confident" energy is embodied in trembling hands, and her final choice is earned by prior causality. However, her emotional state is occasionally summarized ("profound, aching peace") rather than fully dramatized with contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds perfectly. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with clear cost: the nail becomes inert, the ghost unravels, and the wind shifts. The orientation is immediate, and the because/therefore linkage from research to discovery to action is flawless and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The "spongey dread," "mutated, rubbery moss," and "sterile hum" of the station create a potent atmosphere. The copper nail is a micro-setting that powerfully constrains the choice and charges the final image, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency under the Causal lens. The dominant stake (restoring honor) is clear, and the pressure tightens as she locates the coordinates, unearths the coffin, and performs the ritual. The cost is legible in the air growing "sharp and cold" and the nail's purpose being fulfilled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of restoring balance emerges organically from the specific act of reversing an exile, culminating in the "clean wind" as a resonant, non-literal answer. It avoids moralizing, though the final line ("redrawn the borders of history") edges toward thematic declaration, slightly reducing the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptive, professional consciousness. The prose has a distinct, textured rhythm ("spongey dread," "verdignis light"). The single line of dialogue is goal-driven and pivotal. The voice remains consistent and compelling under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and vivid, specific diction. A minor instance of near-synonym churn ("spongey dread" used twice) and a slightly elevated phrase ("nervously confident energy") prevent a higher score, but these are hairline slips that do not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of "reversible exile" is ingeniously fresh and specific, synthesized perfectly with the character's motive and the broken world's setting. The combination feels inevitable and wholly original, executed with conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking that pays off.</comment>
