<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("his heart a heavy weight"). The final choice to seek everlasting truths is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his shifted mission. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost ("building a new constellation"). The lens holds from the pattern of fading slides to the discovery of eternal vows, and orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library and lantern slides are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("crystalline shelves," "frost-veined floor"), filtered through the POV's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from measuring decay to discovering eternal vows. The cost is legible in the Archivist's renewed purpose and the reweighting of the dominant stake against oblivion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shift from preserving echoes to capturing essence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of meaning against oblivion, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("a keeper of ghosts"). Prose rhythm and diction are controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the rune's origin) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and vivid ("colors desaturating like a bruise"), and sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory preservation and metaphysical essence. The transformation of the Archivist's mission feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
