<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a consistent, quiet defiance. Her "luminous regret" is an embodied, character-specific emotion that compels her high-stakes choice to build her own dream. The final renunciation of borrowed dreams and the profound exertion felt on-page earn her Charged Poise ending, with the cost of spiritual drainage made visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: the river stone's metamorphosis reweights the premise, making hope tangible and active. The causal lens holds firmly from observation to experimentation. The cost is legible in the "peculiar draining, a profound exertion," and the final image of the transformed stone charges the ending with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is a micro-setting that constrains choice, serving as her isolated post and laboratory. The river stone evolves from a grounding tool to the story's central charged object, its transformation defining the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: her discovery of the anomaly leads to cross-referencing, which fuels her desperate theory and final experiment. The stakes—preserving hope—tighten meaningfully through this sequence. The cost of her exertion is felt on the page, making the escalation legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of individualized hope vs. collective complacency emerges entirely through events and images, most powerfully in the contrasting video logs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the stone's metamorphosis, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow's absence from contemporary logs, implying the cost of lost ambition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, melancholic voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity ("a sorrowful glow, like that of a dying star"). Purposeful compression is used in the summary of her research, which is taught and pays off at closure without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("sorrowful glow, like that of a dying star") is precise and enhances clarity. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, accelerating through her discovery and culminating in the draining exertion of her dream.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of shareable dreams causing creative atrophy is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The shadow as a manifestation of creative potential is an ingenious inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its implications, and the specific, lived detail of the video comparison grounds its high-concept ideas.</comment>
