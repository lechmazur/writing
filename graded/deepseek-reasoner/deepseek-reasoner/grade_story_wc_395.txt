<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to a high-stakes choice. Her quiet obsession is embodied in her meticulous work, and her final decision feels earned by prior causality. The felt cost is visible in her understanding of the "void where honor should have been." Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic flavor in the final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens is established and held. The closure is a decisive change (uploading the files) with a clear, felt cost (her career is forfeit) and a resonant reconfiguration of the archive's silence. The coordinates and safe combination provide a tight, earned linkage from the digital clues to the physical proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The server cavern and derelict warehouse are vivid, purposeful settings that pressure choices. The patch is a key object that charges the final image, moving from a hidden artifact to a symbol of truth held in her palm. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's professional, attentive POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal obsession to a monumental ethical choice. Each discovery (the void, the numbers, the server, the log) meaningfully tightens the pressure and narrows Elara's options. The final choice to upload the files carries the undeniable cost of her career, crystallizing the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of truth versus corporate lies. The final image of the patch and the reconfigured silence of the archive offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of where deleted files—and honor—go. The concept of "sensed absence" is fully realized without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's perceptive, analytical voice. The prose has a distinct texture, blending technical and poetic diction appropriate to her role. The single line of dialogue (Aris's log) is effectively integrated. Minor, occasional ornamental phrasing prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. However, some phrases like "brightly attentive curator" and "study in sensed absence" lean slightly ornamental, creating minor momentum drag. The closure beat remains powerful and unaffected by these minor artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital archivist and a cosmic conspiracy feels fresh and specific. The core concept is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices, particularly the translation of a digital clue into a physical coordinate. The resolution is earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
