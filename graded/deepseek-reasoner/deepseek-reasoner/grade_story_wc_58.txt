<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and particular, driving her to project presence in a way that reveals character under pressure. Her final understanding feels earned through embodied experience with the thread, not diagnostic summary. The emotional progression is credible and layered, with visible cost in the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory density to a decisive Conceptual Repricing at closure. The crimson thread's warmth triggers a vivid shift that reconfigures Elara's understanding of healing with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is intensely purposeful, with the garden and palace acting as a micro-setting that charges the final image. The carpet is a recurring object that constrains choice and becomes the catalyst for closure. Sensory details are selective, vivid, and fully filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification via the sensory flood from the thread. This deepens the dominant stake (understanding healing) and narrows Elara's epistemological options. The cost is legible in the reconfiguration of the garden's solitude into fullness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of integration emerges entirely through image and action, culminating in the tapestry metaphor that reweights all prior material. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "explained absences" is fully dramatized, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature that modulates beautifully under pressure. The prose is character, with syntax and rhythm reflecting Elara's consciousness. The elision of direct interview questions is a taught pattern that serves the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens clarity. Sentences accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs, particularly in the sensory flood passage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The synthesis of concept, object, and method feels organic and inevitable. The risk of a quiet, accumulative structure pays off with high stakes and coherence.</comment>
