<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, painful loss, compelling her choices. Her "featherly determination" solidifying into steel is a credible emotional progression under pressure. However, her internal contradiction and embodied emotion in the climactic discovery beat are summarized ("finally understood") rather than fully dramatized in-scene, slightly blunting the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (reunion) with a resonant reconfiguration of understanding, landing with clear cost (the fractured world waiting). The causal lens holds: her actions (finding the logbook, analyzing the grain) directly lead to the solution. The final image reconfigures the maze's meaning through a child's faith, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The farmhouse, the prism terrace, and the transformed maze are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara's professional and maternal POV. Crucially, the maze's structure and the grain in the wooden furniture constrain her choices and directly enable the closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: each discovery (logbook, terrace, grain-map) meaningfully tightens options and changes knowledge. The cost is the risk of failure and the palpable relief of success, legible in the final embrace. A single, potent tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of love and logic, faith and structure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the sanctuary is built on a child's faith in his mother's skill—that reweights the entire premise without moralizing. It embraces complexity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, architect's-eye view of the world. The prose has a distinct texture, though a slight tendency toward summary in peak emotional beats ("finally understood") prevents a higher score. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and vivid, controlled metaphor ("fractured hush," "dusty eyes"). A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in "finally understood," which summarizes an earned realization rather than rendering it with full immediacy. No loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corn maze, a pilot's logbook, and the butterfly effect into a mechanism of salvation is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
