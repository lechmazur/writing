<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's "functionally creative" trait is embodied through specific, goal-directed observation and micro-choices, culminating in an earned, decisive act of creation. Her motivation to find "new equations for hope" is dramatized through her tactile interaction with the environment and the sextant, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final renunciation of the spaceport's original purpose for a new one carries a quiet, felt cost of solitude and monumental effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly: each discovery (silence, geometry, sextant, conduit network) logically motivates the next action. Closure is a decisive physical change (the system works) that reconfigures the space's potential with a clear cost of three days of solitary labor. The final image of steam is an on-page, undeniable proof of cost and success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that actively constrains and enables Elara's choices, from the "maze of intentions" she deciphers to the specific "capillary pipes" she repurposes. The sextant and the dome glass are not just described but are essential tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, pressure escalates through a series of "because/therefore" linkages from discovery to plan to execution. The dominant stake (finding functional purpose) is tested by the monumental task, and the cost of her focused, solitary labor is legible. The final successful circulation of water is a decisive tightening earned entirely by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection and repurposing entropy emerges organically from the specific events and images, most powerfully in the final plume of steam—a "miracle of physics, not magic." The story offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of hope through concrete, earned action, avoiding moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's engineer's perspective, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices "hopeful geometry" and "energy flows." The prose's texture—precise, measured, and occasionally lyrical ("stoic wonder")—is consistent and apt, modulating effectively under the pressure of her focus. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character, setting, and plot simultaneously ("Her plan was to resurrect the terminal..."). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully slows to match the achieved quiet wonder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of repurposing a derelict spaceport into a greenhouse via reclaimed systems is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The execution feels inevitable and authentic, with bold risk-taking in its quiet, technical resolution that fully commits to its premise. The specific lived detail prevents it from feeling like a template.</comment>
