<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("hammered repose," "felt the new quiet like a physical weight"). The final choice and renunciation—becoming a keeper of equilibrium—is earned by her persistent, patient action. A slight deduction for a moment of abstract phrasing ("a profound and unsettling silence") that briefly distances from her specific perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible on the page in the "hammered repose" melting away, replaced by "genuine and effortless tranquility." The lens holds perfectly as pressure accumulates through sensory density and pattern amplification toward the final, decisive image of the bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action. The echo chamber stone and the ice patterns function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. A minor deduction: the "harmonic caves" themselves, while atmospheric, exert less direct pressure on her tactics than the objects she manipulates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, building through her whispered tone and the resonant feedback loop with the ice. The cost is unmistakable in the transformation of her state from "hammered repose" to "effortless tranquility," a palpable price paid for achieving the bloom of hush.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of noise and quiet, reweighting the premise through the final realization: "They had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized." Theme emerges organically from the specific action and image of the bloom, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized with a distinct perceptual signature ("ripple-marks from a lifetime of reading stone"). The prose rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. The patterned elision of the energy beings' nature is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("bloom of hush," "hammered repose"). A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("profound and unsettling silence"/"profound peace") but does not touch the closure beat or obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of weaving absence to create a "bloom of hush" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ideas. The specific, grounded choices in character and world-building transform what could be a familiar trope into a singular, authentic vision. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
