<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his investigation. His professional competence is balanced with genuine struggle, and his final action is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for the "hazy precision" descriptor feeling slightly abstract for a peak-beat trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage throughout; the discovery of the patch and wind data logically leads to the climax. Closure is a decisive change with a clear on-page cost—the cessation of the hum and the return to natural quiet. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The container maze is a masterful micro-setting that actively constrains choice and shapes the entire narrative. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional lens. The environment is the story's central antagonist and amplifier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Causal lens, moving from discovery to theorizing to action. The dominant stake (solving the silence) is clear and tightens effectively. A minor deduction as the final confrontation feels slightly swift, though the cost of inaction is strongly implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unintended consequences and expertise emerges organically from the plot and the poignant detail of the lost patch. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing. Slightly held back by the premise's inherent conceptual neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on professional observation. Prose is controlled and purposeful. The single line "a thick, woolen quiet" is a very minor stylistic risk that slightly jars the otherwise precise lexicon but is legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft. Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm varies effectively with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The description of the wind's behavior is a standout example of clarity and purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of a forensic procedural and a sci-fi/horror concept. The infrasound mechanism feels both original and inevitable in hindsight. Execution is bold and committed, with high conceptual integrity and specificity.</comment>
