<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation transforms from professional curiosity to desperate need with embodied specificity. Her synesthetic perception and emotional degradation under stress feel authentic. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the closing notation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with profound conceptual cost in the final notation. Orientation is immediate; the parallel universe jumps accumulate emotional weight that reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven, filtered through Elara's professional bias. The spaceport repair bay is atmospheric but functions more as mood-setting than as a constraint that actively shapes choices or charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's desperate jumps, each narrowing her options and increasing emotional cost. The final jump is agency-driven and delivers the crucial revelation with undeniable felt cost, perfectly suiting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shard's discovery and the man's confession. The final image of "silent dockyards of the heart" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a strong perceptual signature. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, particularly in describing synesthetic experiences. Elision in the jumps is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with excellent rhythm. Minor thesaurus-churn appears in phrases like "synesthetic tapestry" and "conceptual repricing," creating slight register drift that doesn't harm closure but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping and parallel universe navigation feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific emotional detail and a non-obvious moral calculus about the weight of human failure.</comment>
