<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of grand redemption for service is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfigured silence. Contradictory impulses of sorrow and hope act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building density of sound and image toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with felt cost in the "shared, magnificent inheritance," and the persistent constraint of the silent box shapes all tactics. Orientation is immediate and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The feral loft and beach environment actively constrain choice and supply resources (driftwood, jars, sounds). The music box as a micro-setting object charges the final image decisively. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the poet's professional priority as a translator of sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as he actively gathers and layers sounds to overcome the central silence. A single meaningful deepening occurs as the raw sounds are reconciled into harmony, with cost legible in the final, shared splendor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of translation and redemption emerges organically from events, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the original note joining the captured symphony, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent, voice-motivated lyricism. Purposeful elision (e.g., "forgotten things") is taught and paid off. POV is stable and apt, with diction firmly within the poet's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the closure effect. Minimal scaffold or loop artifacts; a single near-paraphrase ("lonesome splendor" reappearing) is functional and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of capturing sounds to translate silence is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic and singular, not derivative.</comment>
