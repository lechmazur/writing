<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in grief and rebellion, and intensifies through the tattoo's creation. Her internal conflict between stillness and movement is embodied in the act of tattooing. The final choice to map her past onto her skin is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "obsidian grace" phrasing, but interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with density increasing through the tattoo's progression. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara transcends exile by internalizing the cosmos, with cost legible in the final image of her "portable eternity." Orientation is clear by line 4. The persistent constraint of the ban shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The twilight garden, tattoo tools, and moonstone dust function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The garden's edge and the misty sea provide spatial choreography that supports the closure. The moonstone's luminescence is integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the tattoo's completion serving as a decisive intensification that reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable in the "punctuation mark of pain" and the final transformation of grief into liberation. The dominant stake (rebellion against the ban) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of tattooing forbidden constellations, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory's value. The final image of a "portable eternity" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the gaps and silences Elara observes and embodies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends poetic precision with emotional intensity. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon, and syntactic control is exceptional under pressure. The voice modulates effectively with the emotional beats, from stillness to transcendence. No dialogue present, so those bullets are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph's cadence perfectly supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory rebellion and cosmic tattooing. Specific, verifiable details (moonstone dust, constellation names) create authenticity. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation feels inevitable in hindsight due to grounded character choices.</comment>
