<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her choice to engage with the quartz. Her internal conflict is embodied through tactile sensations (e.g., "shock, not of pain but of pure frequency") and her final renunciation of defiance for paraphrase is earned. The dissolution of boundaries is a credible endurance with visible cost, foreclosing her exiled path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her internal shift crystallizes options with cost felt in the "seismic shift within her soul." Orientation is clear by line 3. The pattern of sensory density increasing toward the quartz interaction pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade constrains choice (she must physically engage it) and charges the final image (her poem is left beneath it). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "cool, vibrating surface"), filtered through her poetic bias. The atrium's deep blue stone and frozen lake above pressure her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (striving through boundaries) escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase in the quartz interaction, narrowing her options to paraphrase or fail. Cost is legible in the dissolution of self/stone boundaries. Agency is endurance and attention, foreclosing her exiled identity with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action (e.g., quartz yielding like mist), not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the poem that reweights prior material ("silence that contains the deepest music"). Subtext operates in implication (exile as silencing, ban as rigidity).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("lantern-moth hush"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within her poetic lexicon ("cloud-shadow poet"). No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("a fragile quiet of held breath and suspended wings"). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves pressure (e.g., "quartz becoming soft as mist"). Minor register elevation in peak beats but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geology and poetry feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical, accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity (cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade) anchors universals. Transforms the "poet in exile" trope through grounded sensory particulars.</comment>
