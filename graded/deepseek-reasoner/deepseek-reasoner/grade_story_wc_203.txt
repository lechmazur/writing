<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to uncover hidden truths. His skillfully observant nature is not just a label but drives his actions, as seen when he analyzes the dust patterns. His final choice to repair the cylinder is a micro-choice that reveals his values and provides a satisfying, earned closure. A slight deduction for a minor lack of internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through discovered clues (dust pattern, ghostly flashes, misaligned medallion) leading to a decisive change. The closure is a clear Decisive Change—the ghost is laid to rest—with a legible cost in the final image of her peaceful fading. Causality is tight and the orientation is immediate and effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and integral to the plot. Specific, purposeful details like the "powdered sugar" dust and "water-stained plaster medallion" create atmosphere. Crucially, the environment constrains choice and charges the final image; the hidden compartment and the safe are key to resolving the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a series of discovered clues that deepen the mystery and narrow Leo's options. The dominant stake (laying the ghost to rest) is clear. The cost is felt in the ghost's initial anxiety and final peace. Agency is strong, though the final act is more discovery than a difficult choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the resolution of a forgotten tragedy, exploring the weight of buried secrets and the peace of revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the repaired machine and the ghost's smile. It avoids moralizing, achieving its effect through concrete action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Leo's professional, observant consciousness. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture, with a perceptive signature ("skillfully observant, his eyes missing nothing"). The limited dialogue is functional and the ghost's communication through images is a effective, voice-consistent choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("a thick layer of dust, soft as powdered sugar, coated every surface"). Rhythm is varied and purposeful. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost-seeing repairman is a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar elements. The execution feels organic, not checklist-driven, grounded in lived-in detail. It commits fully to its concept. A minor deduction as the core concept, while well-executed, doesn't feel radically unprecedented.</comment>
