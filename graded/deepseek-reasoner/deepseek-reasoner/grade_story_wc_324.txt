<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("persistently curious"), compelling a higher-stakes choice. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in the line "Elara’s curiosity sharpened into focus." The final choice to find the proof is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost of this shift from listener to activist could be more embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: the discovery of the photograph leads to the use of the hearing aid, which reveals the secret and compels the search for the box. Closure is a decisive change (finding the proof) with a resonant reconfiguration (the atmosphere softens). The cost is legible in the line "the box of truths heavy in her arms," making the new duty felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("thick, vaporous tendrils," "mossy tile"). The environment constrains and guides the action, evolving from a "reeling hush" to a "peaceful quiet" to signal closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the whisper compels Elara to ask "Who?", which deepens the knowledge and raises the stakes from a personal passing to a historical crime. The cost is unmistakable in the shift of her duty and the physical weight of the box she must now carry into the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent actions incidentally righting wrongs emerges organically from the convergence of her duty and the discovered crime. The final image of the mist parting is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of carrying burdens for the voiceless. No moralizing; the concept is integrated through specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in lines like "the air held a reeling hush." The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The limited dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying crucial subtext in the whispered plea.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and no noticeable loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("a sob of pure energy"). Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with the discovery and softening at closure. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of supernatural and mystery genres. It is fully committed to and transformed by specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
