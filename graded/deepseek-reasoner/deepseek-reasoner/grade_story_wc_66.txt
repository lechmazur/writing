<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is singular, concrete, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to listen rather than teach. Her internal contradiction—official duty versus illicit truth-seeking—is dramatized through micro-choices like cloaking the window. The final renunciation of her initial goal for a new understanding is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, held perfectly. A clear Decisive Change occurs: Elara abandons her flawed method ("teach") for the correct one ("translate"). Cost is legible in the final image of her transcribing the dust's song. The broadcaster's sign-off is a causal trigger that narrows options and changes knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio's glow are not just atmospheric; they actively constrain and enable Elara's choices, charging the final image. The setting is a crucible that pressures her actions, from the necessary precaution of the dark cloth to the dust itself becoming the medium for her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (ending the story famine) tightens through a meaningful turn: the broadcaster's new sign-off forces a tactical shift from teaching to listening. The cost of her prior, futile attempts is felt, and the new method narrows her options productively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory resisting oppression emerges organically from the specific events of listening to dust. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the air itself remembering how to speak. This conceptual repricing reweights the entire premise without moralizing, arising from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's professional, meticulous perception. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the climax of listening to the dust. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the voice is singular and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("a tiny, defiant sun," "thistled calm") is precise, purposeful, and consistent. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs, especially in the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise—teaching dust to tell stories—is strikingly original and fully committed to. It synthesizes a dystopian setting, a musical profession, and a metaphysical concept into a singular, inevitable whole. The specific, grounded choices in character and world logic transform potential tropes into a fresh, authentic vision.</comment>
