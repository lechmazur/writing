<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling his investigation. His final choice to integrate the arrowhead's story is earned through prior causality with visible cost—the absorption of its violent history. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently strong, as seen when he feels the pulse "through the soles of his worn boots." The final endurance is a credible renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks (bird flock kink) and a decisive cadence shift at closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Kaelen holds "both truths at once," reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is tight; the arrowhead's discovery directly leads to the final integration. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The Towers of Bone and canyon are tactile and pressure-filled, as seen when the pulse vibrates "through the soles of his worn boots." The arrowhead functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the bird flock's break serving as a meaningful pattern shift that reweights the stake. The cost is legible when the arrowhead's energy is absorbed, imposing a violent history onto Kaelen. Pressure coheres and tightens, narrowing his options from appraisal to integration. The dominant stake (harmony vs. discord) is signaled early and tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of integration, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of eternal hum and linear conflict, culminating in the final image of holding "both truths." Subtext operates powerfully in the arrowhead as a "desperate cry from a lost time." Complexity is embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in the lyrical, measured prose. Diction remains within Kaelen's plausible lexicon, even under pressure. The narrative stance is consistent and effective, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression is used without sacrificing clarity, and the voice is singular and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs, such as "a tiny, sharp testament to a world of conflict." Minor artifact: a slight register elevation in "quiet, encompassing grace" feels mildly decorative but does not harm closure. Overall, clarity and concision are maintained with strong momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient reverence and violent history feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a "pulse left wandering" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The final reconfiguration is earned and bold, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The perspective is memorable and authentically singular.</comment>
