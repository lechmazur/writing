<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her "carefully reckless" approach embodies contradictory impulses. The final choice to share her discovery feels earned by her prior struggle and visible cost of isolation. Embodied emotion ("heart pound against her ribs") avoids diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of interconnected promises builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("tears welled in her eyes") and reconfigures her relationship to silence. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ink well constrains choice and charges the final image with "satisfied warmth." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional bias. The archive functions as micro-setting that pressures her choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under accumulative lens: each promise connection deepens stakes. Cost is legible in the near-empty ink well and emotional release. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the method of interconnected promises. Ending offers non-literal answer through "harmonic experience of pure understanding." Avoids moralizing; subtext operates in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with professional lexicon ("arcane linguist," "syntax"). POV stable; elision taught early through method. Minor thesaurus-churn ("mercurial fluid" → "captured galaxy") but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with strong propulsion. Minor register drift in peak beats ("droplet of captured galaxy") but doesn't harm clarity. No loops or scaffolding; rhythm supports accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic theory and mystical revelation. Core concept irreplaceable; method transforms familiar deciphering trope. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
