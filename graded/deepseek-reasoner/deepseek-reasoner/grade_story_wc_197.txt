<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly under stress ("familiar cold dread," "heart hammered against her ribs"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values, and her final choice to run and hide is a credible endurance of her motivation. The one minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic label in the opening paragraph ("her motivation was simple and fierce"), though this is quickly grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A strong hybrid drive lens (causal/accumulative) is held throughout. Closure is a clear Charged Poise, crystallizing her enduring commitment with visible cost (emerging from the filth, documents safe). The cost is legible on the page, and the persistent constraint of the Revision shapes all tactics. The puddle-map method is a motivated ellipsis that fits the accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional and actively constrains choice. The puddle provides the map, and the auric lagoon and phone booth are indispensable to the closure, charging the final image with profound thematic weight. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens. The dead-drop failure tightens options, forcing her to decode the puddle map. The patrol skiff introduces a final, lethal pressure point, and her choice to run along the lagoon (not away) is a tactical, agential move that narrows her path to survival with a clear, felt cost (hiding in the filth).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image—the phone booth key, the revised lagoon, the act of remembering. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of resistance through endurance. The final image of her as "the keeper of the map" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, resourceful narrative voice. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates effectively with tension. The single, very minor deduction is for a slight register elevation in the phrase "tyranny of indifference," though it is quickly grounded in character action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive. Figurative language is purposeful and vivid ("sun bled into dusk," "velvety black pierced by cold, sharp stars") without muddying clarity. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the narrative pace. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dystopian premise with a tactile, object-based resistance feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices—using a defunct phone booth, a chemical spill as a landmark—transform familiar tropes through lived detail and a non-obvious, ingenious method of communication.</comment>
