<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a tangible internal conflict between duty and preservation. Her micro-choices, like showing Hem the tablet and accepting the stone, reveal her values under pressure. The final resolve feels earned, though her internal contradiction could be slightly more dramatized in-scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens holds. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost felt in the weight of the stone and the final image of the mural. The causal chain of Lyra's actions leading to the community's adaptation is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft-city setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, constraining tactics and supplying key resources. The foundation stone chip is a masterful micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains a pivotal choice, elevating the score into the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving community spirit) is clear. Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency, with the pressure from OmniCorp and Hem's trust forcing a meaningful tactical shift. The cost of her role as a bridge is legible, though the corporate threat remains slightly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between corporate order and organic community. The final mural offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preservation through adaptation. The foundation stone becomes a powerful motif that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, textured rhythm. The narration's perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through Lyra's professional and emotional lens. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "aesthetic coherence and revenue streams," but it's character-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A few minor artifacts exist, such as the slightly cliché "weight like an anchor on her soul" and the near-paraphrase between "hopeful desperation" and "steady resolve," preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise of a Culture Shock Absorber using encoded graffiti is a fresh, ingenious synthesis. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The story commits fully to its concept and follows its implications with authenticity and specific, grounded detail.</comment>
