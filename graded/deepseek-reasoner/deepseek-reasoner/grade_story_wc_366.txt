<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elvan's characterization is strong, with his reticence and observational nature grounding his pivotal choice. His final decision to become the keeper is earned by his discovery and the ghost's lament, a credible endurance with felt cost. The only minor weakness is a slight telling of the ghost's motive ("a need to bottle the feeling of safety") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive change (Elvan assuming the keeper's role) with clear, felt cost in his transformed purpose. The discovery of the letters provides the necessary because/therefore linkage, making his choice inevitable. Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated and pressures choice. The "haunted lantern room" and "churning black cove" are not merely atmospheric but directly constrain Elvan's actions and charge the final image. The sea glass and cairns function as micro-settings that dictate tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elvan's agency under the causal lens. The stakes (a ship is due) are clear and tighten with each discovery. His choice to relight the lamp is a major turn that narrows options and carries the cost of a new, solitary life. Pressure coheres and builds to this point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship and silent companionship emerges organically from the particulars of the letters and Elvan's choice. The final image of him building a cairn offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's notes and the stacked stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elvan's taciturn, observant nature. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm that modulates with the eerie atmosphere. The ghost's "voice" in the letters is distinct yet period-appropriate, creating a clean separation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences are varied and rhythmic. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "a need to bottle the feeling of safety" leans slightly toward thematic statement, but it is a single instance and does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a reticent supplyman, a ghostly correspondence, and stone-cairn warnings feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking with a silent protagonist and a non-physical antagonist heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
