<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is concrete, embodied in her "aching" hands and the physical weight of silence, compelling her higher-stakes choice to build a welcome. Her "boldly sympathetic" nature is shown through specific observations, not told, and her final renunciation of revealing the artist is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara chooses to build a bridge instead of exposing the artist, a stance crystallization that forecloses a path with the felt cost of the community's unanswered hope. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density toward the final, charged image. A minor causality slip: the community's immediate shift from finding a tag to a gentle search feels slightly assumed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly specific and pressure choices, serving as the locus of community and Elara's final act. The marsh setting constrains her search and provides the reeds for her decisive artwork. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under the accumulative lens; her search deepens the stake of belonging, and her final decision to dedicate her art is a meaningful tightening that reweights the community's hope with the cost of her solitary labor. The dominant stake (to graft onto community) is signaled early and tested through her discovery and consequential choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of art, silence, and community, culminating in the non-literal, resonant answer of the collaborative glowing sculpture. The final image of the "grafted self" reweights the prior material without moralizing, offering a complex answer to the ache of connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical texture in word choice and rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is goal-driven and character-specific, serving as a decisive promise that advances the plot and reveals her stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deductions for a slight tendency toward thesaurus-churn in phrases like "luminescent ache" and "boldly sympathetic," which, while legible, introduce a hint of decorative language in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its post-apocalyptic, linguistic-loss premise with a deeply personal emotional arc in a fresh, non-obvious way. The specific, lived-in details of reed-sculpting and moss-painting feel authentic and indispensable to the narrative logic and closure. The risk of a quiet, communal resolution pays off.</comment>
