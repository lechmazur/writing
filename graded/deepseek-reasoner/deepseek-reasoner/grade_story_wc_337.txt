<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific, credible worldview. Her micro-choices under pressure (tracing the net, the final suturing) reveal her values. However, her internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized on the page, and her emotional state remains largely serene, lacking the embodied struggle that would push the score higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost: the spirit's dissolution into the now-light silence. The final image of the sutured mask reconfigures the meaning of restoration, providing a decisive, felt end to the spirit's story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism-lit sanctuary is a masterclass in micro-setting. It is not just described but is an active, constraining entity—the "interlaced hush" and "accumulated silence" are tangible forces that pressure the characters and charge the final, serene image. The starlight and prism beams are filtered through the POV to create a cohesive, atmospheric crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift: the spirit's materialization. This reweights the dominant stake, transforming the work from a solitary task into a "dialogue with the dead." The cost is legible in the final, reconfigured silence. A near-perfect escalation for the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of healing through acknowledgment, not concealment, is fully integrated and emerges from the core action of suturing the mask. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the prior material without a hint of moralizing. The subtext in the "sympathetic magic" is profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, precise texture that modulates perfectly with the solemn tone. The prose as character is exceptional; syntax and perception reflect Elara's focused, ritualistic mindset. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "The air... held an interlaced hush, a silence woven from the breath of the dead and the focused quiet of the living" do multiple jobs without padding. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle to detract from the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration, sympathetic magic via net-unraveling, and a spectral sanctuary feels organic and fresh. The core concept is executed with high authenticity of vision, transforming familiar ghost-lore tropes through specific, grounded choices in character, method, and setting. A specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
