<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is exceptional, with deeply embodied trauma (somatic markers, freezing) and a credible, earned shift from terror to a hard-won stasis. Her motivation ("to anchor optimism in realism") is dramatized through her actions in the garden and the final re-pricing of the photograph, not merely stated. The final endurance is earned by the causality of her using the grandmother's advice and the tactile anchor of the pine bark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost: the re-pricing of the photograph from a "cruel joke" to "evidence" is a decisive conceptual change. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift into the flashback, resolved by a return to the present with reweighted meaning. The cost of her endured terror is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the closure. The arboretum's wind-sculpted pines mirror her endurance; the specific pine bark serves as the somatic anchor that pulls her back to the present. Sensory details (salt scent, wave sounds) are filtered through her trauma and recovery, making the environment a crucial actor in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is intense and driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the jet's drone triggers a somatic, involuntary reaction, forcing her to employ her grandmother's taught method to regain agency. The stakes (internal equilibrium vs. traumatic dissolution) are visceral and the cost of the panic attack is deeply felt. A single, powerful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the integration of character, setting, and action. The central question of finding growth amidst fragility is answered not with facile optimism but with the "sturdier" proof of the photograph and the act of "planting." The final image is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature attuned to somatic experience and environmental pressure. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the panic attack and its resolution. The lyrical compression of the ending ("The light was gone, but she was still here, planting.") is taught and pays off perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong information density and purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight rhythmic stumble in the list "heat and the dust and the screaming" which slightly softens the peak of the flashback. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone strike survivor's PTSD with the metaphor of tending a wind-sculpted garden is original, specific, and feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with integrity, avoiding cliché. The use of somatic markers as a plot mechanism is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes.</comment>
