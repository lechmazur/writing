<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kalanu's frugality and empirical nature are consistently embodied and drive his initial motivation and final choice. His internal contradiction—logic versus arcane power—plays out in real time during the climax. The final choice to accept guardianship is a profound, earned renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing his path of pure observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and holds: each action triggers a consequence. The inciting incident (finding the tile) and climax (deciphering it) are tightly linked. Closure is a decisive change (becoming a warden) with a profound, on-page cost ("a solemn secret," "a burden"). Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The palace setting is a crucible that pressures choice and charges the final image. The "dusky harmony" and "long shadows" are not just atmosphere but reflect the fragile, transitional state of power. The magic square tile is a micro-setting that constrains every action in the climax, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset (sealing a covenant) and escalate coherently under the causal lens. The priestess's opposition creates immediate, tangible pressure. The protagonist's agency—choosing to calculate instead of pray—drives the decisive turn and forces a trade-off with a heavy, legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of logic versus devotion emerges entirely through action and image, culminating in the brilliant conceptual repricing of "encrypted devotion" as a key, not a plea. The final image of the tile as a "solemn secret" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the POV of a precise astronomer. The perceptual signature is unique ("dusky harmony," "frugal nature"). Elision is purposeful, and the prose rhythm modulates expertly with the rising pressure of the confrontation. Dialogue is sharp and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, especially in the climax ("a lattice, a cage").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy and Babylonian myth feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept—using math to decipher a divine covenant—is a non-obvious, ingenious angle that is fully committed to and followed through to its logical, satisfying conclusion. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
