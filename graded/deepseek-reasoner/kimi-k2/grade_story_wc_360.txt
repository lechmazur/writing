<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The operator's motivation to "solve emotion like an equation" is clear and intensifies, compelling her to reverse the process when she realizes its hollowness. Her micro-choices under pressure, like setting the cracked halo into the chase, reveal a hierarchy of values with a visible cost. The borrowed personality provides a compelling internal contradiction, though its dissolution at the end feels slightly more summarized than fully dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens dominates, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift as the stars vanish and the transposition leaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she internalizes the final theorem, with cost legible in the cracked halo and ashen prints. The pattern of emotional mathematics is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The workshop's tilting and the stars' sequential blinking apply coherent pressure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's urgent, mathematical perception of the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the leaking transposition and vanishing stars accelerate the crisis. The protagonist's agency in reversing the press is a major tightening choice that narrows options and carries a clear cost—the dissolution of the borrowed personality and the destruction of the prints. The dominant stake of understanding emotion is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of empathy's cost and the mathematics of emotion is fully integrated, emerging from events and the central concept of transposition. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("become the distance") that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image of the halo mapping "the precise location where understanding begins" is a masterful thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, controlled lyrical and mathematical voice that modulates under pressure. Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("lucid turbulence") are taught and paid off. The astronomer's whispered line is a clean, voice-motivated deviation that deepens the moment without breaking legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the density of figurative language (e.g., "like a sigh compressed into numbers"), but it remains coherent and voice-motivated, never obscuring causality or the closure image. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of transposing empathy as a typeset equation is brilliantly original and organic. The synthesis of celestial mechanics, printing, and emotion feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, metaphysical style heightens stakes and coherence without becoming gimmicky. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
