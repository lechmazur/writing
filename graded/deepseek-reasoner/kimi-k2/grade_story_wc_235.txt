<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction acts simultaneously in scene ("jealousy flared, hot and ridiculous"), embodied emotion ("tasting tannin and snow"), and micro-choices under pressure (stepping off the planks) are all executed with mastery. The final choice to write is earned by the vision's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (the scroll's consumption, the scent of smoke/sap). The pattern of scattered selves deepens to a decisive, cost-bearing realization that reconfigures her stance toward chaos and time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cabin and scroll are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("wind scraped pine needles," "air tasted of iron and pine sap"). The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens (blood on bark, choice to soar). A single, meaningful cadence shift (the flight) reweights the dominant stake of self-acceptance with undeniable cost (the scroll's destruction).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of time and self through the image of the fresh scroll. Theme emerges organically from event and image, resisting tidy morals and embracing the "truest narrative" of chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional ("wind scraped pine needles across the tin roof like a warning"). POV is stable and apt; purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. Voice is singular and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion ("Ash spiraled upward, each flake a word she had hoarded"). Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of time, self, and narrative feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular detail and emotional specificity.</comment>
