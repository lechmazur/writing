<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her hands, furiously tranquil"). The final choice to project the poem is earned by prior causality of understanding the "cartography of scars," with visible cost in the alignment of scars on paper and palm. The poet's motivation intensifies under pressure from a need to understand to a need to broadcast, compelling the high-stakes climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a powerful Conceptual Repricing: scars are redefined as roads, not just wounds. The cost is legible in the final image of people reading "their own scars in the sky." Orientation is immediate and the pattern of accumulating images (timer, envelope, scars) pays off decisively at closure, reweighting the premise of censorship with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting is no mere backdrop; it actively pressures choices and supplies the crucial resource of the storm and telescope for the climax. The dome, stormlight, and telescope all constrain and enable the protagonist's actions, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action and thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from private development to public projection. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the final act. The dominant stake (freeing censored words) tightens through a cadence shift from internal revelation to external action, forcing a trade-off that forecloses the path of private keeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The theme of censorship and resilience emerges entirely through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("every wound is a door the sky learns to open") that reweights the prior material of scars and roads without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly in the final projection onto the storm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, potent perceptual signature ("wind rearranged constellations into new alphabets"). The lyrical, compressed diction is consistent, voice-motivated, and its pattern is taught early and paid off at closure. The prose as character perfectly reflects the poet's furiously tranquil state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, accelerating the thematic pressure. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful, particularly in the climax ("Lightning completed the circuit; the poem projected itself...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, potent synthesis of political censorship, poetic resilience, and alchemical development. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven. The specific, verifiable detail (bus timetable, darkroom process) creates authenticity. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
