<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied perception ("acoustically perceptive") driving micro-choices. The final renunciation (not playing, but conducting) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the empty case and single shoot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence fractures into possibility. Cost is legible in the final image of the empty case and the single green shoot. Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, serving the deliberate atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are not backdrop but the very instrument of the story's transformation, integrated into every beat with vivid, purposeful sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; the stake (to find beauty/complete the unfinished) deepens through her choice to speak, not play. The cost is felt in her unbound hair and the light, empty case, a trade-off that reweights the final possibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished emerges entirely through event and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final realization ("not something to be found but something that found you") avoids moralizing, growing organically from the specific, charged particulars of the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by acoustic sensitivity. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and paid off at closure, maintaining legibility and coherence under peak pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. There are no loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats to obscure the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original, non-obvious synthesis of concepts (violinist, shipwrecks, chronic hush) feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking—centering a story on unbinding silence without music—heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
