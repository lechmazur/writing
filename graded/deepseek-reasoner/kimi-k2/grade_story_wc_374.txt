<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's shift from skeptic to luminous is earned through concrete micro-choices like pressing the ring to her tongue and accepting convergence. Contradictory impulses (doubt/curiosity) act simultaneously. Final choice to merge climates carries visible cost as the ring dissolves into Mara's veins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of weather imagery tightens toward convergence. Closure is resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost felt at "ring dissolve" and "tolerable season." Orientation is clear within 120 words; linkage through taste and compass motion is consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora constrain choice by drawing protagonist toward edge where Mara appears. Tin ring functions as micro-setting, charging the final image through dissolution. Sensory details (ozone, cardamom, lavender-salt) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to preventing valley's drowning through Mara's revelation. Protagonist's agency drives convergence choice under accumulative pressure. Cost is legible in ring's dissolution and "tolerable season" phrasing, foreclosing solitary skepticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared emotional weather emerges through particulars like "root ballots" and "obsolete star charts." No moralizing; final image of "ordinary stars" reweights prior grandeur with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in taste metaphors and compass kinship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("tasting the wind"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off. Dialogue ("May our atmospheres converge") carries subtext and advances plot. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density. Minor figurative overload in "freckled fish" constellation slightly muddles peak beat. No loops or scaffolding; rhythm supports accumulative momentum. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weather magic and electoral metaphor feels inevitable. Risk-taking in taste-based navigation heightens stakes. Specificity (tin compass ring, aurora) avoids tropiness. Transformation of skepticism through visceral convergence is fresh.</comment>
