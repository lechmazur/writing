<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like pressing her forehead to the soil to whisper the name of a peach. Her motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. A credible endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost felt as her voice cracks and memories scatter. The final choice to release the tapestry is an earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is legible on the page: "felt her memories scatter again, lighter now, seeds on new wind." The pattern of memory accumulation pays off decisively, reconfiguring the stakes from personal salvation to communal legacy without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is not just vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The mica window, the orchard's pulsing bark, and the soil all pressure the protagonist's tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her expertise and urgency, such as the air tasting of "iron and lullabies." The environment evolves causally with her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening act of binding memories. The cost is unmistakable: "voice cracking, because the realm was not yet saved, only reminded." A single meaningful intensification—the night pushing back and unraveling her song—effectively tightens pressure and raises the stakes to their peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and loss. The final image of a child remembering her name through a peach is a profound conceptual repricing that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the act of swaddling feeling like "bound release."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with a consistent, lyrical texture. Purposeful compression and elision ("air tasted of iron and lullabies") are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the keeper's specific lexicon and worldview, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("sorrow and joy braided so tightly they became the same thread" borders on therapy-speak). However, rhythm is masterful and figurative language is largely coherent and purposeful, never obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of memory, light, and community feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "woven dawns" is transformed through grounded, lived detail. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains powerfully legible. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance.</comment>
