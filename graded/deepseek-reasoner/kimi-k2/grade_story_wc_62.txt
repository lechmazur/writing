<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, compelling her higher-stakes choice to carve. Her interiority is concrete and particular, especially in the final choice to trade poems with the living and dead. The final renunciation of grief as a monument is earned by the spectral mentorship and her own work. A slight deduction for the "fiercely meditative" trait, which feels more told than fully embodied in her on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through density of imagery and a cadence shift at closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is legible and potent, reconfiguring Mara's understanding of grief with undeniable cost felt in the village's tears. The linkage from mentorship to carving to the final image is seamless and taught. The persistent constraint of the ribbon and the migration's timeframe shape tactics and the final, cost-laden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is indispensable, pressuring choices by containing the ritual and supplying the granite and pollen that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities. The environment evolves causally with the events, from the initial calm to the thundering pollen drift. The recurring object (the ribbon) constrains choice and decisively charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her decision to retrace the flight paths with her chisel deepens the stakes and forces a trade-off of time and effort. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the weeks of work and the final, tearful reaction of the villagers. A single, meaningful intensification—from seeking understanding to creating a vessel for release—is perfectly sufficient for this length and executed with high coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a dynamic, migratory force emerges organically from the concrete particulars of carving, butterflies, and the ribbon. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the carved line and the villagers' tears, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The final whispered stanza avoids thematic echo, instead letting the image carry the meaning. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly in the silent communication of the spectral mentor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains controlled and consistent under emotional pressure. Diction and syntax are meticulously crafted to reflect Mara's thoughtful, tactile worldview. The spectral dialogue is economical and goal-driven, carrying immense subtext. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the weeks of work) are taught and paid off at closure, enhancing rather than obscuring legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with scene needs. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled, even in peak beats like the pollen drift. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. The final line is a masterful resolution that recharges prior motifs with impeccable clarity and concision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion without retreat. The story's singular artistic stance avoids any echo of template plots or famous lines. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
