<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("ache under her ribs"). Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling high-stakes choices. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic summary ("grief is a compass...") that abstracts a peak emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost on the page ("the wire cutting into her hands, the bronze searing"). The final image reconfigures meaning and stakes with perfect coherence to the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional integration. The setting (signal station, dish) and object (censer foot) are not merely described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully filtered through the POV's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a clear, meaningful cadence shift into the final act. The cost is legible on the page. A minor deduction for a slight easing of pressure in the middle beats before the final command "Navigate."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss and memory. The final image of "raw solace" perfectly reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and strong rhythmic control. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. A minor deduction for occasional over-written phrasing that slightly disrupts the voice's consistency under peak pressure (e.g., "geography of loss is a map...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and generally clear propulsion. A minor deduction for a few instances of figurative language that slightly muddles clarity in high-pressure beats (e.g., "river that had forgotten its name"). The closure beat, however, is executed with masterful clarity and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of elements feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of reverse migration is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
