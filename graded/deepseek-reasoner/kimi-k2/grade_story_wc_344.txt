<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (e.g., picking her father's lock of grief). Her final choice to become the lock is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt as her key fuses to her skin. Contradictory impulses are shown in the hall of mirrors, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the locksmith becomes the mechanism. Cost is legible: "felt her joints click into the grand mechanism." Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the pattern of prophecy and repair pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vividly specific and constrain choices (e.g., mirrors leaking daylight force action). The gear assortment and key are tactile objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: the locksmith's actions (uncapping vial, pressing gear) tighten options. Cost is visible in the world stuttering and her final transformation. One meaningful deepening (prophecy rhythm) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of repair and sacrifice emerges through concrete images (e.g., "locksmith becomes the lock") without moralizing. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in implication, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("breath became pale ghosts"). Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., prophecy fragments) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density. Minor overwriting in the hall of mirrors description ("drowning in sunlight" slightly strains coherence) but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of locksmith, eclipse mechanics, and time repair feels inevitable. Core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices (e.g., gear from a god's tear). Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
