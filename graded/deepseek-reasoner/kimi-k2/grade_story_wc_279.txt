<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Character's internal contradiction is vividly embodied through trembling fingers and silent laughter, with micro-choices (widening mandala, pressing palm) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolved silhouettes. Social perceptivity is demonstrated through quivering antennae and nod of gratitude, not just labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly: pattern density increases through chalk lines and mist transformations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence becomes a shared rhythm. Cost is legible in the "bruise-purple" mist and released silhouettes. Orientation is immediate with concrete sensory anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices through its breath and hush, while the tile flake and chalk charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (lilac mist, vibrating flake) and integrated into action. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: each chalk line intensifies the pattern density, forcing stance crystallization about unlearning as permission. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolved memories and "bruise-purple" unease. Dominant stake (discovering meaning) tightens through tactile engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars (sand staining lavender, tile pulse) rather than statement. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer about meaning in vanishing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and silence, particularly the flake's recounted promise that "sounded like relief."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent lyrical compression ("unlearning," "emergent hush"). POV remains stable and deeply filtered through artist's consciousness. Non-standard punctuation and syntax serve voice motivation. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats but maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional rhythmic control and information density, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "petals opening outward" containing memories). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("hush gather like an audience") but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of spiritual practice (mandala) with speculative elements (whispering gallery tile). Risk-taking in abstract concept ("unlearning") grounded through specific sensory details. Premise fully committed with conceptual integrity. Fresh inflection in the final urban mandala scene.</comment>
