<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (refusing then accepting the bargain) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final choice to trade memories is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the hollow absence felt after the exchange. Her "quietly determined" trait constrains actions credibly, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (memory transformed, not lost) with clear cost on the page ("a hollow where laughter had been"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with sensory density increasing toward the crystallized final image. The silk's offer and the crystal's use create coherent linkage without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet and mine shafts pressure choices and supply resources (azure crystal) that directly affect the outcome. The floating arches and azure sky recur with charged meaning, constraining tactics and mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the silk's repeated offers tightening pressure until Elowen's deliberate choice. The cost is unmistakable ("hollow where laughter had been") and alters later tactics. One meaningful deepening (the memory transformation) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of memory and grief into resilience, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of bartered awakenings is fully integrated into events and character choices, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through Elowen's grief and determination. Diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs ("shadows striping the apple-red soil like bruises") is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bartered memories, azure crystal, and ecological repair feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
