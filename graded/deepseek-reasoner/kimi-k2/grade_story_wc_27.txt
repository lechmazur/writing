<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("toes curling against the cold ferrocrete"). The final choice to transmit coordinates is earned by prior causality of the stone circle's revelation. The "awkwardly confident" trait subtly constrains movement ("elbows swing too wide"), though it could be more deeply integrated into pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing via the stone circle's transmission, reweighting the rebellion's premise with legible cost (the character's renewed commitment). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (the hum rising) escalating to a cadence shift that reweights stakes. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (the gantry groans under weight) and charging the final image (the control tower lights flickering). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("drip of coolant," "air thickened"). The spaceport and stone circle are seamlessly integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to place the opera glasses in the stone triggers the revelation. Cost is legible in her renewed commitment to "carry the note." The dominant stake (discovering meaning) tightens through sensory intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stone circle's revelation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about "keeping the song alive." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication (the stones as transmitters, not relics).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("thunderous serenity") and rhythmic control. Some register drift occurs in peak beats ("subsonic tremor that traveled through the gantry"), slightly elevating diction beyond the POV's lexicon, but the pattern is consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid with strong information density. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats ("tasted of copper and ozone," "stars blurred into silver smears") creates slight density without obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements that feels inevitable in hindsight. The stone circle as a transmitter is a transformed trope. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the universal theme.</comment>
