<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei-Ling's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied memory; her spiritual curiosity drives every action. Micro-choices, like breathing with the jasmine and lifting the tear to her lips, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final integration is earned by prior causality, with the cost of releasing sorrow made visible. Contradictory impulses of seeking and healing act simultaneously in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held, with pressure escalating through sensory density and pattern breaks (e.g., the tear's pulse syncing with memory). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as past and present selves occupy the same breath, reconfigured with the cost of released sorrow and mended fractures. The final image of the river carrying stars is a Conceptual Repricing of unused love.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The viaduct and jasmine are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and charge choices, with the blossoms dilating in response to her breath. The camera obscura functions as a micro-setting, its ground-glass screen the conduit for the pivotal vision. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through Mei-Ling's artistic, spiritual POV, building to a final image where setting and theme fuse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift driven by protagonist agency: her breath across the tear dissolves it, forcing a deepening that changes knowledge and floods her with love. The dominant stake (finding unused love) is tested and reweighted, with the cost of released sorrow legible on the page. The pressure coheres through a single, decisive intensification perfectly scaled to the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of the pilgrim's empty bowl, which is reweighted at closure to signify love's infinitude. The final, non-literal answer—that healing is "revelation"—arises from concrete particulars (the tear mist, the jasmine sparks) without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the warmth flaring "not burning but mending."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through a camera obscura artist's sensibility. The prose's lyrical, rhythmic control is exceptional and modulates with emotional intensity ("stitching the visible to the invisible"). Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the nun's gift) are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., breath fogging the lens reveals the "hidden lattice of light"). A minor figurative density appears in the climax ("liquid light, pooling in the cracked bowl of her chest") but is pattern-taught and serves closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm is masterfully controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera obscura artistry, past life memory, and Buddhist iconography is wholly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of a "pilgrim of sparks" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes and coherence, with the closure effect remaining perfectly legible.</comment>
