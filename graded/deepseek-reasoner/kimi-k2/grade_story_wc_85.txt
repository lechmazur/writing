<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, with embodied contradiction ("silence had grown inside her, branching into every false memory") and micro-choices under pressure (digging for the tin box). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she writes her real name and releases the paper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with felt cost: her choice to "choose voice" reconfigures her relationship to truth. Orientation is immediate; the watch hand's discovery tightens options naturally. The final image of the paper boat carries conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara's perception ("dusk pressing cobalt against her shoulders"). The watch hand functions as micro-setting, evolving in meaning across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (weight of withheld truth). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens: discovering the watch hand forces a deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible when she acknowledges her silence was a choice, not necessity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action ("time was a ribbon you could gather or let trail"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the paper boat carrying truth. No moralizing; complexity remains in the cost of her choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a strong perceptual signature ("sieved hush"). Voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression ("dusk had thinned to a violet line") serves emotional beats. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with minimal artifacts. Figurative language serves pressure ("silence had grown inside her, branching"). One minor paraphrase loop ("weight of unspoken words"/"weight of a withheld truth") but doesn't harm closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogy and memory with specific, grounded choices. The watch hand as object and metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off at closure. No template echoes or generic hedging.</comment>
