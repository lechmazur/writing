<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost's synesthetically blessed perception and encore-seeking motive are embodied through concrete, contradictory impulses (rehearsing a bow she never received, fingers the tarot coin). Her final choice to dance and gather echoes feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost as she dissolves into stage dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ghost dissolves into motes carrying future seeds, with cost legible in the "minor, tinged with loss" chord and her form loosening. The timeline's fracture and repair through echoes is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden and hedge maze actively constrain and enable the ghost's actions, charging the final image. The oldest tree with its lightning cleft and embedded objects directly shapes the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her synesthetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency under the Accumulative lens: she exhales to spin the wheel, follows it, presses the coin into the tree, and dances to gather echoes. The cost is unmistakable as the timeline collapses and she must sacrifice her form to knit it tight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ghost's struggle with time and memory, resisting tidy resolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the hush before the overture—that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image of the coin humming with nostalgia supports complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("petals drifting through her translucent ribs," scents that "hum a chord"). The voice is consistently poetic and synesthetically charged, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "scattering years as it goes" might slightly obscure causality), but clarity is maintained at closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of ghost story, time fracture, and synesthesia that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in lyrical density and non-linear structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
