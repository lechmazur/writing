<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's grief is embodied through specific objects and actions, with micro-choices under pressure (folding cranes as refusal to forget). The final transformation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the satchel's lightened weight. Contradictory impulses of trapping light/releasing grief act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of folding intensifies toward closure. On-page closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt at "weight in her satchel lessen." The paradox "descends while ascending" shapes tactics and final image. Orientation is clear by line 6.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass basilica and floating island constrain choice through inverse gravity and dream recording function. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered (e.g., "spires catching starlight"). The environment charges the final image as the island sinks while ascending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under Accumulative lens: each fold intensifies stakes until the moonstone cracks. Cost is legible in the satchel's lightened weight and the crane's return. Dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens through rhythmic folding action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (folding cranes) and reweighted image (constellation). The ending offers a non-literal answer to grief through the hopeful sketch. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like the sister's love of origami.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical yet precise diction ("burnt paper curling from flame"). POV is stable and voice-motivated. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure. Elision (e.g., plague ships) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "luminous torment"). Minor artifact: "descends while ascending" repeats three times, but serves structural purpose. Rhythm accelerates during folding sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief work through magical realism. The "descends while ascending" paradox is transformed into narrative structure. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
