<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Octavia's characterization is precise and deeply integrated with her actions. Her "devotedly observant" trait compels her to use mathematical proof as her weapon, and her final choice to discard the nib feels earned by prior causality. The emotional cost is legible in her moist eyes and feeling "oddly light," avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image of smaller confessions rewriting themselves reweights the entire premise of regret. Causality is airtight, with the journalist's call providing initial pressure and Octavia's proof driving the decisive change. The cost is felt in the image of "cheeks remembering confession."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory is not just a setting but a vital crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. Its "vaulted stone throat" and the dome that cups laughter like a bell are purpose-driven, tactile details. The environment is fully integrated into the action, with the telescope's motion and the changing light of dawn actively shaping the narrative's mood and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Octavia's agency under the Accumulative lens, building through the density of her observations and calculations. The dominant stake—freeing herself from her father's orbit—tightens meaningfully with the discovery of the satellite and is resolved with a visible cost. The pressure remains coherent and culminates in the elegant violence of her proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of newsprint, orbits, and mathematical proof, resisting any tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of regret, acknowledging its potential to fragment rather than vanish. The final image of the "meteorite kiss" is a profound conceptual repricing that avoids sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that mirrors Octavia's character. Syntax and rhythm are controlled even under pressure, though a single moment of potential register drift ("magnesium heartburn") prevents a perfect score. POV is stable and deeply filtered through her unique worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with tremendous information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a potential mixed metaphor in "planetary rings of lies" (celestial/nautical) and the slightly ornate "magnesium heartburn." However, these are hairline slips that do not obscure clarity or momentum, and the closure beat is flawlessly executed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a newsprint heiress, orbital mechanics, and mathematical proof as a means of emotional intervention is brilliantly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with astonishing specificity, transforming familiar themes of legacy and regret into a singular, unforgettable artistic stance.</comment>
