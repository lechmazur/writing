<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (polishing the glass, approaching the pearl) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to share light without fire—is clear and intensifies credibly. The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost in the lifted weight and shared sky. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on memory to anchor motivation, though it remains character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the village's unlit wicks and Lira's lifted weight. The lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks (glass thinning, pearl exhaling) reweighting the stake. Orientation is immediate; who, where, and when are anchored by line 2. The pearl's mechanics are slightly ambiguous but do not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposefully selective, with the grotto and tide pools acting as a micro-setting that pressures Lira's choice of basin. However, it does not fully constrain tactics—the choice of location is intuitive rather than forced by environmental logic. The serpentine path and mist are evocative but slightly ornamental. Strong sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens: her polishing thins the glass, deepening its capacity to carry light and raising the stakes of its use. The cost is legible in the pearl's dissolution of the glass and the resulting exhaled light that spares the wicks. One meaningful tightening (the polishing ritual) is sufficient for this length, and it foreshadows the closure effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of memory, light, and stillness, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to sharing light without destruction ("they simply learned how to stay"). Subtext operates in image and implication, such as the sea glass holding "the entire night sky compressed." The final reconfiguration charges prior material without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("mist coiling into the shape of forgotten lullabies"). Diction remains within Lira's lexicon, and syntax modulates with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. No head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., the pearl's exact nature) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence openings. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "reflectively vibrant with the green of auroras she had never seen" could be tighter). A slight mixed metaphor ("heart of light beating without burning") slightly muddles clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of star-watching, sea glass, and a pearl of stillness feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image is bold and singular, avoiding template plots or derivative premises.</comment>
