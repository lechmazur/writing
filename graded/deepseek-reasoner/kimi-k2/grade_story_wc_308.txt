<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices; final transformation earned through embodied accumulation of memory and dust. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing. The Earned Stasis closure lands with visible cost as she becomes a tower of bone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost in the physical transformation. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The pattern of memory and dust accumulation drives toward inevitable stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Towers of bone and canyon of echoes function as active elements that teach and transform. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in her physical crystallization. Dominant stake (learning navigation through stillness) tightens meaningfully through pattern recognition. Pressure coheres through increasing density of memory and dust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image patterns; ending offers resonant non-literal answer to central question of navigation through accumulation. No moralizing; complexity embraced through the transformation paradox. The final image reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with exceptional rhythmic control; POV stable and voice-consistent. Purposeful compression and patterned elision serve accumulative design. Diction remains within character's lexicon despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language pattern-taught and paid off at closure. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor clusters in middle beats, though coherence maintained. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of familiar concepts (memory, time, transformation) through specific, grounded execution. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
