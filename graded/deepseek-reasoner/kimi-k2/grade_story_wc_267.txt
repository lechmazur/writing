<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop's characterization is exceptional, with embodied numbness ("fingertips still numb") and a micro-choice to investigate the bolt revealing his core motivation. His final decision to leave is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the collapsing fortress. Interiority remains concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost: the fortress cracks open, releasing swallowed screams. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory details (discoloration, bolt's whisper) until the final choice reweights everything. One meaningful tightening (the bolt's discovery) escalates cleanly to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress is indispensable, constraining choices (silence covenant, staircase wear) and charging the final image (walls cracking). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("walls the color of winter dusk," "snow that tasted of salt and old songs"). The environment is fully integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the bolt's discovery forces a choice that narrows options. The dominant stake (safety vs. memory) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the fortress's collapse and the released screams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>The theme (cost of safety is forgetting) emerges through events and images (swallowed screams, hollow guardians) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the burning white light and upward-falling snow. Subtext operates powerfully in implication and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters detail through the bellhop's numbness and duty ("clinking like a distant, reluctant tongue"). Diction remains within his plausible lexicon. The voice is coherent and purposefully compressed, with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("seraphically mundane," "like a dropped star"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on safety and memory. The combination of elements (silent bellhop, sentient fortress, nerve regeneration) feels organic and singular. Risk-taking in the lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
