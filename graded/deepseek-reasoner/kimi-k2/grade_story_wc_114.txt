<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional with embodied contradictions: the oracle's fault-tolerance manifests as accepting revision, while Elias's silent data-logging reveals his complicity. Their micro-choices (smudging the glacier, writing in the logbook) are earned by prior causality. The final endurance of silence's weight carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of "sorrow" and "smudging" intensifies to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence's weight is measured and hope becomes quantifiable. Cost is legible at the scale's 4.7-gram settlement and the expanding walls. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The weather station is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice (the tower ladder, the scale) and charges the final image (honest, smudged gray peaks). Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through professional POV (anemometer, barometer, radiosondes). The gentian illustration evolves from carried object to measured truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the shared act of smudging the glacier's outline is a decisive deepening that reweights the dominant stake (the weight of silence). The cost is unmistakable in the glacial shard scraping Elias and the needle settling on 4.7 grams.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image (gentian, glacier), action (smudging, weighing), and concept (fault-tolerance). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the glacier is gone but the gentian remembers, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, lyrical syntax that modulates with emotional intensity ("auroral sorrow," "slow questions"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the oracle's and Elias's professional and emotional lenses. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the swallowed thing) are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density. Minor figurative muddle in "auroral sorrow" appearing twice slightly dulls the pattern, and "fever breaks" is somewhat ornamental. Rhythm and sentence-level propulsion are masterful, and closure clarity is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of climate grief and personal accountability through the specific lens of a "fault-tolerant oracle." The concept of weighing silence feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the highly lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
