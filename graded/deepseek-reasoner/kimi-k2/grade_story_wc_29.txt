<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's characterization is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("palms sweated") and micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final choice to mirror the signal is earned by prior causality (mentor's warning, prior trickster games) with visible cost (overheated circuitry, personal risk). The trait "cautiously hopeful" is dramatized through action, not just labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the conflict reaches a precarious equilibrium, costing Lyra's effort and risk. The final image ("town no longer quite so eager to tear itself apart") reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the transmitter's overload and Lyra's slump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is intensely purposeful: the basement studio ("smelled of solder and ozone") and astronomical charts constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, reflecting Lyra's professional priorities. The transmitter's overheating circuitry creates tangible pressure that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Lyra's interference provokes the tricksters' counter-signal, forcing her to calculate a phase shift. Cost is unmistakable (dimming lights, copper smell, personal risk). The dominant stake (preventing communal violence) tightens meaningfully through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: the tension between signal and noise, manipulation and resilience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the comet's softened light and the town's drift toward curiosity. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the precarious balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical precision and poetic sensibility ("tasted like burnt sugar and regret"). Diction remains within Lyra's lexicon; syntax modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., exact equations) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even under pressure. Minor artifact: "silk oscillation" slightly elevates diction but is voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; closure image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and fully integrated: cosmic manipulation through subsonic frequencies, resisted with lullabies and heartbeats. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the high-concept premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, executed with specificity and emotional truth.</comment>
