<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity and engineering mindset are embodied through specific actions like tracing vectors and rerouting conduits. Her final choice to create a garden is a credible, earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "functionally creative" trait is shown, not told, though its specific trade-offs could be slightly more dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terminal is reconfigured from abandonment to possibility. The cost is legible in the on-page effort and the final image of the terminal breathing anew. The linkage from intention to action is seamless and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling Mara's choices. The cracked terrazzo, dry fountain, and dormant power conduits are not just described but are integral to the plot. The environment charges the final image, with the bioluminescent vines completing the transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from observation to active, physical intervention. The dominant stake (finding hope in loss) tightens meaningfully as Mara moves from aligning the sextant to rerouting flows. The cost is her all-night labor, culminating in a final, decisive act of rerouting the fountain pump.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of rerouting loss into possibility emerges organically from the specific actions of rerouting power and water. The final equation, "hope is a vector...," is a non-literal, earned answer that reweights the entire narrative. It avoids moralizing, instead landing as a conceptual repricing of abandonment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's engineer's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "equations for hope," "geometry of abandonment"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and legible, sustaining a consistent tone of "stoic wonder" that modulates perfectly with the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a maze of intentions: boarding corridors branching...") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks clarity. However, it never obscures causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a civil engineer in an abandoned carnival spaceport is fresh and non-obvious. The core concept of the terminal as a "sextant" measuring angles of desire is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
