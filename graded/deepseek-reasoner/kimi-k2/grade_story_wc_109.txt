<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotion and micro-choices reveal character through tactile interaction with the booklet and environment. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the star extinguishes. Mildly obsessed trait could be more actively constraining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the map's glow reweighting the premise of endless night. Orientation is immediate; causality remains intact through patterned escalation of silences. The final dot's transformation provides undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices (parapet edge, storm) and charges the final image (altar). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. The fort's stones and ambered hush become tactile participants in the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating silences under Accumulative lens; protagonist agency drives each summarization. Cost is legible when the star obeys her command and darkness falls. The final map's creation forecloses other paths with visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the map-making action; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to enduring silence. Subtext operates through imagery (gold flakes, star extinction) without moralizing. The conceptual repricing at closure deepens all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptually signature voice; syntax reflects the oracle's obsessive focus. Purposeful compression (e.g., "She summarized it with a single horizontal line") serves the accumulative design. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet precise with strong rhythmic control; figurative language consistently serves the theme. Minor overwriting in phrases like "marbled hush—thick, veined, almost sculptural" creates slight density but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of cartography and silence; concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off in closure. Specificity of detail (gold flakes, cedar scent) avoids generic abstraction. Transforms the oracle trope through grounded particularity.</comment>
