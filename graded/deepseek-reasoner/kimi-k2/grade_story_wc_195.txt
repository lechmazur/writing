<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calen's withdrawn nature and forgotten vow are consistent, embodied through trembling fingers and shivering bliss. His micro-choice to unsnap the puppet's gorget mirrors his own desertion, earning the final merging. The emotional progression from withdrawn exile to integrated purpose feels credible, though the peak transformation is slightly swift for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases through recurring images (allegiance, unsnapping, silver sap) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost: "gravity loosening like a slackened string" and the knight stepping into branching dawns. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse actively constrains choice: silver sap feeds runic roots that become harp strings, and the glass wall melts to reveal new dawns. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (cedar, greasepaint, lavender, thunderclouds). The setting is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative density: the murmured allegiance, puppet's activation, and silver cord braiding tighten pressure toward the inevitable merging. Cost is legible: "grafting possibility to sinew and bone" and the loss of solitary identity. Agency is clear in unsnapping the clasp and crossing the threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: performance as reality-repairing act, vows as choreography. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "branching dawns" shaped by carried choreography. Subtext operates in gestures (unsnapping) and objects (puppet's mirror face).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature favoring mystical-mechanical imagery ("factually mystical depth," "geometry of regret"). Syntax modulates effectively under pressure, though minor density in peak beats ("petals of light peeling from the fruit to orbit the scene"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense but purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in phrases like "factually mystical depth" creates slight register drift. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Closure image remains clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of knightly and theatrical motifs feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with strong closure. Specificity in details (walnut joints, cedar and greasepaint) avoids generic fantasy. Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
