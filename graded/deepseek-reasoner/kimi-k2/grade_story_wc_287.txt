<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a "wistfully pragmatic" desire to reflect light. Her embodied emotion ("throat tightened with protected vulnerability") and micro-choices (humming, using the gauge) reveal character under pressure. The final endurance is earned, though the "wistfully pragmatic" trait is more stated than actively constraining choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the garden holds its "own glow," reconfiguring the stakes with a felt cost of vulnerability. The cost is legible in the image of "cupping a match flame in bare hands." Orientation is clear within the first 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fire escape and harbor are not just backdrop; they actively pressure and enable Mira's actions. The gauge tooth and rosebush function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift (the humming, the deepening hush) that reweights the dominant stake of preservation. The cost is the palpable vulnerability Mira feels. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, though the final turn is more a deepening than a tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of light, locks, and gardens, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving light in darkness. The final image of buds "tight as secrets" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm masterfully echoes the "rhythm of oars in water," modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. A minor paraphrase loop exists ("quivering hush" appears thrice), but it is pattern-taught and supports the accumulative design, causing no clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing and gardening is highly original and feels inevitable. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle, executed with full commitment to its implications. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
