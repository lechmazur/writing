<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and poetic, with embodied emotion ("volcanic tenderness trembling in her chest"). The final choice to become the archive's heartbeat is an Earned Stasis that forecloses her previous life with visible cost. The motivation to rescue the promise is clear and intensifies, though the trait "analytically intuitive" is more stated than demonstrated in active choice-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern and density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The final image of the arsonist becoming the archive's new heartbeat is a Charged Poise that reconfigures the stakes with undeniable cost. Causality is tight, with the glass key and tapestry reweaving serving as earned, pattern-taught turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ink distilled from her own burnt tears," "obsidian walls"). The environment evolves with the action and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (tapestry, key) is fully integrated into the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density of artistic creation, culminating in the chamber of mirrors—a decisive cadence shift. The dominant stake (rescue/remembering) is signaled early and deepens with visible cost (becoming the archive's heartbeat). Agency is demonstrated through her persistent, costly actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the promise and its cost, resisting moralizing. The final reconfiguration ("remembering why stories matter") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates powerfully in images like the phoenixes and the final tapestry. The piece avoids thematic statement, earning its wisdom through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent poetic-perceptual signature. The voice modulates with emotional intensity but remains coherent. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the fire's origin) are taught and paid off. Diction is controlled and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("volcanic tenderness trembling") slightly obscures immediacy but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with variation supporting emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of arson, library, and archive feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept (vandalized self-portrait) is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. The closure image is a bold, risk-taking choice that heightens stakes.</comment>
