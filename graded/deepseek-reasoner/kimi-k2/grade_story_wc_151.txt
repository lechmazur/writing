<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("refused the glass; she wanted fingerprints, smudges"). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("heart ticking faster"). The final choice to mail the letter and invent anew feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her unfamiliar smile and fractured reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building meaning through layered images. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of her fractured self, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost. The persistent constraint of her invented codes shapes tactics throughout. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The golden arcade is vividly rendered and actively pressures choice, its dawn light and marble floor constraining her movements and charging the final reflection. The ebony clipboard and chalk function as micro-settings, constraining her actions and reweighting meaning. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single meaningful cadence shift as she adds the final chalk symbol, reweighting the dominant stake of discovering meaning. The cost is legible in the "unfamiliar" smile and the act of surrender, foreclosing the path of this particular letter with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between digital erasure and tangible meaning, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image. The core concept of "surface mail" is fully integrated into the thematic question. The ending offers a complex answer through the charged poise of her fractured reflection, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("like a memory of tomorrow"). The prose has a distinct, controlled texture and rhythmic variation. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. One minor flaw: a potentially mixed metaphor in "the sound of childhood scraped across time" slightly risks clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of futuristic nostalgia, tangible correspondence, and private codes feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, resonant conclusion. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
