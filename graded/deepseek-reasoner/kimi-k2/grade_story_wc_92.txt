<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong with clear, consistent traits (vigilant, inventive, rebellious) and a well-established motivation that intensifies under pressure. The micro-choice to scratch the sigil reveals her values and agency. However, the motivation is slightly told ("motivation sharpening: to spark...") rather than fully dramatized in the moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; each action leads logically to the next, culminating in a decisive change (rebellion sparked) with clear cost (risk of discovery). The orientation is immediate and precise. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual and social cost felt in the final image of the murmuring city and the pamphlet's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot. The fort, blackout, and cradle of sparks are not just backdrop but actively constrain and enable choices. The bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial function as micro-settings that charge the final image and dictate tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, moving from observation to active sabotage. The dominant stake (overthrowing the Regent) is clear, and the cost of discovery is a live pressure throughout. The final release of the birds represents a meaningful, irreversible tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges organically through concrete actions and images (birds carrying messages, the NOW spark). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final line's conceptual repricing of silence and vigilance is earned, though slightly more ambiguity could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that remains consistent under pressure. The prose is highly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature. Purposeful compression (e.g., the Queen's whispered coordinates) is taught and pays off. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and highly purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "conspiratorial eyebrow" and "conspiratorial wink," which feel slightly repetitive and strain the metaphor. This creates a minor figurative muddle but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of a lock sentinel, a quill holder, and a forge of ideas feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, tactile details and a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk-taking in the lyrical, compressed prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
