<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prophet's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her final choice to engage the reef is earned by prior causality and parental lesson, with visible cost in the trembling limes and shifted rotation. Contradictory impulses (fear flickered, but she breathed through it) act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (obstacle becomes orchestra) with undeniable cost felt in the orchard's timid but certain nudge and the prophet's lowered mallet. Orientation is immediate; pattern-teaching is consistent and pays off at closure with persistent constraint (parental lesson) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated and constrains choices throughout. The floating orchard pressures tactics (rotation toward hazard), and the glass reef charges the final image as a marimba. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, with citrus mist and salt wind reflecting urgency. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by prophet's agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the orchard's shift toward hazard and the final transformation. Pressure coheres through density increase (carving grooves, fractal rhythm) that reweights the stake. One meaningful tightening (reef surfaces) forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images (obstacle into instrument), with subtext in gesture and implication. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the glass marimba reweights prior material with conceptual cost earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with consistent POV and voice modulation. Purposeful compression (lyric mode) is taught early and pays off. Diction remains within prophet's lexicon, with syntactic variety supporting rhythm. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates with scene needs (e.g., "Fractal generating arcs leapt outward"). Read-aloud ear test passes with varied openings and natural rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Core premise is transformed through specific grounded choices in character and world. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates.</comment>
