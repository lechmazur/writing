<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a tangible, embodied grief ("every tapestry she wove on the wharf unraveled at dawn"). Her actions are consistent and her final, decisive choice feels earned. A minor deduction for internal contradiction being more summarized than simultaneously dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost felt in the final image of the stone boat and the closing canyon. The pattern of sleepwalking and weaving builds to a decisive, legible shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The labyrinth functions as a literal loom, constraining Lira's choices and directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's accumulative, nightly agency. The dominant stake (mending ruin) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens through her actions. The cost is legible in the final, tangible transformation of the illustration into a stone vessel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of reweaving memory and broken precedents emerges organically from the central action and imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the stone boat and seed perfectly encapsulates the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled. The prose has a strong perceptual signature, with a consistent, poetic lexicon that reflects the character's worldview. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in a few high-pressure beats, though it never obscures clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaver, sleepwalker, and labyrinth as a loom is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
