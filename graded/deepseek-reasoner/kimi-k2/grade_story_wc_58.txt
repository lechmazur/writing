<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("knees stiff with cold"). The final renunciation—accepting loss rather than reversing it—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, though the emotional progression leans slightly tidy at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("feeling the shape of the pen like a ghost key"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The pattern of memory projection teaches its logic early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden constrains choice and charges the final image, acting as a crucible for the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("leaves settling like closing books"). The weft thread functions as a micro-setting object that evolves in use and meaning, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure intensifying through memory projection. The dominant stake (healing through acceptance) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the final image of the traveler walking "without expectation of arrival."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to absence and healing ("a coastline we redraw together"). Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like tying the thread to the nymph, implying memory as both anchor and sail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("every leaf looked like a small, deliberate obituary"). Diction remains within the character's lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats ("explained absences" slightly therapy-adjacent), but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief ritual and magical realism feels inevitable. The conceit of writing obituaries for the living is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise avoids derivative templates.</comment>
