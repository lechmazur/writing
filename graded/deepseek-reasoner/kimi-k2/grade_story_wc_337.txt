<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final choice to guide the fisherman's hand is earned by prior causality, and her endurance as a restorer who absorbs grief is consistent. The only minor flaw is a slight convergence in voice under peak emotional pressure when she speaks the promise at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through density increases and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on-page with palpable cost in the final image of Lira's mask now "gleamed whole." The structure is taut, with every beat serving the accumulation and release of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not merely described but actively constrains choice and charges the final image, functioning as a crucible. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Lira's professional POV. The net and needle are micro-settings that shape tactics and alter the outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each unraveled knot increasing the density of silence and the stakes. The cost is unmistakable on the page as Lira feels the weight of absorbed grief and the sanctuary's hush deepens. The final release of names is earned by the shared, difficult work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of silence, grief, and restoration, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Lira's own mask now whole, stitched with freed silence. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the net's knots as vows of silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lira's way of noticing through a restorer's lens. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potentially over-stacked figurative language in the phrase "a pearl-gray cloud dense with every unspoken farewell," but it does not obscure closure clarity. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a broken mask restorer in a prism sanctuary exhuming names from a net is a highly original and non-obvious synthesis. The combination feels organic and singular, not derivative. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains perfectly legible.</comment>
