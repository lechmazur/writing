<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara-Lira's contradictory impulses—teaching presence while practicing absence—are embodied in the trance dialogue with her younger self. The final renunciation (withholding truth as kindness) is earned by the magnetic grotto's pulse and the stone's unthrown weight. Her emotional regression is tactile ("heart light as milkweed seed"), avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (rings, aging, magnetism) escalates toward Conceptual Repricing where vanishing becomes "translation." Closure lands at "I am already gone" with cost felt in the grotto's release and the question-mark filings. Time folding is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto and floating platform constrain choice by aligning pulse and drift. Recurring rings charge the final image ("vanished into the reeds"). Sensory selection reflects trance-state urgency ("low, metallic pulse," "sound like a bell submerged").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via pattern intensification: rings progress from "ghost ripples" to decoded "widening code." Agency in withholding truth forces the younger self's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the grotto's hold and release, aligning with Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image recursion (rings, aging, reflection) without statement. The ending reweights "vanishing" as "translation" via the girl's whispered realization. Subtext operates in the unthrown stone and dissolving question mark, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific precision ("magnetic grotto tug at the iron") with lyricism ("sycamore hush"). Purposeful compression ("time folded like silk") teaches its pattern. POV remains stable despite time folding, with elision paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density ("rings from a stone she had not yet thrown were already spreading"). Minor figurative density in peak trance beats ("backwards river of her life") slightly obscures causality but doesn't harm closure. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragmentation toward revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of backward aging, time meditation, and electromagnetic mysticism. The stone/ring mechanic transforms the trope of prophecy into a tactile teaching tool. Risk-taking in nonlinear narration heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
