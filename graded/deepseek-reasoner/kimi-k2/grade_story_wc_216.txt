<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallization—waiting for the texture to arrive—is earned by prior causality, though the emotional progression from crying to future-as-velvet feels slightly tidy. The elderly woman applies immediate, relevant pressure, sharpening the protagonist's choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost felt in the final image of carrying "a secret currency." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern breaks (textures arriving) and a cadence shift reweighting the dominant stake. The ending lands on the page with cost, and the lens is taught early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo and the urn fragment function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's bias. The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, fully integrated into action and thought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by protagonist agency, with a decisive intensification (waiting for textures) that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible on the page in the residue of anticipation and the exquisite ache. Pressure coheres and grows through density increase and pattern breaks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of time as texture emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, and the core concept integrates fully with the theme through specific events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon, though a single register drift ("exquisite ache" leans slightly diagnostic) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic with excellent rhythm and information density. However, minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "scattering time like glitter") without a clear pattern-teaching payoff, causing a slight muddle. No loops or scaffold issues, and clarity remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a time-broken world with tactile, textural timekeeping feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on familiar material, executed with high conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking. The combination is organic and singular, not a checklist, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
