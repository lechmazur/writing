<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and deeply character-particular, embodied in the poet's grief and insomnia. His motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is dramatized through active choices like planting the postcard and listening to the wind. The final renunciation (sleeping, releasing the chapbook) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The sister's memory is a constant, contradictory impulse that drives his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The cost is legible on the page: "he felt the armistice settle inside his ribs like a seed that would not bloom until the next longing arrived." The pattern of lullabies and star-flowers builds density that reweights the dominant stake of grief versus forgetting, culminating in a decisive conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is not merely a backdrop; it functions as a micro-setting that constrains the poet's existence and choices (e.g., "ensconce himself inside the smallest chamber"). It also charges the final image, becoming "a gargantuan lantern." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered entirely through the poet's melancholic, longing-filled perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens. His choice to plant the postcard is a major tightening that narrows his options and leads directly to the vine's growth and his eventual sleep. The cost is unmistakable: centuries of waiting and the tangible, tear-watered growth of the star-vine. The dominant stake of his grief is deepened and transformed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into art emerges organically from the specific events and images, never stated directly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the armistice is between memory and forgetting, and pain is photosynthesized into new constellations. The final image of the shell as a lantern reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in the poet's lyrical, grief-stricken consciousness. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, even under the pressure of poetic density. Purposeful elision (e.g., the sister's specific story) is taught and paid off in the dream revelation. The prose is character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor risk of figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like coral bleached then dyed by reef-shadow joy"), but the pattern is taught and consistent, serving the accumulative drive. No loops, scaffolds, or muddle obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of an insomniac poet, a galactic postcard, and an ammonite shell is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "blossom armistice" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the poet's ritualistic actions. The risk-taking—a centuries-spanning, accumulative lyricism—heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
