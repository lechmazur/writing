<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her role as a noticer, compelling her to act. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, exemplified by her embodied grief and the micro-choice to plant seeds. The final renunciation (accepting the need to grow the future) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The tea house keeper applies immediate, relevant pressure, and their status dynamic is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and holds, building pressure through density and pattern until a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph. The final image of the first shoot pushing through frost is a decisive conceptual repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable cost, fulfilling the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is not merely vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The overgrown courtyard pressures the protagonist's gardening method, and the bakery's absence is a tangible constraint. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's specific bias, as seen in the description of the moss-swallowed marble and the darker stone rectangle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from passive cataloguing of loss to the active, costly choice to plant seeds. The dominant stake (preserving memory vs. coaxing the future) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible in the act of planting and the final image, though the external pressure remains subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from events and images, not statement. The core concept of "tenuous absolution" is fully integrated and paid off in the final realization that the sacred was in the acts, not the things. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving profound thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in the precise, lyrical prose. The narrator's way of noticing is character-specific and consistent. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the baker's backstory) are taught early and paid off, enriching the texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph is a masterclass in propulsion and closure, with every word serving the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of a "creeping normality noticer" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of guerrilla gardening with profound loss is organic and highly specific. The story commits fully to its premise, and the risk-taking in its quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
