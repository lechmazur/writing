<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (giving the coin) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—being an arsonist's daughter who runs toward fire—is dramatized, not summarized, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost as Mara sets the final bird adrift, reconfiguring her pain into compassion. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density increases and a cadence shift at the climax. A persistent constraint (the father's markers) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not merely descriptive; they function as a micro-setting that constrains choice (her boots sink in it) and decisively charge the final image (the sand birds singing on the water). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Mara's professional and personal POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the boy's cry introduces a complication, and Mara's choice to help and then gift the coin is a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake (transforming pain). The cost—relinquishing her compass—is legible on the page and charges the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming pain into compassion emerges organically from concrete events and images (the coin, the sand birds) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the singing sand bird, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is character-specific and consistent, with any elision (e.g., the boy's backstory) being purposeful and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a sound like water striking hot stone" following other metaphors) but it does not obscure closure clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or coherence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the arsonist's daughter firefighter with the thematic concept of unyielding compassion is specific, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
