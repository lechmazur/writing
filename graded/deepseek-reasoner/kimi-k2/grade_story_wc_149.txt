<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in contradictory impulses (love and betrayal). The final choice to forgive is earned by prior causality with visible cost (her fading). Embodied emotion is strong, e.g., "voice like wind through dead leaves."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (release and dawn) with felt cost (her dissolution). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through resonant imagery. The persistent constraint of her debt shapes the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, e.g., "frost on the glowing fruit." The environment evolves causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The stake (repaying a debt) tightens through her deliberate action of pressing the bead, with cost legible in her fading form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the theme of love and betrayal through the image of snow carrying "fragments of love." Subtext operates through image and implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and voice is consistent, with purposeful compression, e.g., "mournful elation." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, e.g., "resonant awakenings." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ghost story and alchemical romance feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. High irreplaceability.</comment>
