<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses (combative tenderness, walking backwards) are embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to guide the shadow-child is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the tremor of newfound weight. The emotional progression is realistic, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the page with felt cost ("tremor of newfound weight"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (tea leaves rearranging) reweighting stakes. The persistent constraint of reversible exile shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library constrains choice (shelves shift to reveal staircase) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust motes drift like slow constellations"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the shadow's resistance and final solidification. The dominant stake (reversing exile) tightens through the geometry of tea leaves and the decisive choice to drink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to resilience through the image of the spiral staircase and the final annotation. Theme emerges organically from particulars (tea leaves, shadow) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("combative tenderness braided tight"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision (tea leaves as letters) are taught early and paid off. POV is stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Syntax and rhythm accelerate with scene needs ("steam coils around her wrists like shackles dissolving").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of elements feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression, symbolic objects) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise offers a fresh angle on exile and memory.</comment>
