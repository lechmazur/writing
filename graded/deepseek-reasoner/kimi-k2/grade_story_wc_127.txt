<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vale's internal contradiction between professional detachment and sudden vulnerability is dramatized through embodied sensation ("static whispered...tremor of recognition") and a micro-choice (pressing fingers to the blotter) that reveals her hierarchy of values. The final choice to take the buyer's hand is earned by the causal chain of her detachment dissolving, foreclosing her old life with visible cost ("lose the privilege of distance").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of two "flawed instruments finally tuned to the same key" reconfigures the relationship with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: emotional density increases through the shared static filament, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in Vale's realization of "the price she had never listed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber grotto is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, its "resinous walls" humming to diffuse emotion and its dimming light mirroring the internal shift. The blotter petal evolves from a passive tool to an active, pulsing heart that forces the climactic connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Vale's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Vale's attempt to sell the emotion backfires when the buyer's suppressed longing leaks through the static, forcing a deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is unmistakable as her "counterfeit skins begin to slough," narrowing her options to a genuine connection. The dominant stake (understanding vs. distance) tightens through this single, meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of emotional authenticity versus curated detachment emerges through concrete particulars (vials of "half truths," the blotter petal swelling) and is resolved non-literally in the final image of shared tuning. Subtext operates in gesture (mirrored palm gesture) and silence, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question through reclamation, not statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("static electricity," "crackle against her fingertips"). The voice modulates with emotional intensity, shifting from clinically detached ("affectionate detachment") to raw and unedited ("raw, unedited ache"). Purposeful compression ("as the transformation completes") is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though some figurative language in peak beats ("like a tongue tasting a lie") slightly strains coherence. Rhythm is controlled and varies with emotional pressure. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Minor deduction for a single mixed metaphor that does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a counterfeit emotion dealer is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices (blotter petal, static electricity sensing) heighten stakes and coherence. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off with a legible closure effect. The story commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
