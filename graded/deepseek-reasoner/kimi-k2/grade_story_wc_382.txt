<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. Widow's "patiently nimble fingers" and enigmatic motives create compelling crucible dynamics. Final choice to accept the seal's weight feels earned through prior causality with visible cost ("wax branding memory into skin"). Minor deduction for slight diagnostic phrasing ("I understood then that fluency...").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern-based escalation through ritual and image repetition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the branding moment and wall's seismic response. Orientation is immediate; causality tightens through the widow's lessons. The seal's transformation from object to conduit drives the final reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated into action and choice—the seal, parapet wall, and rooftop garden constrain tactics and charge the closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("crushed lemon balm and approaching thunder"). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The environment actively shapes the climax through the meteor shower's illumination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from sugar borrowing to ontological interrogation under Accumulative lens. Agency is demonstrated through active participation in rituals ("catalogued inflections of limestone"). Cost is legible in the branding image and the protagonist's altered perception. One meaningful tightening occurs when the widow presses the seal to the protagonist's sternum, foreclosing passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image patterns (seal, walls, language) without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of "agreed upon lies" as enduring language. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and silence ("her breath warm with bergamot"). The final realization about language being "mostly made of agreed upon lies" resonates without being overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with lyrical compression that serves the Accumulative design. Dialogue carries significant subtext and goal-pursuit ("To return what he borrowed"). Voice modulation under pressure remains coherent ("centuries slid beneath our knees"). The widow's idiom contrasts effectively with the narrator's reflective tone without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythmic control and information density without artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-driven ("punctuation burning before it could settle"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or register drift even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical realism and architectural linguistics feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of buildings retaining memory is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the metaphorical system heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The seal's evolution from object to character to punctuation demonstrates high irreplaceability.</comment>
