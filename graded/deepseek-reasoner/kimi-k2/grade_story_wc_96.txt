<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lark's internal contradiction between molting instinct and desire to remain is vividly embodied. The micro-choice of accepting the name "Anchor" demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Mira's ink-stained fingers and dream-cataloging establish immediate, specific pressure. Emotional progression feels authentic through irrational resistance to shedding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through density of imagery toward Charged Poise closure. The burial of the tin under the sapling reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and functional. The final image of paper birds drifting over walls serves as a resonant reconfiguration that weights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (hiding books behind panels) and charges the final image (skeletal against sky). Sensory details are purposefully selective—mildewed paper, gunpowder, bullet-hole skylight—all filtered through POV. The sapling in concrete becomes a key object that shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resistance through words) escalates through the warden's threat to torch the annex, forcing immediate action. Agency is clear in the decision to fold poems into artifacts and bury the tin. Cost is legible in Lark's departure and the imminent destruction. One meaningful tightening (time pressure) sufficiently deepens under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (paper birds as non-violent grenades) and actions (rebuilding shelves by secret taxonomy). The ending line "Beauty is the quietest riot" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like Mira kissing the inked wrist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic yet precise diction ("hinges bleeding rust", "voice soft as moth wings"). POV remains strictly anchored in Lark. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("Does exile make the poem sharper?"). Elision (e.g., how they access yard) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density without overwriting. Figurative language is consistent and functional ("luminous fracture between despair and defiance"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match tension. Closure image achieves textural specificity without blurring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poetic resistance within carceral setting. The molting mechanic transforms the trope of identity through specific cost. Risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
