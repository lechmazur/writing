<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation crystallizes through embodied memory recall ("her mercury skin began to flow, reflecting not futures but pasts"). The final choice to speak the language is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("each word she spoke... would resurrect someone the world had chosen to forget"). Interiority remains concrete and character-particular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly with density increase pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost ("wept mercury tears that reflected... the true shape of what had been lost"). Orientation is clear within 120 words through concrete sensory details ("cold basalt wall," "ammonite fossils").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and character - the labyrinthine bookstore pressures choices throughout. The mountain's core ("stalactites of crystallized ink") charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV bias ("air tasted of iron and old parchment").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens through density increase. The stone's growing warmth creates coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the climax where speaking words resurrects the forgotten. One meaningful tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars rather than statement. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer ("home wasn't a place but a language") that reweights prior material. No moralizing - complexity embraced through the cost of remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation. Purposeful compression taught early pays off at closure. POV stable and apt for accumulative design. Diction remains within character's plausible lexicon despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Some minor overwriting in peak beats ("a sound like breaking ice and newborn stars") but clarity maintained. No loops or template cadence issues. Prose maintains momentum while serving atmospheric needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar concepts (memory, language, identity) through specific world-building and character perspective. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise transformed through grounded choices in the seer's unique perception.</comment>
