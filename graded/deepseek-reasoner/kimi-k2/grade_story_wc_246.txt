<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interpreter's "confidently uncertain" stance is embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure, particularly when her hands shake while questioning if mercy is prettier cruelty. The final renunciation ("gardener who learned weeds have names") earns its cost through prior causality, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("revised regret") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the fountain and memory droplets reweights the narrative with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and functional, with the gravitational anomaly's rules taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and fountain pen function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("hair floating like pale smoke," "water rose upward in spirals"), though the planet's surface remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the interpreter's agency under the accumulative lens, each edit ("unbend the lie," "edited the plague") raising the cost of tampering. The dominant stake (threshing meaning) tightens convincingly, with visible prices paid (grief widens, nib snaps).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of editing history, culminating in the profound, non-literal answer: "Meaning isn’t threshed, it’s watered." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity and earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision and consistent POV. The voice is highly distinctive ("boots magnetized to nothing," "lullaby sung by something heavier than love") and modulates effectively with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative muddle in one peak beat ("tasted iron, or maybe that was the flavor of revised regret") slightly obscures clarity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of high-concept SF and lyrical introspection. The premise of editing history through a physical pen is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes, feeling both fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
