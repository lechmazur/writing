<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply interior and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (measuring shadows, pressing palm to crystal) revealing her values. Her final choice to write the plague memory is earned by prior causality and shows visible cost. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language in the epiphany moment ("sculpting identity... was not an act of carving but of listening").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through sensory density and pattern recognition (shadow lengths). The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the obelisk becomes a page, reconfiguring the archive's purpose with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate, and the lens holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The observatory, forecourt, and solid fog are not just backdrop but active constraints that pressure Lira's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly integrated into action and perception, with the black obelisk's "spilled ink" shadow being a masterful, irreplaceable particular.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (choosing memories) and escalate through a single, profound deepening: the discovery of the obelisk and its impossible shadow. This reweights the entire dominant stake, forcing a higher-cost choice. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, and the cost of integrating the painful memory is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory and the cost of forgetting emerges organically from the specific events and the final, resonant image of the obelisk becoming a page of names. It offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The integration is flawless, with the concept driving the plot and charging the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's archivist sensibility, creating a distinct perceptual signature ("preemptively nostalgic," "summer quill"). The prose's lyrical rhythm is controlled and purpose-driven, modulating with emotional intensity. A very minor deduction for a occasional complex syntax that slightly slows momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("shadow pooled like spilled ink"), avoiding muddle. There is no observable scaffolding, synonym churn, or register drift. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly masterful, landing the closure with immense power.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-physical-shadow and the archivist's role is a fresh, non-obvious, and brilliantly executed concept. The choice to make the repressed memory return as a void (the obelisk) is a profound and original inflection. The story commits fully to its premise, resulting in a singular and unforgettable artistic stance.</comment>
