<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a clear hierarchy of values. Her final choice to stay is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, though interior contradiction could be slightly more dramatized in the crisis moment rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Liora's choice to name "Tomorrow" reweights options with undeniable cost felt in the final image. Orientation is immediate and pattern-teaching is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is intensely specific and purpose-driven, with the tapestry and silo constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, creating a fully immersive atmosphere that pressures the protagonist's decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the tapestry's revelations tightening options and raising the cost of the final choice. The chess clock stake is somewhat underutilized in the middle beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the tapestry and Liora's choice, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of intention and forgiveness. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation that heightens pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("cello bowed underwater") slightly obscures immediacy, but overall craft is exemplary with zero loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery magic, emotional archaeology, and a gardener's constancy feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept is fully committed to.</comment>
