<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is exceptional, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to erase the tape is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the broken watch fob and the sacrifice of her father's potential freedom. Embodied emotion is specific and avoids diagnostic language, particularly in the moment she tastes "the metal tang of her father’s worry."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Earned Stasis (refusal) that lands on the page with undeniable cost. The inferred Causal lens holds tightly, with every beat linked by because/therefore logic, culminating in Lila's decisive choice. The persistent constraint of the truce and the cost of its preservation shape the final, resonant image of the broken fob left behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The pirate market is a masterclass in micro-setting, deeply integrated into the action and constantly pressuring choices. Key objects—the watch fob, the cedar box, the wire recorder—constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Lila's urgent, professional POV, as seen in the description of the market's smell of "kerosene, cinnamon, and gun oil."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, with pressure cohering and tightening through Roe's unexpected reveal of the photograph. This meaningful turn narrows Lila's options and forces her higher-stakes choice. The cost of her decision—the broken fob and her father's continued imprisonment—is unmistakable and legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of trust and its cost emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lila's action, reweighting the concept of a "truce of hush" without stating a thesis. The final image of the broken fob serves as a powerful conceptual repricing of silence and sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent, character-specific perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, particularly in the climactic paragraph. Purposeful elision (the unfinished final word) is taught and paid off, deepening the closure's resonance. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, never muddying sense ("glow the color of bruised peaches"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and natural.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a noir-tinged smuggling tale with a deeply personal moral dilemma feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a "truce of hush" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The story commits fully to its premise, with bold risk-taking in the quiet, costly resolution that heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
