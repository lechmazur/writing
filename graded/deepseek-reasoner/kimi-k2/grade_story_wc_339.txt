<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's "quietly analytic" trait is embodied through algorithmic processing under pressure, micro-choices (writing dissolved letters) reveal value hierarchy. Dee's skeletal presence and candle-smoke voice establish distinct secondary character. Final renunciation earned through causal progression with visible cost (relinquishing the globe).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of transmission/static/surrender deepens toward Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation anchored in first paragraph ("ship's library," "ocean floor"). Cost legible at "let seawater in to mingle with 1937 sky" – irreversible action with felt salinity shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Library functions as micro-setting constraining choice (coral throne, rusted chandelier). Snow globe and recorder charge closure through tactile handling. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency ("boots sinking in silt," "weak bioluminescence"). Spatial choreography coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand surrender) escalates through accumulative density of transmission analysis. Protagonist agency drives tightening via rewinding/analyzing. Cost visible in relinquishing the globe and accepting irreversible mixing. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of release emerges through concrete particulars (snow globe crack, salinity mingling). Final image offers non-literal answer via "eloquence of letting go" without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Dee tapping globe) and implication ("anyone ready to understand").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("algebra can negotiate the abyss"). Poetic compression taught early ("dream that had forgotten to wake"). Dialogue minimal but idiom-distinct (Dee's "Call me Dee"). Elision purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density without scaffold or loops. Figurative language consistent and voice-motivated ("voice soft as candle smoke"). Rhythm accelerates with transmission fragments ("running north and south"). No artifacts in peak beats; closure clarity pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical mystery and metaphysical dialogue. Premise transformed through specific tactile details (cracked snow globe, barnacled recorder). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Final image feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
