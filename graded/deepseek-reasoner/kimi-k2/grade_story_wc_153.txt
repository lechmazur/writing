<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—fierce tenderness, regret, fear—are embodied and drive micro-choices, culminating in an earned renunciation. The final choice to "stay present" is motivated by prior causality with visible cost (the dissolving letters, the healed cut). Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "fierce tenderness," which feels more told than fully embodied in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira's stance crystallizes in the final mirror image, reweighting prior material with undeniable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern breaks (the blank letter, the blood-writing) escalating pressure. The final image of the boy's older, smiling face makes the cost of her vanished years felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and the shard are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment pressures every move (sinking boots, braiding channels) and the shard's evolving use (cutting, ringing, crumbling) is indispensable to the closure. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with a decisive intensification at the blank letter forcing her highest-stakes choice. The cost is unmistakable: slicing her palm and the dissolution of the letters. The dominant stake (absolution) is signaled early and tightens through a series of deepening, pattern-breaking beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of regret and forgiveness through the final image of the boy's face, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the letters, the shard, and the condensation, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature ("moonlight already licking the cut") and rhythmic control that heightens pressure. Purposeful elision (the exact contents of most letters) is taught and pays off at closure. Diction remains within Lira's plausible lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though a minor register drift occurs in "fierce tenderness," which slightly abstracts an otherwise embodied peak. Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cryptic medium, a mangrove labyrinth, and unsent letters feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, supporting the closure. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity.</comment>
