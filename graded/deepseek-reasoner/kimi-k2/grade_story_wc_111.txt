<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices (polishing marbles, choosing paths) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final choice to leave the split marble buried is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The queen's transformation from skepticism to wonder is legible through subtle gestures, not stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred hybrid lens (causal/textural) holds; Lira's actions cause the garden's response. Closure is a decisive change (wisteria blooms, device cracks) with undeniable conceptual cost (the queen's worldview shattered). Orientation is immediate; causality is tight and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden maze is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources (vines shift, paths shorten). The recurring object (marbles) constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Lira's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the hybrid lens; her storytelling tightens the pressure until the garden responds. The cost is unmistakable: the queen's device cracks, mirroring the marble's fracture. The dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) is tested and resolved on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. measurable luck) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("everything remembers"). Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (queen touching the vine) and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct; Lira's perceptual signature ("blooming withering") is consistent. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression (e.g., "years later" coda) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("hesitant stars," "tiny flawed moons") is precise and legible. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of magic and science. The core concept (mended deception) is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (lyric compression, hybrid lens) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
