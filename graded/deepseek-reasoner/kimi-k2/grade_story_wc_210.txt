<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's contradictory impulses—rejecting false comfort while conceiving a new civilization—are dramatized through micro-choices like sitting on the well curb. His final renunciation of the bottle and departure is earned by prior causality, with the cost legible in his "small, fierce smile" of a builder who has found a foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is felt in the final image of the town "inhaling" and the alchemist's footprints lit by an internal lantern. The amber bottle's transformation from false hope to acknowledged guardian of memory provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cove itself functions as a micro-setting that pressures choice—its silence and decay force the alchemist's internal turn. The amber bottle constrains his tactics for years and charges the final image when it glows on the stage, reweighting its meaning from false comfort to acknowledged memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the alchemist's agency under the Accumulative lens: his realization about the bottle's message forces a stance crystallization. The cost is unmistakable in his rejection of false comfort and the tangible shift in the cove's atmosphere as he speaks his blueprint, foreclosing the path of wishing for a return to the past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the theme of revival through the image of the self-generated lantern and the "architecture of his conceived civilization." The theme emerges organically from the particulars of the bottle, the cove, and the act of conception, resisting moralizing in favor of complex reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure, with elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of "working memory") taught and paid off at closure. The voice is consistently filtered through the alchemist's professional and emotional lens, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful (e.g., "shutters hung like broken wings"), with no muddle in peak beats. The prose achieves lyrical propulsion without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost town revival through memory-driven conception feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the accumulative, introspective structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the transformation of the amber bottle from MacGuffin to thematic anchor demonstrates high ingenuity.</comment>
