<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation evolves credibly from orderly pattern-making to urgent decoding, with embodied contradictions (fear pricked him, but mossy delight curled around his ribs). His final choice to join the cycle is earned by his prior monuments and deciphered rhythm, with visible cost in his dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian becomes part of the eternal cycle. The cost is legible in his body dissolving into motes of memory. The final image reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is indispensable, pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (fingers stained walnut, wind's confessions) and the environment evolves (bark softens to wet slate). The setting constrains and enables Elian's climb and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: each leaf adds density, the arbor responds, and the single trembling leaf forces the final climb. Agency is clear in Elian's choice to place his monument, with cost felt in the storm of ash that lifts him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical transformation emerges organically through particulars (extinct bees, vanished tides) and the final constellation image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and guardianship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, lyrical rhythm. POV is stable and voice-consistent, though some phrases risk slight overwriting ("borrowed lunar light"). Elision is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor risk of decorative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "motes of walnut-stained light"), but clarity remains and closure is untouched. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of folklore and transformation themes feels inevitable. The core premise of a seed sorter becoming the arbor's heartbeat is fresh and fully committed. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
