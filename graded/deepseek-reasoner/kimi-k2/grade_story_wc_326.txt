<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("heartbeats drumming 97, 98, 99"). The final choice to step into the vortex is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality, foreclosing her ghostly path with visible cost (heartbeats slowing). Contradictory impulses of digital ghost and physical being act simultaneously throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases through ink constellations and heartbeat sync, culminating in a decisive Conceptual Repricing ("identity is not a file to be deleted"). Closure lands on-page with undeniable cost (the fused shard, the corrected certificate) and is shaped by the persistent constraint of the counting pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory is not a postcard; its opal dome and frost-glazed panels pressure the choice ("the ink rose in filaments"). The porcelain shard, a micro-setting, constrains the final action and charges the closure image by fusing into the dome as a "dark star." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's urgent, counting consciousness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: the protagonist's choice to use the shard in the ink deepens the stakes, synchronizing her "faulty data" with the patterns and forcing the final stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the slowing heartbeats and the physical fusion of the shard, a trade-off that alters her state fundamentally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of identity as a pattern emerges entirely from the concrete action of tracing constellations in ink, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final wisdom. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a conceptual repricing that reweights the entire premise of the death certificate error and the nature of being.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in counting and digital ghost imagery. The voice modulates with emotional intensity, compressing under peak stress while maintaining its lyrical, precise texture. Purposeful elision (the exact mechanics of defragmentation) is taught and paid off in the conceptual closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density ("Porcelain kissed porcelain; the shard fused with the dome’s opal glass"). Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally with the scene's cadence. A minor risk of figurative density in peak beats exists but does not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital ghost and physical observatory is fresh and organic, not a checklist. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the porcelain shard and ink patterns. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, and the lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
