<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper's passive, witnessing nature is consistent and embodied, though his lack of a decisive choice or internal contradiction limits the score. His motivation ("to witness change without judgment") is dramatized through his actions and the final inscription, but the choice is more an endurance of stasis than a high-stakes turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift into the regenerative silence. The closure is a masterful Earned Stasis, a resonant reconfiguration where the keeper makes peace with crumbling, with the cost felt in the final image of "composted syllables" and "histories losing their grip."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely described but is the central crucible of the conflict. The overgrown library and the obsidian refuge actively constrain and enable the keeper's journey, charging the final image with immense thematic weight. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving peace/witnessing without judgment) is signaled early. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification into the regenerative silence, which reweights the keeper's stance. The cost of his endurance—the peace of "crumbling in place"—is legible and felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of regenerative silence and peaceful decay is fully integrated, emerging with profound resonance from the specific events and images. The final inscription offers a non-literal, earned answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece elicits a concrete, lingering emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, measured rhythm that perfectly suits the POV and theme. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the keeper's perception. The prose's texture—its syntax, diction, and rhythm—is a character in itself, sustaining pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a potential instance of overwriting ("cities bloom and wither inside dewdrops caught on fern fronds that were also his own eyelashes") which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity are superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (last keeper, magical library) into a singular, fresh, and inevitable-feeling whole. The core concept of "regenerative silence" is ingenious and executed with bold commitment. The lyric, accumulative structure is a risk that pays off, heightening stakes and coherence.</comment>
