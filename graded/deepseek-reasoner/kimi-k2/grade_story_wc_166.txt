<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysandra's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete, embodied interiority; her final transformation into a scribe is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The micro-choice to press her palm to the fracture demonstrates a hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses of rebellion and anchoring act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost as exile becomes a "studio." The pattern of observing gaps is taught early and pays off at closure. The cost is legible in the final image of the garden's pulse matching her own.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The twilight garden functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through POV, such as soil read "like braille." The cracked pool and black roses are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, via a decisive intensification (the act of fledging) that reweights the stake of memory. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the moonstone speck dissolves and her skin becomes a "scroll."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory's survival, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the particular image of "stitching exile to cosmos." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., "fledge") taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice is coherently lyrical, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with minimal scaffold. A minor deduction for figurative density in peak beats ("liquid starlight," "obsidian silver"), though the pattern is taught and legible. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of dance, memory, and exile feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with a lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular detail.</comment>
