<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to risk the inversion's end. Her micro-choices—tethered descent, grasping the arrow tip—reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance ("endure") is earned by her discovery, though her internal contradiction under peak stress could be more embodied beyond pulse-as-surf.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echoes and spores deepens to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost (gravity's return, sealed arch) and the final image reweights prior material. The arrow tip's integration is a decisive act that braids the memorial concept into the living core, fulfilling the drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (navigating by water flow, gravity inversion) and charging the final image (metal-flecked leaves). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional POV. The floating arches and inverted river are integral to the plot's causality and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: Kael's pursuit of the echo signature tightens options as the inversion hour ends. The cost is legible in the risk of being "crushed against the arches." The dominant stake (discovering resilience) is tested and transformed by her choice to complete the braid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of memory and growth, resisting moralizing. The final image of metal-flecked leaves offers a resonant, non-literal answer to resilience. The arrow tip motif charges the closure without abstraction, and the concept of "memorial" defiance is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature attuned to the planet's ecology. Diction remains within Kael's lexicon ("whirling silence," "aerial river"). Minor register drift in "saluting" trees feels slightly anthropomorphic but does not disrupt coherence. The elision of how she understands the arrow tip's resonance is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Information density is excellent, though minor overwriting occurs in "spirals that followed the echo clusters" (slightly redundant). No loops or scaffold artifacts. The closure image is clear and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of inverted gravity, memorial echoes, and botanical resilience is original and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
