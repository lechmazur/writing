<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptionally coherent, with her logical mind and tranquil perceptiveness embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to trace honest origins sharpens credibly, and her final choice to begin a new catalogue is an earned renunciation that forecloses the path of easy certainty with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through layered discoveries (stamp, folio, vault) toward a decisive Conceptual Repricing of the library's origin. Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost—the weight of the stamp as a promise against rebooting indices—and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken library is not merely atmospheric but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The vault's bronze doors, the cracked skylight, and the stamp itself are tactile elements that pressure Lira's actions and culminate in the dappled resolve that transforms into dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, as each discovery deepens the stakes of historical truth. The cost is legible when she pries open the dead electronic seals, a tangible trade-off that alters her tactics and leads to the vault.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between competing narratives, resisting moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of origins as hypotheses reweights prior material without statement, inviting curiosity beneath settled ink.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Lira's logical yet perceptive lens. Purposeful compression ("reclaimed stillness") is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("as though the stamp drew light the way tide draws moon") is coherent and voice-motivated, with no loops or artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements (sunken city, forgotten library) into a fresh, inevitable whole through specific detail and moral calculus. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels earned.</comment>
