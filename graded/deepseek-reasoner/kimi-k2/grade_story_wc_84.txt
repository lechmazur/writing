<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and embodied, rooted in her drone's longing. Her micro-choices (fingers hovering, kneeling to align the chip) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The pilgrim applies effective secondary pressure, though their voice distinction from Lira's internal monologue is subtle. The final choice feels earned, with a visible cost in the reconfigured understanding of belonging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira understands belonging is a rhythm, not a destination. The cost is legible in the final image of the observatory settling into darkness and the pilgrim's articulate absence. The pattern of star trails and missing pieces pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory is not just a backdrop; it constrains choice (the broken meridian line) and charges the final image (domes now dark). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Lira's professional perspective. The "brilliant dimness" is a recurring, tactile motif that evolves with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through a deepening of knowledge, perfectly suited to the accumulative lens. The pilgrim's revelation about the constellations and Lira's subsequent realization about her drone's longing constitute a meaningful tightening. The cost is the relinquishment of a fixed destination for a perpetual search, felt in the final silent frequency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "missing pieces," culminating in the resonant, non-literal projection: "WE ARE THE MISSING PIECES OF EACH OTHER." The final image of the open parenthesis waiting for its twin offers a profound answer to the question of belonging without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Lira's sharp-eyed, professional perception. The prose has a distinct, poetic texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with pressure ("rotors whispering like turning pages"). The pilgrim's dialogue carries soft, dusk-like subtext. Brief elision (the pilgrim's melting away) is purposeful and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, but generally purposeful. A minor artifact: the metaphor "gears gaping like mouths missing teeth" is slightly mixed with the later "sound like wind through empty type cases," creating a slight register drift. However, the sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the closure image remains clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi drone pilot and a mystical pilgrim in a decaying observatory feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of navigating by "star trails encoded in longing" is a specific, non-obvious angle on belonging. The piece commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative premise without retreat, and the final reconfiguration feels earned.</comment>
