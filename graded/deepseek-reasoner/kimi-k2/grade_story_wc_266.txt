<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The boy's characterization is embodied through specific reactions (flinching at the punch, throat working to say "Stay") and his transformation is earned through the guided ritual. The ferry guides function as a collective secondary character applying immediate pressure through their ritualistic actions and stories. Micro-choices reveal his values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the boy accepts his courage and walks the new path. The cost is legible in the star stamped on his pulse and the relinquished leash. The pattern of indirect routes and shoreline rhythm is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice through its indirect, disorienting paths. The lantern light, fog, and stone all charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the ritual's solemn tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift through the gathering, stories, and final test at the stone. The dominant stake (finding unused courage) tightens through the boy's progressive engagement. The cost is the relinquishment of his old life, made visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of summoning feral courage emerges through specific images (the leash, the punch, the stone) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the silver seam path and the glowing star stamp. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyrical voice with a perceptive signature ("lanterns swaying like slow metronomes," "courage had gone unused so long it had turned feral"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught and paid off at closure. No POP slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("sway like slow metronomes," "pooled like spilled milk"). Zero prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of mythic ritual and psychological interiority. The concept of ferry guides summoning courage through a vigil is fresh and specific. The transformation of the leash and ticket punch motifs feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical mode pays off.</comment>
