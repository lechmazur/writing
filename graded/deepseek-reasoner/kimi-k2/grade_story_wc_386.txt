<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Nadia's characterization is exceptional, with embodied contradiction ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer") and micro-choices under pressure (breathing on the globe, knotting threads) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—salvaging pure snow rather than answers—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the empty globe, the radioman's vanishing). Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density through recurring images (snow, starlight, wreckage) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the radioman unhooks his chain, vanishing into eternal snow, while the wreckage is "lighter by one secret kept safe." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the taught pattern pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are indispensable, constraining choices (candle placement, breath on glass) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("auroras trapped inside ice," "meltwater tickles crevasse walls"), filtered through Nadia's professional perception. The environment evolves causally (globe sweats, sea climbs) and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Nadia's agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening through density increases (relics bloom, threads knotted) that reweight the stake of salvage. Cost is legible: the globe empties, the radioman vanishes, and the wreckage is reconfigured. One meaningful deepening—the shift from seeking answers to preserving purity—forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events: salvage as reclamation of purity, not resolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "snow that never stops falling," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (borrowed starlight, confetti dreams), and thematic complexity resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical precision ("neoprene hood," "rebreather") and lyricism ("glacier's frozen breath"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("window after window") are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent under pressure, though slight syntactic density in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting risks in high-pressure beats (e.g., "voices still drifting the current like crepe-paper fish" slightly strains coherence) but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of deep-sea salvage, ghost whispering, and dream analysis, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The melted snow globe premise is fresh and non-obvious, inevitably interwoven with character and closure. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
