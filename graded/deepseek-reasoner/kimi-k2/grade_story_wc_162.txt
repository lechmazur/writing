<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Iona's featherly determination is embodied through concrete actions like tracing wood grain and whispering codes. Her internal conflict between fear and resolve is shown, not told, and her final choice to step onto the rail is earned by prior causality. The father's on-page presence crystallizes the relationship crucible, and his final lesson reconfigures their dynamic with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) achieved through Iona's agency; the cost is legible in the terrace's final dimming. The inferred Hybrid lens (accumulative pattern-building leading to a causal choice) holds. The final image of father and daughter sanding the chair reweights the premise of necessary distances with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and corn maze are not just described but actively pressure choices and charge the final image. The terrace's tilt and the maze's rearrangement are causal environmental details. The grain in the furniture constrains Iona's choice, and the bent stalk doorway is a key object that reveals the workshop, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Iona's agency under the Hybrid lens: her analysis of the grain narrows her options, leading to the high-stakes choice to step onto the glass rail. The cost is felt in the terrace's tilt and the "necessary distance" that swallowed her father. A single meaningful tightening—her breath rearranging the maze—forecloses other paths and forces the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of sacred thresholds earned through necessary distances is fully integrated, emerging from the father's lesson and the final image of sanding the grain that "sang of thresholds." It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept is embodied in the plot (the folded maze) and the characters' actions, resisting abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Iona's perception, with a distinct lyrical voice ("fractured hush," "shattered butterflies"). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (the smudged symbols) pays off at closure. The father's dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying the thematic weight without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with vivid, purposeful imagery and rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "prisms scattering light... like shattered butterflies" advances atmosphere, theme, and plot). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "featherly determination," but it's voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a drifting control deck above a sentient corn maze—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of weather codes, wood grain analysis, and the butterfly effect is organic and highly specific. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the story commits fully to its unique logic.</comment>
