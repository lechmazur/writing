<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lin's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (burning the film, proposing the broadcast) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice to broadcast is earned by the prior realization of their unwitting complicity, with the cost of the coast guard's arrival felt on the page. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label in "feeling the old blues resolve," which abstracts the emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: the microdot discovery forces a confrontation, leading to a decisive change (broadcasting secrets) that reconfigures the lighthouse's purpose. Closure lands with clear cost (coast guard approach) and a resonant reconfiguration of the mainland's "lights." The final image of the sea echoing the phrase as "simply music" provides a conceptual repricing of the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the finale; the Fresnel lens is used to read the film, and the lamp's rotation is rigged to pulse Morse code. Sensory details like the "salt-stained trench coat" and "gulls wheeled like notes" are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lin's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lin's agency under the causal lens: burning the film and proposing the broadcast are tightening choices that narrow options and raise the stakes. The cost is legible in Mara's drawn pistol and the coast guard's arrival. A minor deduction as the coast guard's benign resolution feels slightly convenient, slightly softening the final cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transformation of "open secrets" from instruments of control into public music. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of agency and communication, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's events and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure ("the lighthouse sway, not from waves but from the realization"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, particularly in the exchange about hating "the tune." The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that supports the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("the old blues resolve into a major chord"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. The final line achieves a powerful lyrical cadence that deepens the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper, fortune cookies, and spycraft is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed through with bold risk-taking, transforming tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and worldbuilding. The unconventional structural choice of the broadcast pays off brilliantly.</comment>
