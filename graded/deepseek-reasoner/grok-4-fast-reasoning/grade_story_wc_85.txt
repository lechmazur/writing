<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is concretely embodied through tactile details like "hands trembling," and his internal conflict between protection and truth drives a credible micro-choice under pressure. The final vow to speak feels earned by the causal progression from ritual to discovery, with visible cost in the weight of withheld truth. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly, with orientation clear within 120 words. Closure is a decisive change (vowing to tell the truth) landed on-page with cost legible in the watch hand symbolizing stolen time. The persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics throughout, and the structure's single-scene continuity supports escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "waves whispered secrets," "cool metal against his skin"), filtered through Elias's bias. The shore environment and watch hand object constrain choice by triggering his realization, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent from terrace to shore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. deception) is signaled early and escalates under causal lens via Elias's agency in sifting driftwood, leading to a tightening choice. Cost is unmistakable in the "crushing" weight of truth foreclosing his path of deception. No coincidence; turns arise from character action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the watch hand and driftwood carvings, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's vow, reweighting prior deceptions with complexity. Subtext operates in gestures (clutching the watch hand) and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical yet urgent diction reflecting Elias's mental state. Voice modulates under pressure (e.g., syntax tightens during realization). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., burned letters) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting ("sky bleeding into the sea like ink in water" verges on decorative). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story efficiently. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The black market genealogist premise is fresh and transformed through specific details (driftwood ritual). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, with emotional authenticity. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without gimmickry, and synthesis is non-obvious.</comment>
