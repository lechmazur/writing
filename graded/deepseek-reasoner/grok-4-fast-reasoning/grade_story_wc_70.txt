<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and consistent, compelling his choice to reveal the secret via a riddle. His involuntary truthfulness is a well-integrated flaw that constrains his actions, forcing the revelation. Lira serves as a functional secondary character applying pressure, though her internal state is less developed. The final choice to guide without spoiling is earned by his established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal, with a clear because/therefore chain: the blackout prompts Lira's inquiry, which Elias's truthfulness forces him to answer, leading to the riddle and the revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira climbs with renewed curiosity, the cost being Elias's reliance on poetic obfuscation to manage his condition. The structure is a single, coherent scene with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purpose-driven, with the tower's "skeletal" presence and the "nectar dusk" atmosphere actively shaping the scene's tone and mystery. The lacquer box and matchbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, as Elias's entire action is predicated on handling them. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (solving the blackout) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Lira's pressing question forces Elias's hand, and his choice to use the riddle box is a tactical move that deepens the mystery and changes her knowledge. The cost is the risk of his plain truth shattering wonder, which is narrowly avoided by his method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder against mechanistic drudgery emerges organically from Elias's actions and the central conflict. It is resolved not with a moral but through the resonant, non-literal image of Lira climbing toward repair, her curiosity rekindled by the poetic revelation. The riddle and the concept of the bee drones serve as integrated, particular vehicles for this theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's perception, with a distinct, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure ("words tumbling out raw"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot. The only minor deduction is for a slight register elevation in phrases like "nectar dusk," though it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. However, minor overwriting occurs in peaks, such as the slightly mixed metaphor "words spilling like honey from a cracked comb" following the "unbidden" revelation. This creates a minor figurative muddle in a key beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lightning-harvesting tower with a bio-engineered drone beehive failure is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is not just ornamental but fundamentally shapes the plot, stakes, and thematic concern with natural systems versus engineered utility. The specific, grounded choices in character and world make it fresh and memorable.</comment>
