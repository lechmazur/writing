<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as lying to access files. The final choice to archive the patch is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara decides to keep the secret, with cost legible when she lies in her report. The causal drive lens holds tightly from anomaly to discovery, with orientation anchored early. The Orion-7 constraint shapes tactics throughout, and the ending reweights options without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalating through Elara's agency as she investigates the numbers and bypasses protocols.

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the concept of absence not being final resonating through the final image of archiving the patch.
