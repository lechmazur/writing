<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's guilt is concretely embodied through specific memories and actions, such as recalling inking her son's constellation, driving her to tether the amber. Internal conflict is shown in her trembling hands and weeping, with the final peace earned by her active choice. Contradictory impulses of guilt and hope operate simultaneously, and the resolution carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as Elara's guilt is silenced, felt in the amber's weight and the fading cries. The causal lens holds tightly from motivation to action, with time folding as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds pressures choices by housing the device and letters, while the amber as a micro-setting charges the final image with its constellation-like insect. Sensory details like "humming ether" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes around hushing guilt escalate through Elara's agency, such as discovering the letters and tethering the amber, narrowing options under the causal lens. The cost is unmistakable when she weeps at the translated cry, forcing a trade-off that forecloses her emotional path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges through particulars like the amber reweighting meaning from entrapment to balm, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the meteor trail mirroring peace, subtextually deepening prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature, though minor density in figurative language slightly dulls peak pressure. Elision like time folding is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping; rhythm controls emotional beats effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, but slight overwriting in phrases like "velvet quiet" creates minor figurative muddle without harming closure. No loops or scaffolds; propulsion remains clear through to the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tattooist, lost sounds, and haunted firmware feels organic and fresh, with risk-taking in lyric time folds that heighten stakes. Transformation of guilt tropes through specific lived detail makes the arc inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
