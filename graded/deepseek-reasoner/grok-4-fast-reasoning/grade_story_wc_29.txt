<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is strong with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her professional expertise and cautious hope. Her internal conflict is embodied in actions like adjusting dials and initiating interference, and her final choice is earned by prior causality. The trait "cautiously hopeful" is shown through her determination masking hope, influencing key decisions under pressure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved with a decisive change (the signal warping, community realigning) under a causal lens, with visible cost in Harlan's staggering and the crowd's faltering. The drive lens holds tightly from setup to payoff, and the orientation is anchored early with specific details about the station and charts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The radio station setting pressures choices through its equipment and isolation, constraining Elara's actions. Sensory details like "low thrum of antennas" and "oscilloscope's dance" are purposeful and integrated into action. However, the setting doesn't fully charge the final image, capping it below 9.0.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Harlan's intrusion and Elara's interference, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the community's reaction and Harlan's collapse. Agency is strong, though the escalation relies slightly on external pressure rather than purely protagonist-driven turns.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between human ambition and cosmic deceit, with the ending offering a resonant silence that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, like Elara's "mask of ethereal calm" contrasting with gritty determination.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending technical and poetic diction. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, and elision (e.g., subsonic mechanics) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and strong rhythm. Minor overwriting in phrases like "ethereal pull of the cosmos" slightly dampens momentum but doesn't harm clarity. No loops or artifacts affecting closure.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of cosmic tricksters and subsonic interference feels fresh and specific, synthesized through character and setting. Risks in tone and structure heighten stakes without gimmickry. The resolution is earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
