<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final realization is earned through causality, with visible cost in tears and peace. However, internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost felt in the dawning hush. The accumulative lens holds, building through layered imagery. Orientation is clear early, and the window's revelation pays off the postcard setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the cathedral window constraining choice by requiring specific light. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image. The amber pavilion and melting snow create a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional peace. The dominant stake (understanding nocturnal flowers) tightens via patient observation, but the escalation is gradual rather than sharply turning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the postcards and window, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in the final image reweights prior material without moralizing, resonating with grief and art.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Elara's perception. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., hidden layers) is taught and paid off. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent but slightly dense in peaks, causing minor register drift. Closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, art, and botany feels inevitable, with specific details like the etched glass. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar themes.</comment>
