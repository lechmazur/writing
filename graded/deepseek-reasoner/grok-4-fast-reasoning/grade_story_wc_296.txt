<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as her hesitation before acting. Her final change is earned through causality, with cost felt in "her heart a battlefield" and the unbending of her isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands with cost in "her serenity unbroken yet deepened by the battle won within," and the seed's constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the vortex pressuring choices like the pull on her robes, and it charges the final image as the orchard becomes an "ally in quiet vigil." Sensory details are selective and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Elowen's agency, such as wading deeper and unbending the vortex. Cost is legible in the visions of guilt and her changed heart, under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the frozen confession, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in "what mirrors don't show" deepens through revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with high information density, but minor overwriting in peaks like "swirling orchard vortex" slightly dulls propulsion. No major artifacts affect closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable, with tropes transformed through specific choices like the flesh-eating seed's redemption. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
