<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her face-blindness and methodical nature, driving her investigation. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "heart quickening," but internal conflict is minimal, with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final realization is earned through her actions, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear linkages: evidence disappearance prompts quarry visit, ribbon discovery leads to insight. Closure is a decisive change as the sketch "revealed a face," reconfiguring the case with conceptual cost in empathy awakened. Orientation is anchored early, and the quarry constrains the pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like "mist clung to jagged limestone," shaping atmosphere and Elara's movements. The quarry charges the final image as "mist parting slightly," but it doesn't heavily constrain choices beyond mood. Sensory selection reflects urgency, though visual dominance overshadows other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: solving the cold case to awaken empathy. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from searching to finding the ribbon to the sketched revelation. Cost is legible in her effort and the implied breakthrough, though external pressure is off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges through Elara's art and the case details, with subtext in the ribbon's symbolism. However, it becomes explicit in lines like "unifying opposites," bordering on moralizing, which reduces resonance. The ending reweights prior material but lacks full subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct poetic voice, e.g., "mist swirled like unspoken confessions." Perceptual signature is strong through Elara's artist lens. No dialogue, so voice coherence is maintained without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative, with varied rhythms, but overwriting occurs, such as repetitive "furrowed hush" and stacked metaphors that occasionally blur sense. Information density is high, but some loops like "unifying opposites" repeated create minor scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a face-blind artist solving a cold case, transforming tropes through specific details. The synthesis feels inevitable, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality, though some elements echo familiar patterns.</comment>
