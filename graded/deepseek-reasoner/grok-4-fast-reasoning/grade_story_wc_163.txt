<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession, driving her choices. Interiority is concrete, with micro-choices like placing the feather showing her ingenuity.

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes astrology and abyssal exploration freshly, with emotional specificity. Risks in lyrical style heighten stakes, and the resolution feels inevitable from established particulars.</comment>
