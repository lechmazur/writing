<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied actions like the wrong turn and painting the shell. The "intimately aloof" trait constrains choices, and the final vow is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the "ache of temporary eternities." The accumulative/textural lens holds, and the wrong turn twists causality meaningfully. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains choice (narrow passage forces stooping) and charges the final image through the oasis. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, as the wrong turn deepens stakes toward the shell-painting act. Cost is unmistakable in the "ache" line, though the internal stake lacks external pressure, capping near 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically through images like the painted shell and oasis, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without statement, but slight abstraction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the vow's content) is taught and paid off. Minor register consistency keeps it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting (e.g., "salt-kissed summers") and occasional purple phrases slightly dull peak beats. No loops or artifacts harm closure, and propulsion is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, art, and hidden sanctuaries feels fresh and inevitable, with risk in lyrical style. However, it leans on familiar emotional arcs, limiting ingenuity. Transformation is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>
