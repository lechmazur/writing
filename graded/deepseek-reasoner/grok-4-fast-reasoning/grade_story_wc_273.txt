<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., using the drone). However, her "serene anger" sometimes feels labeled rather than fully dramatized in peak beats, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; closure lands with cost as Elara uncovers the time-slowing rite, foreclosing paths. Orientation is clear early, and the ink patterns shape tactics. Minor haste in the climax explanation prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the wind-carved encampment and ink patterns constraining choices (e.g., tracing patterns leads to canyon). Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under causal lens, from raid to confrontation, with cost legible in her disappearance. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the sorcerer's arrival feels slightly convenient, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink and time motifs, with a non-literal answer at closure. However, the final line ("cosmic mercy") edges toward thematic statement, slightly reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature (e.g., "wind-carved encampment"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, but minor artifacts include synonym churn ("ephemeral patterns" repeated) and a template cadence in action sequences. Clarity remains intact, though peak beats show slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in blending tech (drone) and magic (ink). Tropes are transformed through specific choices, and the closure reweights prior material.</comment>
