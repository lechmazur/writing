<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices. The librarian's fluctuating form adds depth, and his final action is earned by prior causality. However, slight static quality prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (preserved identities) under an accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in the vigil. Orientation is clear early, and the moon phase constraint shapes tactics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the tidal atrium actively constraining choices (e.g., pools for smelts) and charging the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder) escalate through the librarian's agency in capturing smelts, with cost implied in his effort. Under the accumulative lens, density increase reweights the stake effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events, with subtext in identities as smelts. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, resonating through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic prose reflecting the character's perception. No head-hopping; rhythmic control supports pressure, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and no obstructive artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful, and propulsion advances the story without loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style heightening stakes. Specific details transform familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
