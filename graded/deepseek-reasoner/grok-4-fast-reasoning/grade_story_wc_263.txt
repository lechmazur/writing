<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final surrender feels earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as creativity is freed, under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. The astrolabe and aurora shape tactics, and orientation is clear early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe constrain choices and charge the final image with vivid sensory details. Setting is integral to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in tracing stars and resting, leading to a legible cost under the accumulative lens. Surrender reweights options with palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like stardust, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gestures and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, though poetic diction occasionally borders on overwriting. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high density, but minor figurative stacking in peaks like "shadowed rapture" slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of stardust and creativity feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
