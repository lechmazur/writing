<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and observant nature are consistently embodied and drive micro-choices, like adjusting the stone stack. His final decision to join the chain feels earned by his immersion in the letters and the "luminescent ache" he internalizes. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("unfamiliar ache") in a peak beat, though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through layered discoveries (stones, letters, sea glass) that culminate in Elias's resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with undeniable cost—his vow forever alters his solitary nature. The orientation is immediate and the pattern of solitary guardianship is taught and paid off perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The lighthouse, stones, and sea glass are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elias's professional POV, and the haunted atmosphere is woven into the action, never stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is superb. Each discovery (stacked stones, letters, Harlan's note) deepens the stakes and narrows Elias's options from a simple supply run to a moral imperative to protect the chain. The cost of his commitment is felt in the final, solemn act of rebuilding the stack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the specific particulars of the letter chain and stone stacks, exploring isolation, legacy, and silent communion without a hint of moralizing. The final image of the relit lamp "carrying the bottled essence of safety" is a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's perceptive, maritime consciousness. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that mirrors the oceanic setting. A minor deduction for a single instance of slightly elevated diction ("spectral") that feels a touch outside his lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences are varied and rhythmic. A hairline deduction for a very minor paraphrase loop ("luminescent yet sorrowful, like sunlight piercing fog" and "luminescent ache" appear close together), though the effect is minimal and doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a reticent sailor, a haunted lighthouse, and an anonymous letter chain feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The specific, grounded choice of using stone stacks as a communication system is a standout element of ingenuity that transforms a familiar Gothic premise into something singular and memorable.</comment>
