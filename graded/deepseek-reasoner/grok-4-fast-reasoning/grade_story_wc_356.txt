<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and olfactory sensitivity are consistently embodied and drive her perilous choice. Her final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the journalizing action providing a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. The cost of her sensory torment is viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) as Elara endures the assault to find serenity within motion, foreclosing her path of potential flight with a visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density. The "turning of the tide's thought" is a slightly soft coincidence but serves to complicate rather than resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The treetop village is a vivid, tactile environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional POV. The corpse flower itself functions as a micro-setting that directly pressures the protagonist's pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the flower's bloom providing a single, powerful intensification that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of sensory overwhelm is unmistakable and alters tactics, forcing the journalizing action. A minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the tide's turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding serenity within motion is fully integrated and emerges organically from the particulars of Elara's struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of her dancing within the village's sway, reweighting the flower's decay from foe to teacher without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by olfaction. The prose has a lyrical, textured rhythm that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative over-density in phrases like "wildflower hush" and "tide's thought" slightly blurs sense in peak beats but does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of an olfactory herbalist and a corpse flower is a fresh, organic synthesis that feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical conclusion, with bold risk-taking in the intense sensory description that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
