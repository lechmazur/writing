<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "feral nostalgia" and "jealousy" driving micro-choices. Interior contradiction is shown through envy of past selves versus present understanding, earning the final renunciation. The change from burning envy to peace is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the scroll as a "talisman."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words: Elias in his mountain cabin after a dream. The accumulative lens holds, building through reflection to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where past selves become "wind beneath his wings." Closure lands with cost on-page: the grave's vision fades, leaving "quiet thrill."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "frost-laced panes" and "scent of resin." The birch bark scroll constrains choice (used for writing) and charges the final image as a "talisman." Environment mirrors internal states, such as the cabin groaning like "old bones."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: coping with the dream of his grave. Escalation is driven by Elias's agency to write, transforming jealousy into understanding. Cost is legible in the "weight" lifting, foreclosing envy. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through deepening reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like the grave and soaring, offering a non-literal answer: graves as gateways. Subtext operates in gestures, such as the scroll absorbing "wildness without judgment." Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's poetic noticing. Voice modulates with pressure, e.g., "jaded wonder" blooming. No head-hopping; elision (like dream details) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "feral nostalgia clawing") slightly muddles clarity, but no major artifacts harm closure. Read-aloud test passes with natural flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of dream chronicling with self-acceptance, feeling inevitable. Specific details like the birch bark scroll add freshness. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
