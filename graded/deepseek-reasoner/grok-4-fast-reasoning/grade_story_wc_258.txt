<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices like confiding in Theo. The relationship with Theo acts as a crucible, forcing choices that alter their dynamic. The final collaboration is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in vulnerability and shared effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise, reconfiguring options with felt cost in the "profound reconnection." Causal lens holds tightly from inciting incident to ending, with orientation anchored early. The inheritance and crash constraints shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the loft and rain-beaded skylight charging the final image of clearing dawn. However, the environment does not directly constrain choices, capping the score below 9.0 despite strong atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Elara's agency in confiding and multiplying paths. Cost is legible in the emotional and intellectual effort, narrowing options under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the cards and dialogue, with subtext in gestures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "living map" image, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with Elara's perceptual signature filtering details. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot, and rhythmic control remains under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, with minor overwriting (e.g., "shimmering black ink") but no artifacts harming closure. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cartomancy and post-crash culture with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
