<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and aligned actions, but lacks deep internal contradiction or micro-choices under significant pressure, preventing higher marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change proving the theory, and causal lens holds strong; however, the cost (nexus destabilization risk) is underdeveloped, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices via the magnetic nexus, but Q2 caps prevent a higher score since it lacks a persistent constraint shaping the final image with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is agency-driven under the causal lens, but the cost remains light and lacks a visceral charge, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the experiment, with a resonant, non-literal ending that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV leakage occurs with unmarked shifts between Elara and Jax's interiority, undermining voice consistency, though the prose has a distinct lyrical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting (e.g., "tapestry of sideways eternity") and minor artifact loops, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking in the sideways time premise that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
