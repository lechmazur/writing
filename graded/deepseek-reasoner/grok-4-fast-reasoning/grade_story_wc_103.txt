<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied interiority showing conflict between order and chaos. His final choice to disintegrate the fragment is earned by prior causality, with visible cost on page. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing under the accumulative/textural lens, with cost legible in "forever changed." The drive lens holds, and hyperbolic geometry shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vivid and sensory, constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are filtered through Elias's POV, with purposeful selection that mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elias's agency, from discovery to trap to escape. Cost is unmistakable in the climax, with disintegration foreclosing options and altering his state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges through particulars like fading photographs and hyperbolic geometry, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through experiential cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. Elision is taught and paid off, and diction remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., repeated "quaking reverie"). However, no loops or scaffolds obscure closure, and figurative language supports the theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable, with bold risks that heighten stakes. The concept is transformed through specific details, and emotional truth avoids cliché.</comment>
