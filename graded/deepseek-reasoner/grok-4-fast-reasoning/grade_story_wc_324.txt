<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her "persistently curious" nature and drive to "protect vulnerable voices." Her embodied emotion is strong ("fingers brushing the cool metal"), and her final choice to confront Mira is a high-stakes action earned by her investigative process. A slight deduction for the final assurance feeling slightly declarative rather than fully dramatized under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's intervention reconfigures Mira's options, preserving the atrium. The cost—the fragility of the voices and the halted development—is legible. A minor deduction for the final beat's cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a masterclass in atmosphere, with sensory details ("damp velvet," "bruised purples") filtered through Elara's professional POV. The setting is active, pressuring choice ("mist rolling in") and the hearing aid and photograph are micro-settings that crucially constrain her actions and charge the final confrontation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (protecting voices from silencing) are clear. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency: discovering the pulse, finding the locket, and understanding the threat to Mira. The final choice to confront is a meaningful tightening. A minor deduction as the cost to Mira (halted redevelopment) is implied but not deeply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (endurance of memory, cost of progress) emerges organically from the conflict between preservation and development. The final image of the pulsing hearing aid offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates powerfully in the locket's inscription and the murmured plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptive, poetic consciousness ("shadows clung to marble columns like forgotten whispers"). The voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates perfectly with the tension. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening paragraph ("fragile intersections of memory and loss") which, while beautiful, momentarily slows momentum. The closing paragraphs are propulsive and clear, with no artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is highly original and executed with specific, grounded detail. The combination of supernatural mystery, emotional depth, and architectural preservation feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The world's logic is committed to and followed with integrity.</comment>
