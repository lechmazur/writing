<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his vow, with claustrophobia adding credible tension. Micro-choices under pressure, like forcing the hatch, reveal values, but interior contradiction is minimal, leaning on struggle rather than deep conflict. The final choice feels earned, though emotional range is somewhat narrow for highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong with clear because/therefore linkages from entry to climax. Orientation is anchored early, and closure lands on-page with cost ("sweat beaded on his brow") as the codex dissolves, freeing the scientists. Persistent claustrophobia shapes tactics, but its impact on closure is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, such as the narrowed passage forcing Elias to squeeze through. The facility's corroded details and the codex's gold flecks charge the final image, integrating environment with action seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency under causal lens, from entering to activating the phase transition. Cost is legible in physical strain and claustrophobia, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory and honor emerges organically through images like the codex revealing ghosts, without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though some moments edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical phrases like "crashing hush" filtering perception through Elias's urgency. Minimal dialogue serves subtext, and elision is purposeful, though poetic density occasionally risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic but has minor artifacts: mixed metaphors ("unyielding whisper") and repetitive stems ("crashing hush") dull peak beats. Information propulsion is strong, yet figurative overload slightly obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of spelunking, undersea cables, and spectral science feels inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical tone. Specific details transform tropes, though closure relies on familiar redemption arcs.</comment>
