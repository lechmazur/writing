<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied. Contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. responsibility) act in scene, and her final choice to teach is earned with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional reflective density, but characterization remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with cost legible in tears and resolution. Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through images and reflections. Orientation is clear early, and father's legacy shapes tactics persistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The lantern as micro-setting constrains choice by illuminating scrawls and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports theme coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding legacy) are clear, and escalation under accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency in interpreting scrawls, leading to a deepening with cost felt. Minor deduction for internal focus limiting external pressure, but coherence remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in scrawls and reflections. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature consistent. Lyrical prose is controlled and purposefully compressed. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and clear, with high information density. Minor overwriting (e.g., "clover melancholy") and slight figurative density in peaks, but no major loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of grief and probability, with emotional specificity and risk-taking in accumulative structure. Turns feel earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
