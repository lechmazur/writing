<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his father's legacy, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His micro-choices, like pressing the door scuffs, reveal character under pressure, and the earned change—feeling "the weight of inheritance lighter"—shows cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as chasing silence while acknowledging his father's lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elias's story-telling reweights his past, with cost legible in "the weight of inheritance lighter." The accumulative lens holds, focusing on atmospheric buildup. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lattice's role charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "slick steps" and "copperlight" filtering through Elias's bias. The lighthouse prison and lattice constrain choices and charge the closure. Recurring objects evolve meaning, such as the door scuffs aligning with his pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias seeking to quiet his father's echoes—escalates through his agency in confessing, under the accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable when the weight lightens, foreclosing his path of inheritance. Pressure coheres through the confession beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, like the lattice holding confessions, subverting the fable without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer through "his father's wolf long tamed into repose," reweighting prior material. No thematic echoes or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Elias's perception. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "chasing the hush" with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or artifacts. Figurative language, like "thread the labyrinth," is purposeful and clear. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of the fable through specific setting and emotional depth, with risk-taking in lyrical style. The transformation feels inevitable, and the lattice's reprise heightens stakes. Fresh angle avoids template plots.</comment>
