<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with internal conflict embodied in his agonizing over the cog. His final decision to keep it hidden is earned through prior causality, showing credible endurance with cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias resolves to bury the cog, with cost legible in the secret narrative. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layers of reflection and discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the cog shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken city setting is richly detailed and constrains choices, such as digging through sedimentary layers, which directly influences the climax. Sensory details are purposeful and charged in the final image, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation occurs through Elias's internal debate, deepening with the journal discovery. His agency drives the choice under the accumulative lens, with cost felt in his renunciation. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict of narratives, with the ending offering a non-literal answer through Elias's defiance. Subtext is strong in implications, avoiding moralizing. The quick test is met with resonant reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a philosophical tone that remains consistent under pressure. The perceptual signature is character-specific, and elision is purposeful. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasionally ornate. Rhythm varies purposefully, and there are no significant artifacts obscuring clarity or closure. Minor overwriting does not harm peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise is fresh, combining post-apocalyptic decay with philosophical conflict, transformed through specific details like the chronometer cog. Risk-taking in prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
