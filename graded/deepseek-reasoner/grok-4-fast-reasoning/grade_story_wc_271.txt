<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply rooted in her trauma, with concrete interiority and embodied emotions like somatic markers guiding her actions. Her motivation to anchor optimism in realism is consistent and compels her toward integration, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her values. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shoulder easing and folded photograph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when Elara integrates the past into the present, framed by the pearl of stillness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density to reweight stakes. Orientation is clear early, and somatic markers persist as a constraint shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Elara's POV, with the arboretum's plants mirroring her resilience. The seaside cliff and automated lighthouse charge the final image of persistence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, constraining choice when the gazebo freeze leads to the glasshouse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increase in the freeze beat, which tightens emotional pressure. Elara's agency in confronting the photograph and sketching the orchid deepens the conflict, with cost legible in her eased shoulders. The dominant stake of internal grief versus hope is tested and reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like the photograph and pearl orchid, avoiding direct statement. Subtext operates in images, such as the lighthouse's indifference contrasting with human stories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to anchoring optimism in realism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct lyrical voice that reflects Elara's perception. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, such as the short sentences during the freeze. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful, with somatic markers taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has varied rhythm and high information density, with sentences advancing character and atmosphere. Minor figurative density in peaks like "confetti from hell" is pattern-taught and legible. No loops or scaffold artifacts; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike survivor, somatic markers, and botanical illustration feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details transform tropes, with emotional truth avoiding generic templates. Risk-taking in quiet, internal arc heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
