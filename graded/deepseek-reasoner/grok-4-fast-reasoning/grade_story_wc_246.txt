<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in regret, driving her to seek redemption. Interiority is concrete, though phrases like "confidently uncertain" edge toward diagnostic speak. The final choice to edit the past is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the pen's fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with Elara's edit altering the past, cost legible in the nib bending. Causal lens holds tightly from motivation to outcome. Orientation is anchored early, and the anomaly's constraint shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with the gravitational anomaly and pen constraining choices and charging the finale. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elara's POV, enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the causal lens, culminating in a choice that forecloses paths with cost (pen's degradation). Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though the vision of her brother slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges organically through events and images, avoiding moralizing. The ending's "unexpected harvests" offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but some subtext relies on familiar symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction reflecting Elara's perception. Rhythm controls pressure effectively, and elision (e.g., pen's mechanics) is taught and paid off without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and high information density. Minor overwriting in peaks (e.g., "confidently uncertain") but no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes familiar elements (redemption, time travel) with fresh specificity through the pen and anomaly. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
