<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's grief and motivation are embodied and specific, driving her to teach others as a form of self-renewal. Her final choice to help Lira is a credible micro-choice that reveals her values. The score is capped due to a minor diagnostic label ("grief-worn skin") and a slight over-tidiness in her emotional progression from rock bottom to teacher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is clear and held, building pressure through emotional and thematic density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's grief softens while witnessing Lira's transformation, with cost felt in the final image of shared tears. A single, meaningful tightening occurs when the starlight illuminates the curtains of intention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's grief ("perpetual twilight," "dusty relics"). The vellum stencil and origami figures function as key objects that constrain and enable action, deeply integrated into the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as her decision to use the stencil and create the origami deepens the thematic stakes. The cost is legible in Lira's tears and Elara's softening grief. The score reflects one meaningful intensification sufficient for this length, though the pressure remains more thematic than overtly dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of loss, renewal, and cosmic perspective, resisting moralizing. The final image of galaxies blooming offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to "wither no more." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, particularly the shared, silent moment of revelation under the telescope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply infused with Elara's perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical texture. The single instance of dialogue is natural and goal-driven. A minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("subdued ardor," "ephemeral and eternal") that slightly clashes with the POV's emotional state in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("wilted roses and shadowed cameos") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score. The closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic observatory, mourning jewelry, and magical realism feels fresh, inevitable, and wholly integrated. The core concept of "curtains of intention" is a non-obvious, ingenious vehicle for exploring grief and hope. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance without hedging.</comment>
