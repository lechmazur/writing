<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism is consistently embodied through micro-choices like sheathing the knife, with visible cost in the dome crack. Her internal conflict with her father's legacy adds depth, and the renunciation feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an accumulative lens, with the dome stabilizing through her calm actions. Orientation is clear early, but the causal link between her ritual and the stabilization is somewhat mystical, slightly weakening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The desert rose farm and glass dome are vividly specific, constraining choices when the dome cracks and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes of maintaining peace escalate effectively with the dome crack, driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible, though the conflict resolution relies slightly on thematic resonance over causal tightness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of peace versus violence emerge organically through actions and images, with the ending offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is strong, avoiding moralizing, and earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflecting Elara's perceptual signature. No head-hopping; prose rhythm supports the accumulative texture, and any elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, but occasional phrases like "senselessly perceptive" feel forced, and repetition of "tranquil blaze" hints at ornamentation. Overall, clarity and propulsion are maintained without major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes pacifism with post-apocalyptic survival in a fresh, non-obvious way. Specific details and emotional truth avoid template plots, and risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
