<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the characterization lacks significant interior contradiction or contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score despite strong execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost as the drone succeeds and Elias gains insight; the causal lens holds tightly, with the thunderstorm bottle constraining tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the structure is cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade and thunderstorm bottle are vividly rendered and actively constrain choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, escalation is driven by Elias's agency in the drone operation, and cost is legible in the tension and outcome. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through actions and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is rich in gestures and implications, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice remains consistent under pressure, and any elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and density, but minor overwriting (e.g., "brittle hush" repetition) slightly dulls peak beats. No major artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes familiar elements with fresh specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
