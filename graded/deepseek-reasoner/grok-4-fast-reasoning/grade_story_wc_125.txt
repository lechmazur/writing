<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover time's texture is clear and drives choices, with interiority shown through pattern-tracing. However, emotions like "subtle passion" lean abstract, lacking full embodiment. The final choice is earned by prior causality, but minor slips in concrete emotion prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with patterns building to a Charged Poise closure where Elias's pause reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, but causality is somewhat loose, relying on thematic accumulation rather than tight linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the terra-cotta grotto and rope acting as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Details are purposeful and integrated into action, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes of sacrificing past for future escalate through Elias's agency in uncovering layers and facing visions. Cost is legible at closure, but escalation under accumulative lens lacks one sharp tightening, keeping it from highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of time and choice emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in patterns and rope. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, fulfilling the quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, matching the character. However, occasional overwriting ("passionate subtlety") causes minor register drift, though elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but figurative language sometimes overwhelms clarity in peak beats (e.g., "texture felt in the heart's quiet roar"). Minor paraphrase loops and abstraction prevent higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of poet, energy beings, and time texture feels inevitable, with risk-taking in accumulative structure that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transforms familiar tropes through specificity.</comment>
