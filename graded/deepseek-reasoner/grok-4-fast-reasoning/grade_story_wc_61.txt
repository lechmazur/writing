<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion through actions like tracing the gear. However, her agency is passive; the final choice to share the gear feels more like endurance than a decisive change, lacking contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in "cycles unbroken." The accumulative/textural lens holds, patterns tighten, but causality is light, relying on atmospheric density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the nebula garden constraining choice via sonar pinging. The gear as a micro-setting charges the final image, integrating purposefully with action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density of patterns and Elowen's doubt, leading to her decision to share. Cost is legible in the persistent cycles, but pressure is subtle without sharp turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of generational patterns emerges organically through imagery and events, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is rich, avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively poetic, with a strong perceptual signature. Elision is pattern-taught and paid off, though no dialogue is present to test character distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, but minor overwriting and repetition of phrases like "troubling serenity" cause slight artifacting without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes cosmic sentimentalism with generational cycles in a fresh, inevitable way. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity anchors the vision.</comment>
