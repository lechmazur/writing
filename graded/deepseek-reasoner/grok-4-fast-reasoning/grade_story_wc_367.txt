<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in character, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is faint, and the Herald feels somewhat monolithic, lacking deep flaws or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (Herald's foreseen obsolescence) under an accumulative/textural lens, and orientation is clear early. The routine builds to a conceptual repricing, but causality is slightly ambiguous in the vision-driven turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the lighthouse and wick constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, though some description borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (shaping a new dawn), and escalation is driven by the Herald's agency in steering shadows, with cost legible in the tempered storm. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, but the conflict lacks sharp external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of renewal and cycles, with subtext in the prophetic visions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic rhythm and perceptual signature. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., prophetic glimpses) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is absent, so not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with good rhythm, but minor overwriting and repetitive phrases (e.g., "shadowed elation") create slight artifacts. Closure remains clear, and information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh, blending post-apocalyptic and mythic elements with specific synthesis. Risk-taking in lyrical style pays off, though tropes are familiar but transformed through character and setting.</comment>
