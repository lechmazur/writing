<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her flight from the valley and fever dreams; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion like "skin cool and thoughts sharp." Mira's fault-tolerant nature is shown through action, not label. The final choice to descend is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the truth's redistribution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reweights her truth, with cost legible in "the truth's burden lighten." Under the accumulative/textural lens, the smudging action and auroral imagery accumulate to a decisive shift. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific, with sensory details like "frost-laced windows" and "relentless mountain chill" that reflect Elara's POV. The weather station and edelweiss illustration constrain choices and charge the final image as a "compass," meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elara's internal conflict about impermanence) is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens occurs through Mira's dialogue and the smudging action, deepening Elara's knowledge. Agency is clear in her decision to descend, with cost felt in the truth's redistribution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of adapting to impermanence emerges through particulars like the smudged illustration and auroral sorrow, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "compass" image, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elara, with distinct perceptual signature in lyrical phrases like "auroral sorrow." Voice modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., fever dreams) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Minor overwriting in phrases like "ethereal dance a reminder of beauties" slightly reduces concision, but no loops or scaffolds harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements (fault-tolerant oracle, botanical illustration) feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical style. Tropes are transformed through specific choices, like smudging as a method for swaying certainties, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
