<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by causal discovery, though simultaneous contradictory impulses are not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal dominant) holds with tight causality; orientation is immediate, and closure lands with palpable cost ("cosmic debt pressing through the parallels") that reconfigures her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The decaying spaceport and green glass shard function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elara's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in redirecting the weave, with cost legible in the weight of the truth; pressure coheres under the hybrid lens to a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of responsibility emerges organically from the weave concept and Elara's arc, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping; elision (e.g., parallel transitions) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with clear propulsion, though minor figurative stacking ("neural pathways") slightly dulls peak beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping and multiverse weaving feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyric compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
