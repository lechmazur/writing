<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's pacifism is concretely embodied through actions like "patient reconfiguration" and recoiling from violent memories. His motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices. The emotional progression from facing painful shadows to achieving peace is earned and carries visible cost in his physical buoyancy. The final renunciation of violence for compassion is a credible, character-driven endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building density through the ritual's progression. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias achieves peace for himself and the ghosts, foreclosing the path of conflict with visible cost ("shadows finally at rest"). Orientation is immediate and clear. The persistent constraint of his pacifist code shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is a vital, pressure-filled environment, not a backdrop. Key objects—the photographs, the tapestry, Kwan Yin's tear—constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's consciousness. The setting's decay mirrors the internal struggle and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, as each stitch deepens the stakes and changes his knowledge. The cost is legible in his physical transformation and the receding shadows. The dominant stake of achieving peace through non-harm is tested and earned. The final opening of the dimension is a decisive change with clear consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of compassion overcoming violence emerges organically from the specific ritual and objects. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of ghosts finding peace. Subtext operates in the shimmer of tears and the weaving of pain into understanding. Avoids moralizing; complexity resides in the integration of humanity's dark fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elias's synthetic-yet-ethereal consciousness. The voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through his pacifist resolve. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, even under peak pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight adjective stacking ("ghostly resolve" appears twice) and a near-paraphrase loop ("ghosts of the past" / "ghosts of long-extinguished lives"). However, information density is high, and momentum is maintained throughout. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi (AI on a derelict ship) and spiritual practice (shadow work, Kwan Yin) is fresh and specific. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, compassionate conclusion. The pacifist AI protagonist is a non-obvious angle that avoids archetype. The final image feels inevitable and earned.</comment>
