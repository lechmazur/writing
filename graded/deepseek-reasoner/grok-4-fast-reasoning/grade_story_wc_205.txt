<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his past, driving the plot with embodied emotion, though some interiority, like "motivated by a deep ache," leans summary, reducing immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain with closure on-page; the shard and storms constrain choices, and cost is legible in "people's eyes gleamed with reinvented purpose."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, with the asteroid and time storms pressuring actions; the shard as micro-setting charges the final image by refracting visions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency during the storm, with a visible cost in the renewed unity; dominance under causal lens is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of poetic reinvention emerges organically, culminating in a resonant closure without moralizing; "sorrow burnished, but never extinguished" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic voice is distinct and consistent, with stable POV and effective dialogue; elision like "burnished sorrow" is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dense, lyrical prose with high information density, though occasional ornate phrases risk overwriting without harming closure or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; the poetic resolution transforms tropes with specific risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
