<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to serenade monotony is clear and drives actions, with micro-choices like nudging tokens showing agency. However, internal conflict is minimal, and flaws are underdeveloped, limiting depth. The final transformation feels earned but lacks visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost as the crowd's apathy shifts to engagement.
