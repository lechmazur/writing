<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the grille cloth. The final choice to endure and seek meaning is earned by the preceding emotional struggle. The "confidently uncertain" trait is more told than shown in its contradiction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost, crystallizing his new stance. The accumulative lens holds, building pressure through reflective density. The final image of the quarry as an "archive" effectively reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Jack's POV. The quarry office and valley are well-anchored. The grille cloth charges the final image, but the setting itself does not actively constrain a choice, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by internal pressure under the accumulative lens, culminating in a credible renunciation of despair. The cost of his public failure and brother's loss is legible and fuels his internal conflict effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of appraisal and performance, finding purpose in the quiet aftermath. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "after the applause" concept is integrated well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, weary perceptual signature. The prose rhythm effectively mirrors his emotional state. Minor register drift occurs in the "confidently uncertain" line, which feels slightly authorial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor overwriting is present in phrases like "a valley-wide echo of yearning," which slightly blurs sense. No major loops or artifacts harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of roadie and appraiser is fresh and specific. The emotional arc feels authentic, though the core premise of seeking purpose after loss is a familiar one, executed with high competence rather than groundbreaking originality.</comment>
