<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trait; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the brush, reveal values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible at "insomnia yielding to peace." Orientation is clear early; daydreams build pattern paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details filtered through POV. The greenhouse charges the final image and constrains choice by being his sanctuary. Smog mirrors internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; escalation through daydreams is driven by agency under accumulative lens. Cost is clear in Elias's shift, with pressure tightening via density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges naturally from events; subtext in daydreams implies kindness's echo. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with poetic voice consistent under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong; elision (daydreams) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and rhythmic control; figurative language is purposeful without muddle. Minor overwriting in peaks doesn't harm closure; no loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept synthesizes lost languages and kindness in a fresh, inevitable way. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
