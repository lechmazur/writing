<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens holds strong, with closure achieved through a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where Elias's self-forgiveness is legible with cost on the page. The station's map references and graffiti serve as persistent constraints that shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choices and charges the closure, with sensory details filtered through Elias's POV to mirror internal states. The ivy-choked station and its objects (timetable, graffiti) are integral to the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases as Elias deciphers clues, driven by his agency. The cost of self-forgiveness is unmistakable in the final beats, with a meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
