<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find Lira is clear and drives actions, with embodied emotion like clutching the railing. However, internal conflict is minimal, and phrases like "broken dreams" feel stock. The final vow to weave narratives is earned, but cost is somewhat vague. Strengths in consistent motivation, weakness in lack of contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise with Elara vowing to continue weaving narratives amid the ship's lurch, reconfiguring options with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds, building atmosphere. Orientation is clear early. Cost is legible in the final image, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and integral, with the carnival ship and fog constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details like "corroded pipes" are purposeful. The environment shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stake of finding Lira is clear, escalation occurs through Elara's narrative weaving, deepening under the accumulative lens. Agency is active, with cost legible as the ship lurches. Quick test satisfied, though escalation is subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of identity and memory emerges through images like the garden of forgotten names, with subtext in narrative threads. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Strengths in thematic depth, though occasionally explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, poetic voice. Perceptual signature is strong, e.g., "calliope ghosts whispering." No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off. Quick test met with rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but occasionally overwrought, e.g., "unkindled solace" risks mixed metaphor. Rhythm is generally strong, with good propulsion. Minor artifacts like synonym churn, but no major loops obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with organic synthesis, e.g., chimera twin and carnival ship. Turns feel earned in hindsight. Specificity avoids tropes; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
