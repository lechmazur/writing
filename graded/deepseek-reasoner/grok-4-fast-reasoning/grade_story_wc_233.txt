<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in disenchantment and dreams, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to break the curse is earned by prior causality, though internal contradictions could be more pronounced in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost ("the lace of danger lingered"), and the causal lens holds tightly from dreams to climb to resolution. Orientation is clear early, and the curse acts as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the grotto constraining choices and charging the final image. Descriptions are purposeful, though some metaphors edge toward purpleness without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Elara's agency, with cost legible at closure. The conflict tightens meaningfully, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a non-literal reweighting. Subtext is strong in motifs like bleeding starlight, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Dialogue is natural but sparse; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but occasional overwriting (e.g., "like a veiled threat") and minor metaphor strain create artifacts. Closure remains clear, and propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of queen, dreams, and curse feels fresh and inevitable, with specificity elevating familiar tropes. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent.</comment>
