<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with concrete interiority shown through actions like retracing paths. His "fiercely meditative" trait constrains choices, but some passivity in early beats slightly limits agency. The spectral mentorship adds depth, and his final understanding feels earned with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with patterns building to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Elias comprehends grief's "resilient braid," with cost felt in the "peaceful resonance." Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices (e.g., paths retraced) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes around collective grief escalate through Elias's agency under Liora's guidance, with one meaningful tightening as he unrolls the ribbon. Cost is legible in the completed gravestone. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the conflict is internal and subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the ribbon's patterns, offering a non-literal answer to grief. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, resisting moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control supports the tone, and any elision is purposeful. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propelled, with varied syntax and vivid imagery. Minor figurative stacking in peaks (e.g., "silent thunder") doesn't obscure clarity. No significant loops or artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration feels fresh and inevitable. Emotional truth anchors bold risks, transforming familiar tropes through specificity. The closure resonates without gimmickry.</comment>
