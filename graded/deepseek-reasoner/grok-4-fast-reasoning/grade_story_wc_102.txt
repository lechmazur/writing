<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is vividly concrete and drives the narrative, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the old man remains passive, reducing the relationship as a crucible, though his role is secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change—the healing and release of love—felt through the wound closing and past echo fading. The causal lens holds tightly, with orientation clear early and cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is richly sensory and charges the final image, with blooms and fog integral to the tone. It constrains choice by locating the encounter and mirroring internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in healing, with cost visible in the wound's closure. Under the causal lens, the tightening is meaningful and driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the camera obscura and breathing changes, with a non-literal answer at closure that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinctively lyrical, with perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Minimal dialogue is natural, and elision (e.g., past memory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with figurative language in peak beats, though clarity persists. Minor synonym churn (e.g., "foggy lucidity" repeated) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of spiritual quest, past lives, and healing feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in lyrical prose that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
