<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like the dive. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., "serene upheaval churning in his chest." However, contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in the final image. The hybrid lens holds, with causal linkages from motivation to epiphany. Orientation is clear early, but persistent constraints like the sundial are more symbolic than tactical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal constrains choice by necessitating the dive and harboring the chest. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered, e.g., "water mirrored the fading amber sky," charging the final revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency, notably the decision to dive, narrowing options. Cost is felt in physical risk and emotional realization. Under the hybrid lens, pressure coheres to the CR.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from actions like salvaging the journals, with subtext in motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, reflective texture. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is consistent. Minor register elevation in peaks doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, but slight overwriting occurs, e.g., "serene upheaval" repeated. No major artifacts harm closure; propulsion remains clear through to the epiphany.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific details like the sundial and journals. The synthesis of legend-seeking and self-deception is inevitable in hindsight, with risk in lyrical style paying off.</comment>
