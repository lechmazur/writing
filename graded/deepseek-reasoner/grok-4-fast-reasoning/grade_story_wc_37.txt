<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, internal contradiction is not strongly dramatized in scene, limiting higher band eligibility. The final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with cost (e.g., "her hands delving into the roots"), and the accumulative lens holds through patterned buildup. Orientation is anchored early, and the persistent constraint of fading light shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the alchemical orchard and mica window constraining choices and charging the final image. Details are purposefully integrated through POV filter, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elara's agency (e.g., humming songs). Cost is legible in her efforts, with a meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing or thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature consistent under pressure. Voice controls rhythm and elision without head-hopping, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but minor overwriting in metaphoric stacks (e.g., "forgotten heartbeats") slightly dulls peak beats. No significant loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis, with details like woven dawns feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
