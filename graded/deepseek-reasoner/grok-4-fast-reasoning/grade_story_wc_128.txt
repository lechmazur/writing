<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices; Mira's backstory adds depth. However, emotional progression is somewhat tidy, lacking significant internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (partnership formed) under a causal lens; cost is felt in the cycle of compassion. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight from envelope mistake to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the library and locket charging the atmosphere. However, the setting does not heavily constrain choices, limiting its impact on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation is driven by Elias's agency, and cost is legible in the partnership's formation. But conflict is quiet, with no major reversals testing commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of compassion cycles emerges organically from events, with subtext in gestures like the locket reveal. Avoids moralizing, though the concept is occasionally stated rather than fully implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual bias shaping descriptions. Dialogue is natural but brief; prose rhythm supports emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, but minor overwriting (e.g., repetitive "cautious exuberance") and figurative density slightly dull momentum. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Execution feels fresh with specific details, but the premise is familiar; combination of elements is organic rather than highly innovative, lacking bold risks.</comment>
