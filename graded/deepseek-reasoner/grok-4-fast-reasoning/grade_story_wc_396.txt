<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied intuition driving her choices. However, her characterization lacks significant flaws or internal contradiction, making her slightly too perfect under pressure. The final action is earned by prior causality, but the absence of genuine struggle limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change as peace is restored, felt cost in the dissolved anger. Causal lens holds tightly with clear because/therefore linkages. The crystal fragment constrains tactics, and orientation is anchored early without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, such as the orchard's edge amplifying isolation. The mirrors and fragment charge the final image by constraining Elara's method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though some description borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, escalation driven by Elara's agency using the fragment. Cost is legible in the compromise and shared losses. Under causal lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, but resolution is neat without lasting consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy emerges organically through action and image, not statement. Subtext operates in the fragment's revelations. Ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though it leans slightly toward tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with lyrical rhythm. Perceptual signature is strong, filtering details through Elara's intuition. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm without artifacts. Figurative language is controlled and serves clarity. Sentence-level propulsion advances story seamlessly, though minor purple patches exist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Combination of elements feels fresh and organic, with specific details elevating familiar themes. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight, but risk-taking is moderate rather than bold.</comment>
