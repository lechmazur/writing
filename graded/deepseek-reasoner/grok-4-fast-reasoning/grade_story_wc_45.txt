<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deep, with consistent traits and embodied emotions. Her forgiving skepticism drives key turns, and the final choice to innovate the ritual is earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Plot causality is strong with clear orientation early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the tooth dissolving into light—with felt cost under the causal lens. The persistent constraint of the tooth shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details like nightshade scent. The secret garden constrains choice during the ritual, and the tooth as a recurring object charges the final image, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency, driven by yearning. The ritual tightens options with cost legible in the tooth's dissolution. Conflict coheres under the causal lens with meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, such as turning mistakes into constellations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the echoes of laughter, without moralizing.</comment>
