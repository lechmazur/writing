<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's jittery nerves and motivation to honor Thorne are clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling hands). His micro-choice to give the pendant reveals values under pressure, and the shift to resolve is earned. Thorne's absence serves as a crucible, though off-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early; accumulative/textural lens holds with closure in Elias's resolved stance and the shepherd's transformation, costing the pendant. The pendant's vibration as a persistent constraint charges the final image. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory details (aurora, frost) pressure Elias's pause and charge the closure. The ridgeway constrains choice, and the pendant's reprise in the finale elevates specificity. No generic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (Elias's purpose) escalate through agency under accumulative lens—giving the pendant deepens knowledge. Cost is legible in the relinquishment and transformation. Minor weakness: external pressure is light, but internal drive suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (coaxing wonder) emerges through action and image, not statement; the ending offers a non-literal answer with the shepherd recounting legends. Subtext in the pendant's vibration avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct lyrical voice; perceptual signature shifts with Elias's nerves to resolve. Dialogue is minimal but natural. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and rhythmic, with varied sentences advancing atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks ("ethereal spirits"). No loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of relic courier and mythical elements feels organic; quiet structure risks boldness. Specificity in pendant and setting avoids tropes. Minor deduction for familiar mentor archetype, but transformed through particulars.</comment>
