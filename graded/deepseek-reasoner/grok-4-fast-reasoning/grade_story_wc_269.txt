<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past as a coral bleaching witness, driving her to assemble the model. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion in memories like "skeletal branches haunted her dreams." Micro-choices under pressure, such as tapping rhythms and spreading the atlas page, reveal her values. The final revelation is earned by her actions, though contradictory impulses are not strongly dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elara discovers paths have shifted, reweighting the premise with cost felt in the ocean's "eternal and periodic" whisper. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through details to the revelation. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality is tight, with her model-assembly leading directly to the insight. Persistent constraint of rising sea levels shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "salty wind" and "flickering monitors," filtered through Elara's professional bias. The station sways mirror her inner drift, charging the final image, but it does not strongly constrain choices. The atlas page acts as a micro-setting that reweights meaning, though environmental pressure is indirect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—escalates under the Accumulative lens through Elara's agency in assembling the model, a decisive intensification that narrows options. Cost is legible in the revelation that paths shifted, foreclosing her initial assumption. The stakes are visceral and driven by her actions, with no coincidence resolving the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the atlas page and bleaching memories, exploring cycles of loss and regeneration. Subtext operates in images, such as "paths rediscovered in the quiet assembly." The ending offers a non-literal answer through the shifted paths, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the ocean's whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, evident in rhythmic prose like "tapping rhythms" that mirrors Elara's mind. Voice remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful compression in the assembly sequence. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled, as in "orange veins across the water." Syntax supports propulsion, and line-level craft is flawless, with clarity maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of climate change themes through specific details like the smuggled atlas page and tapping method. Tropes are transformed by grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking is moderate but effective, with the accumulative structure feeling inevitable in hindsight. However, it lacks highly unconventional elements that would push it to the highest band.</comment>
