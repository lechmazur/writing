<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elarion's regret is embodied through specific actions like trembling hands; his motivation intensifies under pressure, and the final transformation is earned through on-page causality. The micro-choice to inscribe Lirra's name reveals his values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive holds tight from inciting incident to closure; orientation is clear within 120 words. The decisive change—Elarion understanding the weight of names—lands with felt cost in the final image, shaping his new resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "wet iron and smoldering coke" are selective and POV-filtered; the crucible and zodiac coin function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elarion's agency in balancing the mystical and factual; the heat threat tests his limits, and the cost is legible when he pours remorse into the mend, narrowing his options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from kintsugi and names without moralizing; the final reconfiguration ("guiding star") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through subtext and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with rhythmic control under pressure; Elarion's perceptual signature shapes diction and syntax, and any elision (e.g., Lirra's disappearance) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, but minor overwriting (e.g., "luminous regret" repeated) slightly dulls momentum; however, clarity remains intact, and sentence propulsion supports the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and zodiac coin feels fresh and inevitable; risk-taking in blending factual/mystical elements heightens stakes without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
