However, internal conflict is minimal, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the shimmering emptiness is revealed, charged by the cost of released moonlight.

The setting evolves causally, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The environment is indispensable to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in incising and quantifying absences, tightening under the accumulative lens with a clear cost in the moonlight's release.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that modulates under pressure.

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic, with high information density, but figurative language stacks in high-pressure beats, hinting at purple prose.
