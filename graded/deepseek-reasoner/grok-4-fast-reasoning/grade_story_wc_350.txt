<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's empathetic decisiveness is embodied through her firm warmth with Klaus and adaptive song-leading, creating a credible micro-choice hierarchy. However, her flaw of fear feels resolved too neatly upon her decision to act, slightly reducing the struggle's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the community finds harmony; the accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through multilingual murmurs coalescing into song. The cost of vulnerability is felt in the spilled stories of lost harvests, though the resolution's neatness slightly tempers the cost's bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain elevators are masterfully integrated, constraining choice (the clock's repair enables the talks) and charging the final image (silos into symphonies). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is strong, building density through the gathering of isolated individuals into a chorus. Agency is clear in Elara's decisive invitation and song-leading. The cost of shared vulnerability is legible, though the absence of a significant complicating friction prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of fractured tongues into harmony, resisting moralizing. The final image of "silos into symphonies" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduct for the phrase "construct bridges from silos" which slightly echoes prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature ("borrowed starlight," "silos of solitude"). The multilingual dialogue is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot and distinguishing characters through idiom and rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and purposeful, though slightly overwritten in places (e.g., "vigorous tenderness" appears twice). The rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative mode. A minor deduct for a subtle paraphrase loop between the opening and closing "borrowed starlight" lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a choral librarian, astronomical clock, and grain elevator talks feels fresh and organic. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, transforming a common theme of reconciliation through unique, grounded particulars.</comment>
