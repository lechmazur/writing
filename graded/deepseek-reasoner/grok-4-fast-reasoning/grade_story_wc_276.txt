<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, with embodied emotion and steady focus under pressure. His cool-headedness is consistent, and the final mending is earned through his methodical actions. No significant weaknesses; interiority is concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot is causal under an accumulative/textural lens, with closure achieved through Elias catching the echo, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is legible when peace is voiced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and integral, with the sound wave garden constraining choices and responding to emotions. Details like the rail spike and silence-vines are purposeful and charge the final image. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (internal peace), escalation is driven by Elias's agency under pressure as patterns break. Cost is unmistakable when he hauls the echo, altering his state. Coherent pressure tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence and healing emerges through images and actions, not statement, with subtext in the feral lullaby concept. Ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with stable POV and perceptual signature tailored to Elias. Diction and rhythm control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting in figurative language does not harm closure or cause artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is highly original, synthesizing sound waves, constellations, and emotional transliteration into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risk-taking in style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth is specific and durable.</comment>
