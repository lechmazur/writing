<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her dual allegiance creates credible internal conflict, and the final change is earned through causality. Minor flaw: she exhibits high competence without deep flaws, but this doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (vote to incorporate) with felt cost ("desperate measures had forged a hopeful path"). Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from Lira's actions to the outcome. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of privatization shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices—the raft city's structure influences Lira's graffiti method. The foundation stone chip constrains actions and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes against privatization escalate coherently under causal lens, driven by Lira's agency through graffiti. Cost is legible in the desperate energy and balanced outcome. One meaningful tightening (defensive perimeter) narrows options with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of balancing chaos and order emerges organically from events and images, like the phoenix mural, without moralizing. Subtext is rich in encoded graffiti. Final image reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity, though slightly explicit in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature—Lira's intuitive orderly voice is consistent. Prose has rhythmic control, and elision (e.g., graffiti mechanics) is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong propulsion, no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful, though slightly purple in peaks without muddling clarity. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of raft city gentrification is fresh and synthesized with specificity. Risk-taking in structure (multi-day span) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Turns feel inevitable from character choices, not template.</comment>
