<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear, rooted in embodied emotion and contradiction (fear vs. need). His final choice to coexist is earned by the stone circle's pressure, with visible cost in the breath-hitch and subsequent calm. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing with cost ("strength of his independence"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (reflections shift) deepens stakes. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The hum anchors causality, and cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atomically reflective floor constrains choice by triggering the vision, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "tasting salt on a primeval wind"). The tidal library pressures tactics via its central stone circle. Micro-setting (sundial) reweights meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency (placing the sundial, focusing will) under the accumulative lens, with a decisive cadence shift (floor's shift to reflections). Cost is felt in the breath-hitch and subsequent reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action (sundial's redefinition, reflections as "reservoir"). Ending offers a non-literal answer to isolation vs. preservation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silent parade of extinct life. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical compression ("contemporary of ghosts"). POV is stable and voice-motivated. Elision (e.g., "brittle awakenings") is taught and paid off at closure. Rhythm controls pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent ("atomically reflective expanse"). Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating with pressure. No register drift or artifact in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostly librarian and reincarnation memory tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking with lyrical compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative template.</comment>
