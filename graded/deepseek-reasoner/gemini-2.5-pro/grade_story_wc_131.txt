<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to become visible to those who need you") is clear and compelling, embodied in his final choice. His "kindly methodical" trait is shown through action, not told. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("a quiet click of satisfaction") in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, fulfilled with clear cost (his continued isolation). The final image of him slipping back into the dark reconfigures his purpose. Causality is tight, with his sensory ability directly motivating the find and the gamble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library setting is a character, constraining and enabling his actions. Key objects (the tape, the grate, the table) are integral to the plot. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through Elias's POV, creating a palpable, atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal. Escalation is driven by his discovery of the tape's unique urgency, forcing a higher-risk choice (placing it on the table). The cost of his action—maintaining his invisibility—is legible and felt, charging the final image under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and invisible connection emerges organically from action and image. The final moment offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy. Subtext is rich in the offering of the tape and Anya's bewildered gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistent and effectively conveys Elias's unique perception of the world. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("sapphire hush") which, while beautiful, slightly slows the initial momentum. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of a man who feels data echoes is fresh and brilliantly executed. The combination of a near-future setting with a focus on obsolete media feels organic and specific. The emotional truth of the central relationship (Elias to Anya) is deeply authentic and moving.</comment>
