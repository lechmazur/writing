<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied, his motivation clear and intensifying. His final choice to play the new song is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("luminous disbelief") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—the final note as a "question mark of impossible hope" reconfigures his options. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with patterns (the flake, the fluttering mesh) cohering into a legible, cost-bearing ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful. The mountain pullout and, crucially, the bridge with its fluttering scaffold wrap function as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image, directly enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a life-altering pursuit. The pressure deepens via the discovery of the flake and the code, narrowing Elias's options to a single, costly path forward. A slight cap applied as the high-band gate requires Q2 ≥9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transcending limitation emerges organically through event and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final act of playing, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the character and tone. The prose has a strong perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with purposeful compression and elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. A minor artifact: the phrase "luminous disbelief" is repeated, creating a slight synonym churn, but it does not measurably obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, specific synthesis of the analog and digital mystique. The integration of the wet-plate photograph with a "corrupted digital file" grid is a singular, ingenious inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes.</comment>
