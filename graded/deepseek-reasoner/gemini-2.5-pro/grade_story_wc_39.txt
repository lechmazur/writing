<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("positively wistful ache") and micro-choices under pressure (collecting sounds). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though the internal contradiction of the wistful ache could be more active in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the new silence feels "full and complete," with cost legible in the transfiguration of the box's purpose. Orientation is immediate and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The feral loft and shore environment are indispensable, constraining choice (scavenged shelves, net bag) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from discovery to composition. The cost is unmistakable in the final, full silence, a price paid for the act of creation that forecloses other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of translating loss into continuance emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the symphony of the shore and the transfigured box.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional ("ribcage of driftwood," "grey silk of the morning sea"). POV is stable and voice is consistent, with purposeful compression and elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("symphony of the shore"), enhancing clarity and propulsion, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of capturing sounds is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The synthesis feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
