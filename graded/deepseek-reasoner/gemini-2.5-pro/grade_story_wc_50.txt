<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") is a clear, consistent axiom that intensifies his solitary, obsessive focus. His "peripherally focused" trait is not just a label but a demonstrated method that constrains his actions and leads to his success. The final choice to preserve the echoes for a future world is an Earned Stasis that feels credible and costs him immediate personal gratification, charged by the prior causality of his labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through the density of observations and the weight of the "wounded season." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the restored mechanism reawakens wonder, a decisive change from inert silence to active harvest. The cost is legible on the page: the "oppressive calm" of weeks of labor and the choice to preserve the echoes rather than consume them himself. The lens holds perfectly, with the celestial clock and reflection angles providing a coherent, non-causal pressure that culminates in a cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is far from ornamental; it is the essential micro-setting that actively constrains Elian's method and charges the final image. Its polished surfaces are the canvas for his reflection studies, and its very structure is revealed to be the resonator that encodes the echoes. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through his professional bias, noticing "shadow and faint, residual light" and the "cool marble wall" he leans against at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification of pressure through the "oppressive calm" and the weight of weeks of meticulous labor. The dominant stake—preserving the last vestiges of wonder—is signaled early and deepens as Elian deciphers the "forgotten physics of memory." The cost is the time and focused endurance required, making the final, successful activation feel earned and significant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder through reason emerges organically from the core concept and Elian's specific actions, never stated directly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the quiet reactivation of joy and light against the "grey stillness," a reconfiguration of meaning that feels earned. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of stored wonder "waiting for the day the world was ready to feel them again," resisting a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable, deeply embedded in Elian's reflective, precise consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the quiet intensity of the work ("Days bled into weeks under the weight..."). There is no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature is consistently his, noticing the "ghost of the machine's operation" in "oblique glints." Purposeful compression is used effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("a lattice of spun silver and quartz"). Rhythm is varied and purposeful, though there is a slight tendency toward elevated diction in peak beats (e.g., "a celestial clock hand"). A single minor paraphrase loop exists ("The harvest had begun anew... They were safe now"), but it does not obscure closure or causality. The final image is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a "harvest of echoes" is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of memory, physics, and melancholy. It is fully committed to and executed with remarkable specificity, avoiding cliché. The combination of a locksmith reverse-engineering a celestial-mechanical resonator in a marble cavern feels organic and singular, not derived from common templates. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens the stakes and pays off at closure.</comment>
