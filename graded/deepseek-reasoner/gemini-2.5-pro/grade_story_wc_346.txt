<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in specific memory and contradiction (arrogance vs. duty). His final choice is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his fading essence. Embodied emotion is concrete and character-particular, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost as Elias welcomes the peace he gave. The pane of hush and final ripple provide coherent pressure, and orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse and pane of hush are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, reflecting the POV's urgency and priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive intensification (the thrumming, then the final ripple) that reweights the dominant stake. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, and cost is legible in his fading consciousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of granting peace emerges implicitly from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through the final image of serenity earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistent and purposefully elevated, suited to the epic, lyrical tone. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight over-writing in phrases like "a breathtaking, impossible arrogance," which edges toward summary, but clarity and propulsion remain strong, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of doomsday and grace is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic stance, avoiding template plots and generic choices.</comment>
