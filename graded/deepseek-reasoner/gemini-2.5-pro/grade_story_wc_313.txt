<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role and family history, intensifying credibly into an obsession. His final choice to correct the record is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The emotional progression from dutiful warden to truth-seeker feels organic, though the final stance of calm authority is slightly tidy for the emotional weight of the discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (correcting the record) with a resonant reconfiguration (filling the valley's hush with understanding) that lands with clear conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through discovered artifacts. A slight lens ambiguity exists mid-story as the causal search for photographs briefly dominates, but the textural closure reconciles this.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the dessicated reservoir bed and the dusty archives actively constrain Elias's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional and personal priorities (e.g., "the reservoir's water had receded like a sick man's gums"). The ridgeway and the hall become potent symbolic spaces through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes shift from measuring drought to measuring ghosts, escalating through the discovery of the photographs which deepen Elias's knowledge and narrow his options. The final action of expunging the record is a decisive tightening that forecloses the path of silence, paid for with the loss of a simple family narrative. Agency is clear, though the escalation relies slightly on discovery rather than active pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of story vs. history emerges organically from the particulars of the photographs and the ledger entry. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of communal witnessing, reweighting the prior material without moralizing. The complexity of "precisely humane" correction is embraced, avoiding a tidy binary of truth vs. lie.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the abrupt silence of the wind chime stretching the twilight into a thin, resonant wire"). The voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to archival precision under pressure. No dialogue is present, so those elements are not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Minor artifacts exist, such as the slightly diagnostic phrase "a quiet poison in the community's past," which abstracts a complex emotional state. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere without padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a resurfacing town uncovering a buried truth is fresh and executed with high specificity. The synthesis of the levee warden's duty with a personal, archival mystery feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a quiet, research-based climax is taken and lands with emotional force.</comment>
