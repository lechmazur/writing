<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the final, high-stakes choice. Embodied emotion is strong ("primal scream built in my throat"), and the micro-choice to endure rather than flee reveals a clear hierarchy of values. However, the internal conflict between instinct and purpose is summarized rather than shown as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable, felt cost on the page ("My breath grew ragged and thin"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through a density increase of psychic sensation that culminates in a decisive cadence shift. A persistent constraint (the dying life support) meaningfully shapes the protagonist's tactics and the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, pressuring every choice and charging the final image. The temple is not a postcard but a crucible, its "gathered hush" constituting the core conflict. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, from the "crushing silence" to the altar they lean against in the final beat. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly filtered through the POV's professional and urgent priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the psychic maelstrom, which deepens and reweights the dominant stake (capturing the hush vs. survival) with terrifying clarity. The cost is unmistakable, paid in the protagonist's dwindling oxygen and the final, quiet acceptance of death. Agency is demonstrated through the renunciation of instinct and the focused act of pulling a single thread from the chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of harnessing the ephemeral is earned through concrete struggle, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: the captured silence is not a trophy but a "companion." The final image reweights the entire premise, moving from conquest to acceptance. Subtext operates powerfully in the contrast between the chaotic storm of memories and the crystalline note of peace the protagonist isolates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by scientific pursuit and poetic sensitivity ("marinated in its own quiet"). Diction and syntax masterfully reflect the protagonist's degrading state under stress. A minor register drift occurs with "psychic residue," which feels slightly diagnostic for the otherwise embodied voice, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control. However, a cluster of figurative language in the peak beat ("snarl of a thousand lives," "dissonant orchestra") creates a slight density artifact that, while effective, slightly obscures the clarity of the protagonist's pivotal action of focusing on the single memory. This minor muddle in a peak beat caps the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of capturing silence is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of idea and emotion. The specific, grounded choice to use a "crystal perfume vial" transforms a potential trope into something unique and irreplaceable. The story commits fully to its premise, following the terrifying implications of a silence that "touches memories" to its logical and powerful conclusion.</comment>
