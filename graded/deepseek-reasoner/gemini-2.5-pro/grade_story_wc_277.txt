<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as an observant daughter. Her final choice to intervene is earned by prior causality, specifically her intimate knowledge of her father's "satellites of sorrow." The rosewood nib serves as a concrete embodiment of this motivation, making her decision to call the journalist feel inevitable. Her internal contradiction—protecting her father's legacy while exposing a deeper truth—is dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Causal, and the story adheres to it with tight because/therefore linkages. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), achieved through Celeste's successful intervention and the subsequent reconfiguration of the narrative. The cost is legible in the final image of her father's "painful orbit complete." The structure is a single, continuous scene with one meaningful tightening via the phone call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent, but its function is more atmospheric than constraining. It does not directly pressure Celeste's choices; the call could occur elsewhere. However, the rosewood pen nib qualifies as a micro-setting that charges the final image, elevating the score. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Celeste's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Celeste's agency during the phone call, using the method of proof by contradiction to dismantle the journalist's narrative. Each question is a precise, causal tightening that narrows the options and changes knowledge. The cost is the emotional weight of revealing her father's sacrifice, felt in her "steady, solemn drum" of a heart and the story's final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths and sacrificial love emerges organically from the particulars of the father's actions and Celeste's discovery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the stars, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The core concept of "orbits of regret" is effectively integrated into the thematic fabric, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, elevated perceptual signature that remains consistent and controlled under pressure. The narrative voice is confident and apt for the character's station and the story's solemn tone. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, efficiently advancing the plot and characterizing both speakers through its rhythm and content.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("orbits of regret," "satellites of sorrow") is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing clarity rather than muddying it. The final sentence is a masterful image that resolves the story with immense thematic weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's originality lies in its specific synthesis of a corporate scandal with astronomical metaphor and a daughter's fierce, logical defense. The use of "proof by contradiction" as a narrative method is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. The emotional truth of familial sacrifice elevates it beyond a simple plot twist.</comment>
