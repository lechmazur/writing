<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. His internal conflict is embodied through sensory triggers, and his final choice to grieve is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The emotional progression is realistic, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost ("tears traced paths... an acceptance"). The hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds: his actions are motivated, and sensory details accumulate to reweight the stake. The final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional bias. The UV apparatus and flower are integral to the climax, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: his UV experiment and the flower's bloom tighten options and deepen knowledge. The cost is legible in his tears and acceptance, foreclosing his previous avoidance with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory's impact emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the Somniflora revelation and Elias's grief. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., the vial's hidden word).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains within Elias's lexicon, and syntax reflects his state. The UV revealing method is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Minor deduction for slight overuse of "crystal" imagery ("crystal shadows," "crystalline splinters"), which creates a subtle template cadence but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief, scent, and extinction. Emotional truth is specific and avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the hybrid structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure feels inevitable.</comment>
