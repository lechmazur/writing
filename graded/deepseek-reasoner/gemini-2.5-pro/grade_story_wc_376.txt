<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his yearning for authenticity, intensifying from professional frustration to a profound obsession. His final choice to become a cultivator is earned by prior causality and forecloses his previous path with a visible, felt cost. The Silver-Vein fern is a brilliant externalization of his internal conflict, acting as a living barometer for his values. Embodied emotion is specific and avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. The plot unfolds via clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to obsession to action. Closure is a decisive change (DC) that is fully earned and lands on the page with visible cost ("he would not just be a calligrapher"). The zinc plate fragment is a perfectly kept setup that pays off causally at the vault door. Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city is not just backdrop; its artificial humidity warps the floorboard, revealing the map, and its toxic sky defines the stakes. The Silver-Vein fern and the Veritas seeds are micro-settings that directly constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's professional POV. The environment is a crucible, not a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly from professional frustration to a quiet obsession, culminating in the active choice to follow the map. The dominant stake (authenticity vs. dishonesty) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully with the discovery of the repository. The cost of his renunciation is legible on the page. Protagonist agency drives every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of authenticity vs. dishonesty emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the fern, the map, and the seeds. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by redefining the "treasure" not as a record but as potential, perfectly answering the central question without moralizing. The final image of planting the seed is a profound conceptual repricing (CR) that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elian's specific, professional worldview. The prose has a distinct, textured quality with a controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistent and character-specific, with a perceptual signature that notices through the lens of a calligrapher ("looping script," "gilded-leaf"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor artifact: the phrase "sweet poison on the recycled air" leans slightly toward a familiar metaphor, creating a small figurative muddle in an otherwise precise opening. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity are otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a calligrapher, a truth-sensitive fern, and a seed repository is a specific, non-obvious, and brilliantly inevitable combination. The core premise is wholly original and executed with full conceptual integrity, transforming familiar tropes (treasure map, dystopia) through grounded, lived detail. The risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
