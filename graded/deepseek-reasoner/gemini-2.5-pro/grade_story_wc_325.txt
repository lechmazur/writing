<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia is embodied and specific ("cold sweat...bead on his forehead"), and his motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is clear and intensifies under pressure. His final action of placing the gold fleck is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. The only minor deduction is for the claustrophobia being more a stated trait than a constraint that actively alters his tactics on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A strong Causal drive lens holds: the blocked corridor (therefore) forces the phase transition, which (therefore) enables the final act of closure. The ending is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost ("his chest feeling impossibly, blessedly open"). The orientation is immediate and the closure lands decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that pressures choice. The "concrete wound," "armored skins of defunct undersea cables," and the tidal timeframe are not just atmospheric but actively constrain tactics. The central hub and its console are key objects that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the physical obstacle forces a costly use of his ability. The dominant stake (granting peace) is clear and tightens meaningfully. The cost of his action is legible in the cleansing of the ghosts and his own emotional unburdening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of memory, duty, and technological failure. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor the forgotten. The gold fleck’s return is a perfect thematic action that completes the story without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elias's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("heat-shimmer distortions," "taste of ozone and granite"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the tension. The integration of technical and poetic language is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent sensory selection. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "crashing hush" is repeated, which, while likely intentional, slightly dulls the unique potency of its first use. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost-story sensibility with a sci-fi conceit (sentient data fragments) is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, avoiding cliché.</comment>
