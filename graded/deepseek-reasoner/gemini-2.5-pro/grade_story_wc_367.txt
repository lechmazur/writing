<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is clear and grand, intensifying under pressure. His manic laughter and trembling exhaustion are embodied and specific, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final realization of being shaped by the dawn is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his spent state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost in the final realization. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through density and a cadence shift that reweights the stake. The lens holds, though the causal linkage of the storm's energy is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its crystalline apparatus are the primary micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Kaelan's professional POV. The environment is fully integrated into the action, shaping the narrative's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaelan's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the storm's approach providing coherent pressure. The cost is legible in the white-hot wick and his trembling exhaustion. A single, meaningful tightening occurs as he weaves the chaotic energy, foreclosing other options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between creation and unintended consequence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of artistic control, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The prophetic element introduces meaningful ambiguity that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through Kaelan's expertise and ecstasy. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with rhythmic variation that heightens pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes perfectly with the scene's needs, supporting clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of lighthouse keeper and cosmic artist. The combination feels organic and inevitable, committed fully to its implications. Risk-taking in the high-concept setting and lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
