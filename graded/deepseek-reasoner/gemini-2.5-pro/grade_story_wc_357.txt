<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in action from the first paragraph. Her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., cutting the engines, using the drone) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned, though a touch more internal contradiction in the climax could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds throughout. The closure is a decisive change with clear, on-page cost ("she had only minutes"). The arrow tip's function and the time constraint shape tactics perfectly. The orientation is immediate and the ending reconfigures the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's greatest strength. The inverted river and floating cavern are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the action and POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens. The ticking clock of the inversion and the narrowing path through the arches create coherent pressure. The cost of the time constraint is legible and alters tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of "a gathering of echoes." The final image of the shard as a "memory of strength" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The subtext in the arrow's purpose is expertly handled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, professional filter. The prose is consistently lyrical yet precise. A very minor instance of potentially elevated diction ("whirling silence") prevents a higher score, but it is largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. The description of the Anechoic Heart is a peak beat that maintains clarity and propulsion. One minor loop ("silence" appears twice in close succession) prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of planetary inversion is brilliantly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of sci-fi and ecological allegory feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded details prevent it from being a generic template.</comment>
