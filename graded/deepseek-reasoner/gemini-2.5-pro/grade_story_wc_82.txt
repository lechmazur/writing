<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen's grief is embodied and specific ("the sorrow was a formless, heavy water"), and his final choice to fold a crane is earned by the preceding catharsis. A slight deduction for the "luminous torment" phrase, which edges toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory and emotional density. The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where grief transforms into a current; the cost is legible in the "agonizing, sacred moment" of transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The "descends while ascending" staircase and the glass basilica are not just backdrop but the very mechanism of the protagonist's emotional journey and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of memories and the physical act of gem polishing, which narrows Kaelen's emotional options until the final, inevitable release. The cost of this journey is felt in his white knuckles and the threat of shattered resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief transformed, not erased, is realized with profound emotional honesty through the specific, devastating contrast of Elara's dream against Kaelen's reality. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistently filtered through Kaelen's perception, with a lyrical, mournful rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, but a pattern of dense metaphor ("luminous torment," "powdered starlight") creates minor artifactual weight in peak beats, slightly obscuring the clean propulsion of the closure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording technology, origami, and a fragmented floating world is fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to, and the emotional risk-taking—embracing a broken promise as a source of strength—is exceptional.</comment>
