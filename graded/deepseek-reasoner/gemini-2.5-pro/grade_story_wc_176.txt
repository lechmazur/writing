<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian's characterization is deeply embodied through technically gentle hands and snowmelt ardor, with micro-choices under pressure (unbraiding, weaving) revealing his hierarchy of values. The final choice to sketch the sigil is earned by prior causality, though the "snowmelt ardor" metaphor slightly approaches diagnostic labeling at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sigil's projection reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and precise; the ceremonial rope's constraint shapes tactics throughout, and the cost of the ephemeral manifestation is legible in its dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacial ice sanctum and aurora are not merely descriptive but actively pressure the work (perpetual frost) and supply the illumination medium. The ceremonial rope is the quintessential micro-setting object, constraining every choice and decisively charging the final image with its projected light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a flawless density increase through the painstaking weaving process, driven entirely by Elian's agency. The cost is unmistakable: the sigil's fleeting existence is the visible price paid for this act of preservation, foreclosing a permanent recovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and forgiveness emerges organically from the specific action of weaving light, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the ghost of a ghost preserved in silver—that reweights the entire endeavor without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elian's perceptual signature ("a quiet peace," "surgeon’s precision"). The voice is distinct and controlled, with rhythmic prose that modulates with the intensity of the work. Purposeful compression (e.g., "Hours bled into one another") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("snowmelt ardor"), but it is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of wax caster, phosphorescent rope, and encoded memory is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully and executed with bold, specific choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar themes of loss into a singular vision.</comment>
