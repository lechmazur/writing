<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear, rooted in his role, and intensifies to compel the decisive prod. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("trembling precision," "quiet, certain joy"). The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the arbor's transformation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost (the arbor's awakening, Elian's transformation) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The lens holds as pressure builds through pattern accumulation until the final prod triggers the release. The cost is legible on the page ("ash began to flake away," "shimmering with a faint, residual light").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen arbor setting is essential, constraining choice (the sorting work) and charging the final image (revealing green wood). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Elian's professional POV. The micro-setting (sorting bench, monuments) functions as a crucial story element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in the deliberate prod. The cost is unmistakable on the page (the arbor's physical transformation). The dominant stake (decoding the message/restoring life) is signaled early and pays off with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through small, attentive acts emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("monumental power of the very, very small") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of Elian's shimmering hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistent and character-specific, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact message in the leaves) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A minor instance of template cadence ("He was... He was...") appears briefly but does not obscure closure or causality. Read-aloud quality is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ecological fantasy and myth. The combination of seed sorter, moonstone lore, and miniature monuments feels organic and singular. The final reconfiguration is earned and feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
