<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his cryptic profession, compelling his methodical actions. His infinite patience is a visible trait that enables his work, though his internal contradiction is subtle. The final choice to anchor the sound is a credible endurance, though its felt cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the town's potential restored. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through rhythmic and sonic density. The cost is legible in the "promise of return" and the keeper's ongoing duty, making the final image charged and undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and purpose. The archway, cobblestones, and tuning fork are not just described but are active, functional elements that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered entirely through Elias's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification of sonic and spectral density. The dominant stake of revival is signaled early and deepens as phantom footsteps multiply, reweighting the silence with palpable potential. The cost is the keeper's endless, patient labor, felt in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: revival through resonance, balance as rhythm. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the silence from "empty" to "filled with promise." It avoids moralizing, embracing the complexity of an endless, necessary maintenance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that mirrors the protagonist's method. There is no head-hopping, and the lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a resonant awakening"). However, there are no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, and clarity is never sacrificed, especially at the crucial closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of sonic ghost town revival is highly original and executed with authenticity. The synthesis of concept, character, and method feels inevitable and fully committed. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
