<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in specific artistic failure. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("luminescent ache"). The final transformation to a "cartographer of the fractured soul" is earned by the on-page process of redesign. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("vessel for nothing but absence") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the character reconfigures his perception of fragmentation into a navigable map. The cost is legible in the final image: the ache softens but remains, illuminating the work. The spiral pattern of the staircase and the new map provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining the character and supplying the crucial resources (threads, charcoal, charts) that enable his transformation. The environment is fully integrated into action and charges the final image, with the sweeping light acting as a metronome for his work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: navigating internal collapse. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—his decision to redesign, not mend, is the key tightening. The cost is the transformation of his pain into a "gentle, knowing glow," a felt price that charges the closure. Pressure coheres from the internal sense of walls closing in to the active, deliberate act of creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding order within chaos emerges organically from the specific particulars of the artist's failure and his method of "untangling threads." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the map, reweighting the premise of fragmentation without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the handling of the tarot cards and the spiral design.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("constellation of disconnected features"). The prose's rhythm and lyrical density are perfectly controlled and modulate with emotional intensity. The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in the phrase "vessel for nothing but absence," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak moment. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a portrait artist's crisis, a lighthouse library, and tarot fragments into a map of the soul feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform familiar tropes. The risk-taking in the accumulative, introspective structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, supporting the closure.</comment>
