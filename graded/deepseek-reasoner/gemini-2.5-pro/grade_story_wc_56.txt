<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in familial obsession, with embodied emotion ("hands trembled") and micro-choices under pressure (exchanging pole for hook). The final renunciation of seeking external validation for internal faith is earned by the journal's revelation, with visible cost in the serene upheaval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Kael's actions (poling, casting, prying) lead directly to the discovery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost felt in the "vast, yet utterly serene" upheaval. Orientation is immediate; the sundial's paradox is the central riddle paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the canal's "bruise"-colored water and the lockbox "shedding mud like a leviathan" charge the final image. The sundial and radio are micro-settings that constrain choice and tactics, deeply integrated into the causal chain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. familial disgrace) are signaled early and escalate through the radio's static deadline. Kael's agency in salvaging the box forces a decisive tightening, and the cost is legible in the serene upheaval of his reclaimed history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial lies emerges organically from the blueprints' revelation, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the sundial reweights the premise: truth is known, not seen. Subtext operates in the grandfather's riddle and the box's contents.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Kael's professional seeker lens ("tactile conversation with the mud"). Voice is distinct and consistent, with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("dead, unyielding weight of iron"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid without overwriting. Figurative language ("color of a day-old bruise") is purposeful and pattern-taught. Sentences advance story and atmosphere; no loops or scaffolds. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familial mystery and sensory-driven discovery. The sundial riddle and instinct-training method feel original and inevitable in hindsight. Trope of redeemed legacy is transformed through specific, grounded detail and moral complexity.</comment>
