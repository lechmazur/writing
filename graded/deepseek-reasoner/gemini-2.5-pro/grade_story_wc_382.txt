<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's obsession is concrete and drives escalating choices; her micro-choice to invite Elias to the rooftop demonstrates agency under pressure. Elias is a distinct, enigmatic presence whose traits constrain the relationship. The final renunciation of illusion for truth is earned by her accumulated learning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Clara accepts her new role as "librarian of whispers." The cost is legible in the final image of the spiral impression, a promise with tangible weight. Linkage through sensory lessons feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is the story's core; the building is a character whose details (groaning pipes, sun-bleached floor spot) actively teach Clara and constrain her understanding. The rooftop garden and meteor shower decisively pressure the final revelation, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Clara's need for truth, culminating in her direct interrogation on the rooftop. The dominant stake (understanding vs. illusion) tightens through her agency under the accumulative lens. The cost of shattered comfort is felt in the new, weightier truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, truth, and custodianship emerges organically from the building's whispers and the "agreed upon lies." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the spiral impression as a promise—that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that filters the world through Clara's obsession ("syntax of settling foundations"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying significant subtext in their silent tea sessions. Elision (Elias's nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("silhouette stitched from twilight") is precise and voice-motivated. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold obscure clarity, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept—a building's memory manifest as a human tutor—is a fresh, ingenious synthesis. It is executed with full commitment to its own logic and emotional truth, transforming a familiar ghost story trope into something singular and memorable.</comment>
