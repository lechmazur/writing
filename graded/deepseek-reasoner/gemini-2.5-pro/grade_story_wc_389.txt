<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving his final choice. His internal conflict between warring shadows is dramatized through contradictory voices. The final renunciation of spectral masters feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tired shoulders and the world's broken state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pressure building through layered prophetic fragments until the storm forces a climax. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian rejects both dooms, with cost legible in the "broken world" finally seeing sun. The map's discovery is slightly convenient but pays off through the cobalt glass filter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is indispensable, filtering perception and ultimately resolving the map's pattern. The stormlit observatory constrains every choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the portico's "bruised-indigo lens" and "pitted iron" spire creating a cohesive, pressurized environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping a new dawn) escalates through accumulating prophecies and the storm's dueling voices. Agency is clear in Elian's final broadcast rejecting both options. Cost is felt in the world's broken state and his role as a "fulcrum," with the storm's pause serving as a consequential deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between spectral control and human agency. The final image of sun "painting the broken world below in gold, not blue" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of allegiance. Subtext operates powerfully in the warring voices and the map's revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical prophetic voice that maintains consistency under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture ("tasted of ozone and regret") and perceptual signature. Some minor density in figurative language but no clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative density in phrases like "lyrically prophetic sorrow" creates slight decorative weight, but propulsion remains strong. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Closure image lands with clarity and power.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of storm-swept setting, prophetic themes, and spectral communication. The cobalt glass filter and starlight map are fresh, irreplaceable elements. Risk-taking in lyrical voice pays off with coherence. Premise feels wholly organic and fully committed.</comment>
