<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is superb, with clear motivation rooted in her disguised wisdom. Her micro-choices under pressure, like the decision to encode and transmit her findings, are fully earned by her established traits. The final beat of returning to her chair embodies a credible, charged endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise, crystallizing the stakes with undeniable cost felt in the final image of her waiting. The plot is tightly wound, with each beat—her suspicions, deductions, and the risky transmission—narrowing options logically and inevitably toward this tense, open-ended resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is not merely described but is a crucible that pressures choice, supplying the terminal and the calibration window essential to the plot's climax. The eternal candle's light is a recurring object that charges the final image, constraining her actions and defining the story's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes of a coup are signaled early and escalate through a single, powerful tightening: Elara's synthesis of clues forces the high-risk transmission. The cost is legible in the heart-stopping system lag and the final, tense wait, all driven by her agency under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories finding voice emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image. The silence is filled not with exposition but with the weight of her action, offering a complex answer about resistance through hidden knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's sharp, perceptive consciousness. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a rhythmic quality that heightens during the transmission sequence. No head-hopping or voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("ghost-stitch," "cloak of foolishness") is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift to obscure clarity, especially at the critical closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of an embroiderer charting a coup is a fresh, ingenious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.
