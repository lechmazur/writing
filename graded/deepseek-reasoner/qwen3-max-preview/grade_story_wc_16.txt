<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in restoring trust after the Great Silence, compelling high-stakes choices. Embodied emotion is strong, as seen when her hands shake during reconstruction. However, a slight lack of internal contradiction or contradictory impulses under pressure prevents a higher score, as her focus remains singular without significant internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with the singing ceremony, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the silence of awe replaces abandonment. The causal lens holds tightly from deciphering to performance. Cost is legible in the curator's tears and the trembling ink well, making the stakes felt and the resolution earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly rendered with sensory details (dust-laden air, humming ceiling) and constrains choices, as the rotunda's acoustics are essential for the climax. The glass ink well and chandelier recur with charged meaning, integrating setting into action and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust) escalates through her agency, from deciphering to conducting the song. Cost is unmistakable: the warning that breaking a promise shatters truth, and the physical reactions (chiming ink well, falling dust) heighten tension. The climax forces a trade-off with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of truth as performance, not declaration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of "scattered promises kept," avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the curator's warning and the ink well's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a scholarly yet passionate voice. Diction and syntax reflect her expertise ("vowel shift," "acoustic resonance charts"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven, as in the exchange with the curator. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("dust fell like snow") enhances without muddling. No loops, scaffolding, or artifactual issues. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of "symphonies of truth" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of linguistics and music, transforming the trope of dead languages. Risks heighten stakes, as the climax hinges on singing promises. Specificity in details (Syrathi glyphs, drowned monastery) anchors the vision authentically.</comment>
