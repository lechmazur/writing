<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice—releasing rather than reclaiming lost time—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The protagonist's "willingly perplexed" stance is a consistent, character-specific flaw that complicates her choices authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with profound cost, foreclosing the path of reclaiming the past. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with the final image of the whole saucer and the child's voice reweighting all prior material. The persistent constraint of grief's magnetism shapes the final, surrendered stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "midnight glade above clouds" is a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice and charges the final image, its thin, shimmering air a tangible representation of the protagonist's emotional state. The dolls' tea set saucer is a recurring object that constrains choice and is decisively reweighted at closure, qualifying for the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from summoning to a decisive act of surrender. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the image of her "unfastening her grip on what could not be held." A single, meaningful deepening—the realization that time must be released, not reclaimed—is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss through the final image of the healed saucer and the call from the porch. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the tracing ritual and the cracked saucer, resisting tidy morals and embracing the complex grace of surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control that modulates perfectly with emotional pressure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the cartomancer's consciousness, with purposeful elision (e.g., the specifics of the "syllables that tasted of storm") that pays off in the story's mystical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor instance of potential register drift in the phrase "choking beauty," but it is taught early and woven into the narrative's pattern, thus not penalized. Rhythm and syntax are masterfully controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy with a mother's grief feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept of "cloudbound repentance" is transformed from a thematic echo into a tangible, plot-driving force. The story commits fully to its high-concept premise and follows its emotional implications without retreat, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
