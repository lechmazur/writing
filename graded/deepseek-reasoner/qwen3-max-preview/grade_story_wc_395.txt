<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation evolves from archival curiosity to a resonant, obsessive hunt, compelling higher-stakes choices like lying and triggering the mass restore. Her internal contradiction—"she lied to herself"—is dramatized in scene, and her final renunciation as an anchor is earned by prior causality with visible cost in her perpetual, attentive listening. Embodied emotion is specific and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the keeper becomes the anchor for the lost, with cost legible in her daily ritual and the patch's hum. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with escalation driven by pattern recognition leading to the final, decisive act. The janitor beat is the only minor weakness, feeling slightly less integrated than the rest of the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and supplying the core concept. The patch and server racks are micro-settings that constrain choice and profoundly charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully filtered through the keeper's professional and obsessive POV, with the hum and warmth of drives becoming tactile, lived-in elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is masterfully driven by the keeper's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, from noticing the pattern to actively mapping it and finally triggering the restore. The cost is unmistakable on the page in her transformed role and the perpetual, sensed absence she now attends to. The dominant stake of finding the lost is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the convergence of event, image, and motif—the patch, the numbers, the silence—offering a resonant, non-literal answer about memory, loss, and digital ghosts. The final image of the keeper as an anchor is a profound Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing or stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through a professional archivist's obsessive lens. The voice is consistently controlled, lyrical, and precise, with rhythmic prose that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. Purposeful compression ("They were in the gaps.") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language ("resonance chamber," "unlinked from reality's index") is precise, coherent, and deeply integrated. Rhythm is masterful, varying naturally to support the accumulating tension and lyric resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of cosmic horror, digital archaeology, and corporate melancholy that feels both fresh and inevitable. The core concept of being "de-referenced" is a transformative, non-obvious angle on disappearance. The story commits fully to its premise, with bold risk-taking in its accumulative structure and quiet closure that heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
