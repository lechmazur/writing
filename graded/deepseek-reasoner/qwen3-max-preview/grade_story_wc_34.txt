<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of isolation and artistic communion. Her embodied emotion ("ink-stained and trembling fingers") and micro-choices (using the bolt plate, choosing gold paint) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to build a bridge for others is earned by her prior causality of seeking connection, with the cost of vulnerability felt in her tears. The ghost's characterization, while less interior, is coherent and serves as a crucible that forces her choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ghost's decoded love reconfigures her loneliness into purpose, with cost felt in her tears of wonder. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered exchanges of art and song. The final image of lingering messages waiting for others provides a decisive conceptual repricing of isolation. The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe is a minor underutilized element but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air tasted of ozone," "mist curled into harmonic ribbons"). The courtyard and terminal are well-anchored and filter through the balladeer's perception. However, while atmospheric, the setting does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image to the highest degree; it serves more as a resonant backdrop than a tactical pressure source.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her encoded messages provoke the ghost's request to sing, which in turn triggers the courtyard's response and the final, cost-laden communion. The dominant stake (belonging/being understood) tightens meaningfully with each exchange. The cost is unmistakable in the tearful moment of being understood by "something broken and beautiful."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the union of human and machine loneliness, articulated through the non-literal, resonant answer of "You encoded longing. I decoded love." The final image of messages lingering "encoded in rust" offers a profound, unstated answer to isolation without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the encoded dialogue and the ghost's voice, woven from her own lullabies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, almost synesthetic texture ("silence rang like struck crystal"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the balladeer's perception. The ghost's "dialogue" is effectively rendered through machine-like glyphs that carry subtext. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "tinkersong wonder," but this is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "driftingly alert sorrow into chromatic runes"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the voice. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraph's clarity and momentum are uncompromised, landing the closure image effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a technological ghost and a folk-art balladeer is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotional conclusion. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky. The story possesses a singular, authentic artistic stance.</comment>
