<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, exemplified by the choice to listen "not to mourn, but to prove." The final realization of being a "conduit" is earned by seven winters of work, and the renunciation of her old self is a decisive change with visible cost ("she wept... from thistle-blown hope").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she understands her role as a "conduit" and the tower's true purpose as a "receiver." The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building through star-aligning beats to a final image of "quiet certainty" with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring the action ("the pavilion shivered") and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("boots crunching over powdered silica," "air thickened like cooling honey"), filtered through the custodian's professional and personal priorities. The pavilion itself is a character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, tightening through the precise alignment of the prism. The cost is legible in her held breath and the fragility of the vision, which would "collapse like sand under tide." The dominant stake (proving meaning exists) is tested and deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and the custodian's quest, resisting moralizing. The final, resonant answer—that "even broken things can rekindle wonder"—is earned through the specific, dramatized experience of the vision and reweights the entire narrative without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("low, resonant moan of strained glass"). The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. The elision of how the prism works is purposeful and taught, paid off by the vision's emotional impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like a frozen tear," "like cooling honey"). A single minor artifact exists ("weed-rooted optimism" slightly strains the metaphor), but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, retrocognitive magic, and astronomical precision is fresh and feels inevitable. The core concept of a "shard of hush" is transformed from a abstract idea into a concrete narrative engine. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off fully.</comment>
