<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The guardian's dimensional homesickness is a concrete, embodied emotion that drives its choices, culminating in the earned renunciation of the pendant. Its final act of placing the pendant with the statue is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, foreclosing its solitary vigil with a visible cost. The internal contradiction between its feral nature and its longing for connection is sustained throughout, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through escalating sensory density and emotional weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the garden becomes porous. The closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of shared silence. The pattern of "interiorizing exteriors" is taught early and pays off decisively at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The frozen garden is not a postcard but a micro-setting that actively pressures the guardian's choices and charges the final image. Its geometry is literally swallowed, and its mist mutters in half-languages, constraining action and reflecting internal state. The environment evolves causally with the guardian's act, cracking open to become connective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency under the Accumulative lens, through its decision to wait and then to act, placing the pendant. The cost is legible on the page in the "hollow ache" of its vigil and the transmutation of its homesickness into a compass. The dominant stake of loneliness vs. companionship tightens meaningfully through this choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from the guardian's specific struggle, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: carrying uncertainty like a lantern. The core concept of "boundaries of light" is repriced from sharp edges to soft membranes through the protagonist's altered perception, avoiding any final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("glyphs that tasted like static and snow"). The voice is consistently poetic but remains anchored in the guardian's feral, archival consciousness. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the list of swallowed landscapes, but it serves the accumulative pattern and does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a feral librarian, dimensional homesickness, and a frozen garden is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through to its logical, emotional conclusion. The unconventional, quiet resolution heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
