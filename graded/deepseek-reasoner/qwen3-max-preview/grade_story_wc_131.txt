<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation is clear, profound, and consistently drives her micro-choices. Her final feeling of "warmth spreading through her ribs" is an earned emotional progression, a decisive change from her initial state of "slow erosion of soul." Her actions are perfectly aligned with her desire for resonant visibility, not spectacle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her new state of connection. The structure is a masterful two-shard sequence (crawl space -> library) that builds to a single, powerful closure unit. The final staff notice provides the on-page, felt cost of her previous isolation and the price of her new hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library setting is not just vivid but actively constrains and enables her choices, functioning as both haven and crucible. Key objects (tape reel, ribbon, key) are charged with meaning and directly shape the narrative's climax. The "sapphire hush" of the outage is a brilliant atmospheric detail that pressures her initial act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of sensory echoes and the stakes of her ritual. The dominant stake (visibility/connection) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens with each cached item. Her agency in placing the objects is the key turn that narrows her options and leads to the final, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and character actions, resisting any direct statement. The final image of her reading the notice, tears "streaking dust on her cheeks," is a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to the question of invisibility and connection. The story’s emotional aftereffect is potent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sensory, textual details. The prose rhythm is controlled and varies purposefully with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and perfectly advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("like a broken promise," "like light through stained glass") is precise, purposeful, and enhances clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise is strikingly original and executed with authentic vision. The synthesis of a crawl space dweller and an archivist of lost memories feels inevitable in hindsight. The unconventional structural choice (quiet, accumulative escalation) heightens stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
