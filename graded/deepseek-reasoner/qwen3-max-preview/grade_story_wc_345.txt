<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira's spectral altruism is a consistent, embodied motive, and the settlers' trust is earned through resonance, not command. However, her internal contradiction is stated ("no body, but carried purpose") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure, preventing a higher score. The final collective action is a credible endurance, but the cost is more felt for the community than for Elira herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the community's unified action forecloses their life in the orchard, visible in the "orchard sighed — not in loss, but in pride." The accumulative lens holds, building through chalk messages to the bell's ring. The pattern is taught early and pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The petrified root-veins, Glass Canopy, and seventh arch are not just vivid but actively shape the narrative's tactics and outcome. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and deeply integrated with the POV's spectral, observant nature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by collective agency under the accumulative lens, moving from noticing chalk to a synchronized ritual. The cost of leaving the thinning orchard is legible. The stake (survival vs. respite) is signaled early and meaningfully deepens, though the initial threat ("roots fraying") is more stated than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through potent, reweighted images—chalk, bell, nebula—offering a non-literal answer about collective trust and hope. The final image of the nebula as a "bridge" resonates without moralizing. The concept of "orchestration, not control" is fully integrated into the story's emotional and narrative logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, observant rhythm fitting a spectral POV. The prose successfully weaves description with action. A minor deduction for occasional dense, figurative phrasing in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a chime like liquid glass") that slightly obscures immediacy without being a major artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor line-level artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("spectral tears") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("beautiful and terrifying" / "silent, spectral, strangely trustworthy"). These do not, however, obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost orchestrating a community's exodus via chalk and a memory-bell on an orchard planet is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with specific, grounded detail that avoids cliché. The risk-taking with a non-corporeal POV heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
