<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in character, compelling high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("throat tight"). The final renunciation (keeping vigil, not archiving) is earned. A slight deduction for interior contradiction not being more actively dramatized in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost ("a farewell sung to an empty auditorium"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through layered imagery and a decisive cadence shift at 05:00. Orientation is immediate and the single-scene structure is flawlessly executed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The moonlit summit, regolith, and dawn light are not just described but are tactile forces that shape the protagonist's actions and the story's elegiac tone. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and perfectly filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is masterfully driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the live clock (04:57 to 05:00) creating immense pressure. The cost is unmistakably legible on the page in the final, unreceived message. The dominant stake (bearing witness) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully to its conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and character action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of legacy. The final image of the empty hourglass and the whispered line, "You outlasted them all," reweights the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's expertise. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, particularly in the climax ("a faint hiss, the last grain dissolving"). No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic variety. There is a single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("dawning hush deepened—not absence, but presence transformed") which slightly dulls an otherwise pristine closure image. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and clarity are superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, poignant angle on legacy and obsolescence. The synthesis of the hourglass mechanism with lunar science feels inevitable and deeply original. The story commits fully to its premise, with bold risk-taking in its quiet, contemplative resolution that heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
