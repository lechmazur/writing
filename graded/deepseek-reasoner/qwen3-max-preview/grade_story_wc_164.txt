<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's micro-choices under pressure are vivid and embodied ("fingers trembled not from fear but from delight"). Final renunciation—accepting mystery instead of solving it—is earned by the crater glass vision, with cost visible in her altered stance ("carry it... as adornments, not wounds").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-use intensifies to the crater glass vision, which delivers a decisive conceptual repricing (paths are "given away"). Closure lands with cost on-page: "wear the missing pieces as adornments, not wounds" reconfigures the premise. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The geode cave is not just vivid but constrains choice (she navigates crevices for seeds) and charges the final image (the exit where "dawn’s first light seeped through fissures"). Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through her recollectionist POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (discover why paths vanish) escalate under the accumulative lens via deepening revelations: from seed emotions to the crater glass's transformative vision. Protagonist's agency drives the escalation—her choice to touch the glass forces the final, cost-laden reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (loss as gift, mystery as sustenance) emerges organically from the crater glass revelation and the final image of "scattering conjectures like confetti." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("cheerful gloom, the paradox she wore like a second skin"). Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("emotion flooded her: not images... but pure feeling") slightly obscures causality but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a recollectionist role, emotional transliteration, and a geode setting feels fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
