<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the handling of the pendant and the viral confession. Motivation ("reclamation") drives micro-choices like the offering and placing the printout, with a clear hierarchy of values. The final stance of "becoming" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the act of transforming rather than erasing the past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught immediately and held throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as the character crystallizes her method of mending. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the pendant casting light on a path walked "unafraid," reconfiguring her relationship to the past.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is the primary crucible, actively constraining and enabling choice. The data center's decay ("moss-choked," "velvety floor") and the recurring object (pendant) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and actions, making the environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through a series of deliberate, quiet actions (offering, placing the confession) that deepen the stake of reclamation. The cost is felt in the final, proactive decision to return and bring seeds, foreclosing a path of mere hiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of image (icicle patterns, moss) and action (transforming the confession). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of healing through the final, charged image. Avoids moralizing; the wisdom is earned through specific, concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through a lens of "reverence" and "reclamation." The prose's lyrical, measured rhythm is voice-motivated and remains controlled under pressure. No head-hopping; the single consciousness is coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of figurative density exists (e.g., "cathedral of decay," "honeyed hush"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive lens. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; every sentence advances the narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a data center and a moss garden is a fresh, non-obvious angle on renewal. The core concept of "patient, quietly proactive tracing" feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
