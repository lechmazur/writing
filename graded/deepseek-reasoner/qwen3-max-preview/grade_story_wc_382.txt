<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with motivation intensifying from forgotten tutor to reciprocal communicator with the sentient building. The final choice to descend to the basement is earned by prior causality, with the key exchange serving as a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values. The "patiently nimble" trait is embodied in action, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (gaining the key and knowledge) that lands on the page with cost (the end of the agreed-upon lies, a new phase of truth). The inferred hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds, with the meteor shower and final sigh of the building charging the image. The persistent constraint of the building's sentience shapes the final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and basement vault are not just descriptive but constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("meteors streaked silently overhead, painting the sky with fleeting silver scars"). The setting is a character that pressures the protagonist's choices and supplies the ultimate resource (the vault).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, moving from borrowed sugar to the exchange of the seal and key. The cost is legible on the page in the shift from "agreed upon lies" to "truth, steeped and waiting." The dominant stake (learning the building's language) tightens meaningfully through this turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of communication and forgotten languages emerges organically from events and images (the seal, the whispers, the key). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of the sighing building awaiting her. Subtext operates powerfully in the weekly tea sessions built on half-truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through the tutor's linguistic sensibility. Dialogue is natural and carries significant subtext, advancing the plot through riddles wrapped in facts. The voice is consistent and controlled, even under the pressure of the revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for slight density in the opening paragraph ("dead as in retired, forgotten") and a near-paraphrase loop ("whispered warnings or welcomed rain"/"syntax in their mortar, grammar in their gables"). However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of a sentient building and a language tutor learning to communicate with it is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The concept of "agreed upon lies" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
