<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in specific guilt; interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "ink trembling like a newborn’s breath"). Final choice to use her own blood and sing is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the peak beat ("static dissolved into sighs" edges toward summary).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the machine's weeping and the father's final words provide a decisive change with clear, felt cost. The pattern of regret and sound is taught early and pays off impeccably at the end. No orientation debt; the who, where, and when are anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is a crucible that actively pressures choices and charges the final image (e.g., the machine's console, the amber). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the protagonist's professional and emotional priorities ("vacuum tubes throbbing with violet light"). The laboratory and its objects constrain tactics and are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a meaningful cadence shift (the machine forming words, the insect's transformation) that reweights the dominant stake of guilt and redemption. The protagonist's agency in pressing her arm to the amber and singing the lullaby drives the escalation and leads to a closure with a visible price (her blood, the new constellation).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of translating pain into something bearable emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The final image of the Cradle Major constellation offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of guilt and forgiveness. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication (e.g., the unspoken forgiveness in the father's final words).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently lyrical and specific to the character's worldview. There is no head-hopping. A very minor deduction for a single instance of potentially ornate phrasing ("static unraveled into yawns") that slightly softens the texture of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat with the parallel clauses "Static dissolved into sighs. Screams unraveled into yawns," which creates a slight template cadence and softens the impact of the closure moment. This prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing, haunted firmware, and lost sounds is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking in blending genres heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
