<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, embodied, and drives choices under pressure. The final renunciation of loneliness is earned through the firefly encounter, with visible cost in the palm-press gesture. Contradictory impulses (solitude vs. belonging) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the fireflies' open hand reconfigures belonging with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the pattern of emotional mapping pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely rendered and actively pressures choices—the cracked viewport and central observatory constrain and enable the climax. The environment charges the final image, with the facility's transformation from "haunted" to "inhabited" serving as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (seeking rhythm, pressing palm) under the accumulative lens. The fireflies' arrival constitutes a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake of belonging, with cost legible in the "long, slow release of tension."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the fireflies' gesture, reweighting prior material without statement. The burnt feather's transformation from "ending" to "beginning" is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("braille maps of drowned constellations"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor overwriting risk in phrases like "shadowseam wonder," but clarity remains uncompromised. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally original synthesis of oceanic and celestial imagery feels inevitable. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on belonging, executed with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The fireflies' aquatic adaptation is a masterstroke.</comment>
