<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elira's guilt and motivation are concrete and drive every choice. Her embodied reaction to the memory ("She vomited into the surf") is a peak moment of character under pressure. The final renunciation of her old trade is earned by the causal revelation. A minor deduction for a single instance of near-diagnostic summary ("now reduced to stitching lies") which is quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she reconfigures her purpose with the weight of understanding. The cost is legible on the page in her physical reaction and the dissolution of the carvings. The watch hand's syncing pulse provides a clean, causal linkage for the memory flood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shore and carvings are vividly specific and charge the final image, constraining her discovery. The cobalt terrace is evocative but functions more as a decorative bookend; its closure feel is told rather than shown through a constrained choice, preventing a 9+ score. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the Accumulative lens through the intensifying discovery process. The dominant stake (weight of truth) is tested and deepened by the protagonist's agency in sifting and pressing the watch to the carving. The cost of the revealed truth is viscerally felt and alters her entire worldview and future trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth, memory, and mercy is intricately woven through the core concept (sieved hush) and the protagonist's arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding as ballast, not absolution. The final lines ("Tempered regret...") crystallize the theme without moralizing, arising entirely from the dramatized experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, textured quality that remains consistent under pressure. POV is strictly bound to Elira, with perception perfectly filtering the world. The patterned, almost incantatory prose ("sieved hush") is taught early and pays off magnificently at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("stretched like a bruise"), never muddying clarity. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a "sieved hush" is highly original and executed with stunning specificity. The combination of genealogist, driftwood confessions, and a ticking watch hand feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The story takes bold risks with its lyric mode and earns them through coherent pressure and closure.</comment>
