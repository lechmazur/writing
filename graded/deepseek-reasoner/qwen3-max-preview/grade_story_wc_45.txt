<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her shrewdly innocent gaze," "pity had cracked her open"). The final choice to leave the tooth is an earned renunciation rooted in her consistent motive to understand and redeem, not to undo. A micro-choice (pressing thumbs into soil) reveals her hierarchy of values. The closure cost is felt in the final image of the tooth pulsing, a testament to her work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the pulsing tooth reweights the premise of stolen things becoming sacred, with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is masterful, anchoring who, where, and when within the first sentence. The structure is a single, coherent scene that deepens through pattern and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The secret garden is indispensable, a micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image. Its paradoxical nature ("clocks ticked backward") constrains the protagonist's method of "bone setting." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("smelled faintly of cinnamon and ozone"). The environment evolves with the action, culminating in the hedges themselves "learning to forgive."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens. Her act of "bone setting" is a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake of redemption, moving from personal understanding to a communal offering. The cost is legible on the page in the final beat, where the cleft in certainty "remained—it always would—but now it breathed," a visible price paid for a new, fragile hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The core concept of recomposing the past ("turn mistakes into constellations") is integrated through specific, concrete actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief through the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent gaze," "syllables that tasted of salt and honey"). The prose has a singular, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density ("a nostalgic innovation, as if time itself had been gently rewired"). Rhythm varies naturally and supports the accumulative drive. A minor instance of elevated diction ("nostalgic innovation") is voice-motivated and does not clash. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the changeling myth through a lens of redemption and "bone setting." The perspective is memorable and specific, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical style that heightens stakes and coherence. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its implications without retreat. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
