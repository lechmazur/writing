<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through her tactile interactions with the orris root and the land. Her motivation is bottomless yet simple, compelling her higher-stakes choice to sanctify the cottage's departure. The final choice of renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with a visible, felt cost as the cottage "finally unclenched its ghostly fingers."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the sanctification ritual culminates in the cottage's release, with cost legible in the "hushed blaze" in her chest and the bay's deepened lullaby. The lens holds without contradiction, and a persistent constraint—the need to honor what is lost—shapes the final, potent image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a character that pressures choice; the "moss-slick stone" and "evening dew" provide the tactile, specific stage for the sanctification ritual. The orris root itself functions as a micro-setting, a recurring object that constrains her choice (she must place it intentionally) and decisively charges the final image as it glows with "presence" and then dissolves. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly filtered through her particular, reverent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the ritual's hush deepens, the bay stills, and the houses stir in the periphery, culminating in the focused pulse of the specific cottage. This pressure is driven by her agency—the deliberate placement of the shard—and the cost is unmistakable on the page in the "warmth bloom[ing] in her chest" and the cottage's release. The dominant stake (to honor the forgotten) is meaningfully tightened through this single, powerful act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core action: sanctification through displaced objects as an answer to creeping normality. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"not to preserve, but to honor"—that reweights the entire narrative, transforming the protagonist's motivation from observation to active, sacred participation. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of the orris root dissolving, its sanctification lingering in the environment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply internal, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature; her way of noticing ("silence pooled like spilled ink") is character-specific and consistent. The prose's lyrical, measured rhythm modulates perfectly with the ritual's pressure, accelerating with the houses stirring and crystallizing in the final, declarative paragraphs. There is no head-hopping; the voice is a singular, compelling perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor figurative strain exists: "silence pooled like spilled ink" slightly muddles auditory and visual senses, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs without becoming sluggish. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a "creeping normality noticer" who sanctifies thresholds with displaced objects—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of mystical ritual and psychological observation is organic, not a checklist, executed with a singular artistic stance. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
