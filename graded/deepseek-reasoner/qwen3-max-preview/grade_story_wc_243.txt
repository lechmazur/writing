<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice (to witness and transcribe) is a credible Earned Stasis, foreclosing the path of mourning with a visible cost of perpetual labor. The only minor flaw is a slight tendency toward diagnostic articulation in the "haunted euphoria" line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with felt cost: the archivist's renunciation of mourning for perpetual witness-work. The final image of her walking home beneath a starrring sky reconfigures the stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The jetty, lanterns, and locket function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and personal priorities. The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a decisive cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (preservation vs. loss). The archivist's agency—the choice to write—deepens the knowledge of the covenant's regeneration and narrows her options to a life of dedicated witness. Cost is legible in the finality of her renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how covenants regenerate through small, proximate acts. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly in the closing image of the starrring sky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The prose has a singular texture in word choice and syntax, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exemplary line-level craft with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final line resolves with an image that recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a "regenerated covenant" offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on memory and preservation, synthesized through specific, grounded choices. The combination of archivist, walnut ink, and covenant feels organic, not checklist-driven. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
