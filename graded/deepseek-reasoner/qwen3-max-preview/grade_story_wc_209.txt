<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her soul etched with light only darkness could reveal"). The final choice to create the mural is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her altered state. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction in peak beats that slightly distances the POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the page with felt cost ("her heart heavier with purpose"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building meaning through layered discoveries. The persistent constraint of the hidden layers shapes the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cathedral window, functioning as micro-setting, critically constrains the protagonist's choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through a professional artist's POV. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening as she decodes the window. Cost is legible on the page in her weeping and altered purpose. The dominant stake (understanding the nocturnal miracle) is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the mural and the real flowers. Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The conceptual repricing of beauty and obscurity is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture. Minor deduction for a slight register drift in the climax ("quiet thunder of understanding"), though it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly controlled with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the phrase "quiet thunder of understanding," a mixed metaphor that slightly obscures sense in a peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic pursuit, theological inquiry, and botanical mystery feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative, contemplative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
