<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's stoicism and sensitivity are embodied in her actions (cradling the doll, weeping silently) and micro-choices (using the last ink, sealing the letter). Her final "clarified" state is earned by her ritual and the emotional cost of discovering the bride's letter, foreclosing a path of pure documentation for one of shared grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara is "clarified," and the pavilion now holds a "new stratum" of "witnessed absence." The cost is legible in her empty inkwell and the townsfolk's whispers, proving her work has altered the place's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is the primary constraint, pressuring every action. Vivid, purposeful sensory details ("brackish water," "crusted barnacle-crowns," "slick, algae-streaked steps") are filtered through Elara's professional and emotional perspective. The setting charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the increasing emotional weight of each note and the discovery of the copper tube, culminating in Elara's tears—a decisive internal shift. The dominant stake (preserving memory against oblivion) deepens with each find, and the cost is her emotional expenditure and the empty inkwell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and witness emerges organically from Elara's actions and the specific, concrete details of the notes. The final image of her as a "priestess" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to grapple with absence, reweighting her initial motivation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, melancholic voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("half-swallowed by brackish water and memory") that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; the voice is consistently character-specific and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single instance of potential overwriting ("half-swallowed by brackish water and memory" could be seen as a slightly mixed metaphor) prevents a higher score, but it is a minor, hairline slip that does not harm closure or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of an "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar themes. The choice to use notes and inkwell as the primary tools of action feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The story commits fully to its singular, poetic premise.</comment>
