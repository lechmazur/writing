<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("fingers trembled—not from fear, but from recognition"). The final choice—writing "I see you" on the mirror—is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values and is earned by prior causality, culminating in a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the mirror scene, which reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of decoding tapestries escalates density and pressure, culminating in a decisive on-page image where cost is legible ("choosing to carry it lightly").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the platinum labyrinth functioning as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects POV urgency. A minor deduction for slightly over-written description in the opening paragraph ("cobblestones held their breath"), which trends ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency through the decoding action, which deepens and reweights the dominant stake (self-forgiveness). The cost is unmistakable on the page in the mirror beat, and the final release of the village's sorrow is a direct consequence of her winnowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the recurring motif of threads and weaving. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness through the final image of the labyrinth's purpose shifting, without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Some minor register drift occurs in the opening lines ("cobblestones held their breath"), but it is consistent with the story's lyrical mode and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor figurative muddle appears in the opening paragraph ("cobblestones held their breath"), which slightly obscures clarity. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chess tutor's psychology with a time-frozen labyrinth is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "woven hush" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, and the story commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>
