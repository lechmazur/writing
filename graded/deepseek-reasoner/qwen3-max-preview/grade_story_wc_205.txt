<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The defunct revolutionary’s internal contradiction—storming barricades versus whispering sonnets to dust motes—is embodied and concrete. His final choice to collaborate with Voss and his realization that he "fought the wrong war" is earned by his prior, obsessive decoding work, with the cost of his former ideals felt in his weeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing a new purpose and collaboration. The cost is legible in his weeping "for possibility" and the final haiku. The lens holds, with the pattern of glyphs and stillness intensifying to a decisive shift in knowledge and stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid salon and the visible time-streams are vividly rendered and purposefully filter through the protagonist's poetic, regretful POV. The crystal shard and covered mirrors are micro-settings that directly constrain his choices and charge the final, triumphant image of transcription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in devising his method and collaborating with Voss, under the Accumulative lens. The stakes intensify from personal regret to a shared, vital reimagining of civilization. The cost is the tangible loss of his old revolutionary purpose, traded for a new, quieter rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between revolution and archaeology, erasure and remembrance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "real rebellion was against forgetting." The final haiku reweights the entire premise, transforming the method of covering mirrors into a profound philosophical statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized by a poetic, mournful idiom that remains consistent under pressure. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythmic flow. Dialogue, though brief, is natural and carries significant subtext, as in Voss's admission: "You’re mourning in a language the universe forgot how to speak."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward ornate phrasing ("gilded ruin," "fossilized starlight"), but it remains voice-motivated and never obscures causality or the powerful closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque asteroid, visible time, and an archaeological dispute feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to, with the poetically inclined revolutionary providing a singular, memorable perspective. The risk of high-concept lyricism pays off by heightening the stakes and thematic coherence.</comment>
