<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits; interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in her handling of the snow globe. The final choice to place the globe is a credible renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost, earned by prior causality. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong, with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the sigh of release and the fading of dreams. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through dream fragments to a decisive reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, woven through action and perception. The environment subtly mirrors internal states and evolves causally with events, such as the ice "remembering" and reforming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the analysis of dream cameos and the final act of placing the globe. The cost is legible on the page—the release sigh and the fading of dreams—foreclosing a path with visible consequence. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the "windows of connection" concept, which offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and protection. Subtext operates in implication and gesture, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., dream fragments) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it. Syntax and rhythm vary naturally, accelerating and breathing in step with scene needs. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ghost whispering and dream analysis, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity, and the concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
