<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the opening's "obsidian wind" memory pain and the tactile "texture of a feather" guiding her. The final choice to welcome the past is earned by the ritual's progression, with visible cost in the stone's dissolution and her arrival. Contradictory impulses of seeking home while fearing memory are present in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she arrives in a home she has "seeded," with undeniable cost in the stone's fulfilled purpose and her ceased flinching. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the mountain's breathing architecture reinforces the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is a masterclass in micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the finale. Its groaning shelves and shifting corridors actively pressure her ritual. The lost language stone and raven's feather are not just described but are indispensable tools that shape the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her urgent, tactile perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deliberate ritual act of seeding. The cost is legible in the stone's cracking and her final, earned arrival. The dominant stake of finding home is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's progression, culminating in a reconfiguration of her relationship to memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery, culminating in the profound, non-literal realization that "Home was not a place... but a frequency." The final image of the stone, stilled and "lived," offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the dissolving feather and the mountain's thunderous acknowledgement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in the seer's distinct perceptual signature, with a lyrical, textured voice that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, sustaining pressure without obscuring clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift, even at the peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing propulsion or clarity. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and pays off at closure ("like rain on thirsty soil"). Rhythm is varied and supports the accumulating pressure. There are no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a labyrinthine bookstore, a mercury-glass seer, and a lost language stone feels organic and fresh. The core concept of "seeding" a home via texture is a non-obvious, ingenious angle on belonging. The piece commits fully to its singular artistic stance, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical density that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
