<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("shoulders aching, throat tight"). A meaningful endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with felt cost. The final choice to request Tunnel 12 is a credible micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost on the page ("The city may ignore her findings... but the tunnel remembers"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through layered memories. A minor deduction for the worker's death revelation feeling slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized, but the closure effect remains strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV bias. The tunnel and lantern function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details evolve causally. The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using the lantern to deepen knowledge. Cost is legible on the page through the worker's death and the protagonist's etched forearm. A minor deduction as the empirical method's mechanics could be more integrated into the pressure, but the dominant stake tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and progress. Subtext operates powerfully in implication ("Ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage"). The core concept of entangled memories is fully integrated into the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity while maintaining consistency. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and rhythm, reflecting the mind of the focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Minor deduction for occasional filter verbs ("she realizes") that slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, but no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of historical trauma and investigative procedural feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in structure and perspective heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
