<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession with "the architecture of absence" is a concrete, character-particular motive that drives every on-page choice. Her final decision to enter the night she charted is an Earned Stasis, a renunciation foreclosing a path with visible cost, earned by decades of prior listening. Embodied emotion is strong, as in "her bare feet pressing into cold, salt-crusted stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she enters "the territory she had just charted," reconfiguring the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building meaning through summarized silences. The cost is legible in the final image of her vanishing, leaving only an "echo of summarized silence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is not a postcard; it actively pressures her choice and cradles her solitude, constraining the action. The "flaking gold leaf booklet" functions as a micro-setting, its physical state charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered entirely through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens: the act of summarizing silence intensifies the textual density and reweights the dominant stake of mapping the night. The cost is unmistakable in her final sigh and descent, a meaningful tightening that forecloses other options. Pressure coheres and grows until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of mapping the unspeakable emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the "labyrinth of quiet." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, avoiding any final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in phrases like "silence not empty, but dense with memory, like honeyed resin." The lyrical, compressed prose is entirely voice-motivated and pattern-taught, with no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm remain controlled under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats, e.g., "its brittle pages whispering against her palms like moth wings brushing glass," though the pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; every sentence advances atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of summarizing silence is a singular, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of oracle, cartography, and silence is organic and transformative, not a checklist. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a fully authentic vision.</comment>
