<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear, rooted in ancestral defiance and a need to mend silence. Her micro-choices under pressure—choosing to sew memory into stone rather than simply weave—reveal a concrete hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her labor felt in the canyon's response and the plate's transformation. A slight abstraction in her "hauntingly optimistic" trait prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through sensory density and ritual repetition. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mended plate pulses with life and the canyon begins to remember how to sing, reconfiguring the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. The ancestral gravity of her sleepwalking paths provides impeccable causality for her arrival and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth is not merely described but actively constrains and guides the protagonist's choice of where to kneel and mend. It supplies the resonant stone and the buried bell that responds to her actions, directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite, selective, and wholly filtered through her particular, mythic perception of the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative intensity of the sewing ritual, each stitch raising the stakes by pulling more forgotten echoes from the canyon. The cost is legible in the release of "drowned lullabies" and the tangible warming and animation of the plate. Her agency is absolute, a renunciation of her usual weaving for this higher-stakes act of reclamation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from action and image: the plate's fractures become the story's spine, and the concept of "broken precedents" is transformed into "sacred blueprints" through the specific, arduous act of sewing. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer on the map held by shattered things, resisting moralizing and sitting in complex, earned optimism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices "dust that tasted of forgotten hymns" and "moon-pale intuition." The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with the ritual's intensity. The single POV allows for a sustained, hypnotic rhythm that perfectly supports the accumulative drive lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly figurative but maintains clarity and propulsion, with sentences that advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Rhythm is controlled and varied, suited to the ritualistic pace. A minor tendency toward stacked modifiers ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") and synonymous phrasing ("ruin to reverence") in peak beats prevents a higher score, though closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaver, mender, and sleepwalker into a single archetype feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of sewing memory into stone is a breathtaking, non-obvious risk that fully commits to its own logic and pays off at closure. The story possesses a singular artistic stance, transforming its mythological components into a specific and unforgettable vision.</comment>
