<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is profound and specific, with embodied contradiction ("violence folded away, not forgotten") and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final choice to give the child a cutting is a perfect Earned Stasis, though the on-page cost of her renunciation is more conceptual than viscerally felt, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern and cadence. A minor deduction for the lens not being fully taught in the opening; the "tower fell" backstory is slightly oblique, creating a small orientation debt that is later resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and function. The glass dome, ballast sand, and rose thorns are not just descriptive but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's unique perception ("the grief in a root’s curl").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through the visits of the scavenger and the child, each deepening the stakes of Elara's mission. The cost is more implied than overtly visceral, but the final interaction with the child serves as a meaningful tightening that reweights her choice with greater consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from image and action, avoiding direct statement. The core concept of "weaving continuity" is answered with a resonant, non-literal final image of the child leaving "with dirt under her nails and something like peace in her step." The integration is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature ("petals unfurling in slow, silent prayer"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's consciousness. The lyrical style is taught from the first line and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances character or atmosphere. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The final line is a perfect example of textural specificity and propulsion serving emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, pacifist philosophy, and horticultural focus is fresh and organic. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the specific, grounded choices (using ballast sand as soil) elevate it beyond a simple trope inversion. A bold risk that fully coheres.</comment>
