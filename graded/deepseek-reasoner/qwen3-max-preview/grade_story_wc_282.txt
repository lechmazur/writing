<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her bare feet brushing damp stone," "pressed it to her chest... for calibration"). The motivation is clear and existential, intensifying to compel a higher-stakes choice at the climax as she shifts from observer to participant. The final choice to become an instrument is earned by prior causality, with the cost of the fossil's dissolution serving as a visible price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly established and held, building pressure through sensory density and pattern until the final Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and functional. Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost (the dissolved fossil) and a decisive change in the protagonist's purpose, moving from "solitary" to integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively pressures the protagonist's choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action ("bioluminescent lichen that responded to emotional heat"). The elm leaf fossil, a key object, constrains her actions (calibration) and is central to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates coherently through a density increase of sensory and emotional data, culminating in the fossil's activation. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation—her decision to lay the fossil down and respond by singing with her biothermal output is a decisive, high-stakes choice that narrows options and leads to the transformative climax with a clear cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of transitional objects and the act of translation, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and voice, reweighting the premise through the image of the fossil dissolving into motes of light carrying human feeling. It is a profound, earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through the protagonist's unique perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical texture in word choice and syntax. The voice modulates with emotional intensity ("the walls pulsed with warmth") and remains consistent under peak pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the non-auditory, thermographic voice) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical yet maintains clarity and propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught, avoiding muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for a potential register elevation in "pure affect," though it is largely voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise is strikingly original, synthesizing post-human sci-fi with lyrical emotion mapping into a singular, inevitable whole. The specific, grounded execution—heat-mapping emotions, transitional objects—feels authentic and fully committed, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
