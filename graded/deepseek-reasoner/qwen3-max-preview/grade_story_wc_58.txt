<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear, specific, and intensifies through their act of writing, compelling a high-stakes choice in the final renunciation. Contradictory impulses of grief and preservation act simultaneously in scene, embodied in the tactile detail of the thread and the act of folding the crane. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with a visible, felt cost of perpetual, lonesome mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the traveler's stance of mapping absence as a form of presence. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift into the final, resonant image. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's "quiet, lonesome splendor" and the act of leaving the crane. The persistent constraint of the thread's memory shapes the final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's melancholic bias. The garden and thread are well-integrated into action and theme. Minor deduction: while the thread charges the final image, the garden itself, though atmospheric, does not decisively constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is more a stage than an active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification through the final cadence shift, reweighting the dominant stake of mapping absence into a form of presence. The cost of this orientation is legible in the final, lonesome image. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through the act of writing and the final, renunciatory choice to leave the obituary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of mapping absence to make the gone present emerges organically from events and images, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the crane and the reconfiguration of mapping as an act of preservation. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (the thread's pulse, the folded crane) and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature and exquisite rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's specific consciousness. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact contents of the obituary) is taught and paid off by the final, resonant description of its purpose. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density, zero loops or scaffold, and masterful figurative language that consistently advances sense and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Read-aloud quality is superb. No figurative muddle in peak beats; every image is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief, cartography, and memory. The combination of elements feels organic and singular, not a checklist. The emotional truth and human complexity are paramount, executed with high specificity and authenticity of vision. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
