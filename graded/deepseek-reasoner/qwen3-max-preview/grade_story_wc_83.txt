<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation is a compelling, original blend of trauma and cartography, rooted in concrete memory ("Marta, the bridesmaid who sang off-key"). Her calibrated desperation is a credible, embodied response to loss. The final choice to "dive into the pools" is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing on vengeance for a more complex, costly pursuit. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of her goal ("to prove that potential doesn't die"), which trends toward theme statement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Structure is a masterful, coherent Accumulative/Textural build from memory to simulation to final leap. The closure is a potent Charged Poise, crystallizing her commitment to the hunt with the thruster ignition and whispered names. The inferred lens (Accumulative) holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the density of resonant images and the geode's pulses. The cost is legible in her "brittle, broken" smile and the bleak certainty of her pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating observatory is indispensable, a "Cradle of Cold Eyes" that pressures her isolation and provides the tools for her quest. The geode itself functions as a micro-setting, its "intangibly tangible" properties constraining and enabling her actions. Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful, from "magnetized boots" on steel grating to starlight refracted into "spectral grids." The setting actively charges the final image of leaping into the dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are powerfully signaled: the hunt for meaning in the wake of erasure. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through the intensifying simulations and the resulting coordinates, each a meaningful tightening. The final agency—queuing thrusters toward a point of "emptiness"—is a decisive act that forecloses other paths. Cost is felt in the simulation collapses "saturated with grief" and the overloaded circuit breakers, making the pursuit visibly costly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: that meaning, however fractured, must be actively salvaged from catastrophe. The geode is a brilliant motif that transforms from a found object into a vessel for spectral imprints, reweighting meaning at the end. The piece resists tidy resolution, ending on a note of bleak exhilaration and pursuit. The final image of "pooling in the hollows between seconds" is a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptional, a distinct perceptual signature blending technical precision ("perturbation theory") with poetic, trauma-tuned perception ("whispering in frequencies only trauma-tuned nerves could interpret"). POV is stable and deeply embodied. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is flawless, modulating from quiet defiance to the exhilarated leap. The Choir AI's dialogue is brief, functional, and tonally consistent with the cold observatory setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is pristine, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistently sharp and purposeful ("like a wound turning in its sleep"). Rhythm is expertly varied, accelerating with the final sequence. The read-aloud test is passed perfectly, with a compelling cadence that supports the Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept sci-fi (perturbation theory mapping human possibility) with deep emotional trauma is original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "unfiltered awakening" is fully committed to and followed to its logical, bleakly exhilarating conclusion. The geode is a fresh, non-obvious device that avoids cliché. The story takes bold risks with its lyric, accumulative structure and lands them with masterful coherence.</comment>
