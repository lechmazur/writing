<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mapper's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied choices like aligning the viaduct with the moon. Her internal contradiction—sculpting patience from impatience—is dramatized, not summarized. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost ("Their confusion would be her first victory").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as her patience transforms the viaduct and disarms the regime. Cost is legible on-page in the final image of her kneeling on ice, whispering thanks. The pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. The magnetic viaduct and frozen lake are tactile, lived-in environments that shape her tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV ("its iron bones gleaming under a sky still bruised with storm memory"). The basalt sanctuary actively holds her like a vow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening pattern of her rituals. The cost is unmistakable as her quiet revolution spreads through "contagion," disarming others not by force but by wonder. The dominant stake (transformation through patience) tightens meaningfully, foreclosing the old compulsions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The core concept of a "patient revolution" is integrated through specific actions like tracking moon paths. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing ("the revolution was never meant to end — only to deepen").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet purposeful, modulating with pressure. Diction remains within the mapper's plausible lexicon, and the elision of direct dialogue is a purposeful choice that serves the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle. There are no loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates with the thaw, yet remains precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of revolution and patience. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking in its quiet, accumulative design. The specific, verifiable detail ("a brass sextant older than the regime") creates authenticity without quirk.</comment>
