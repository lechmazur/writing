<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the act of stitching. The final transformation from "crestfallen" to "crestRISEN" is earned by prior causality—her descent into darkness and the physical act of stitching. The motivation "to descend into necessary darkness" is dramatized through her choices, though the final epiphany leans slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the lighthouse groans, the sea suspends, and the walls cocoon her in a "luminescent ache of transformation." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library and lighthouse are not just backdrop; they pressure choices and supply resources (scattered cards, books that appear). The setting constrains and enables her action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her crisis-narrowed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to stitch fragments intensifies the pressure, leading to the library's transformation. The cost is legible in the "luminescent ache" and the groaning lighthouse. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient and present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of stitching fragments to find wholeness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her rhetorical questions through the final image of her painted self, "wings made of stitched parchment." Avoids moralizing or thematic summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. Minor risk of figurative density in high-pressure beats ("laugh then—a sound like wind through broken glass") but remains legible and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor instances of stacked modifiers ("luminescent ache of transformation") border on overwriting but do not obscure closure. Overall, high information density with clear propulsion and no loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a portrait artist, tarot, and a lighthouse library feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "fragmented reality" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
