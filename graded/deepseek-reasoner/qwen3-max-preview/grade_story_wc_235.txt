<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure ("ink-stained fingers trembling at 3 a.m."). The final choice to write the jealousy is a decisive change earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for the "getting jealous of past selves" line, which borders on diagnostic self-awareness in a peak beat, slightly flattening the raw emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of soaring "through" reconfigures the chaos into a shaped, named entity with undeniable conceptual cost. The lens holds perfectly from the opening sensory accumulation to the final, purposeful reweighting of the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll is a micro-setting that evolves from a resistant object to an absorbed narrative, decisively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception, reflecting the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from passive flight to active hunting of past selves. The cost is legible on the page in the darkening scroll and the final, smaller grave. A single, powerful tightening—the decision to write the raw jealousy—narrows options and forces the final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of taming chaos, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the specific struggle with the scroll and the encounters with past selves, embracing complexity and ambiguity ("Endings are just seams").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and impeccable rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently sharp and particular, with purposeful compression and elision that is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and the prose-as-character is executed flawlessly, with syntax reflecting the narrator's fractured state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent ("a tune I wrote drunk on cheap wine and cheaper hope"). Sentence-level propulsion is perfectly calibrated to the emotional rhythm, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory, identity, and craft. The core concept of "feral nostalgia" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
