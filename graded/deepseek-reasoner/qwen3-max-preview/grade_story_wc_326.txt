<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, compelling motive of retrieval. The porcelain shard as a grounding totem is a brilliant micro-choice that reveals character under pressure. The final stance of endurance is earned, though the line "not saved, but settled" edges toward diagnostic summary at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost: "Wisdom... was in the honoring of its residue." The persistent constraint of his erased identity shapes his final, quiet departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is a masterclass in micro-setting. It is not just described but actively constrains and enables the action, its frost and silence becoming the literal and metaphorical medium for the defragmentation process, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: his choice to initiate the defragmentation sequence is the single meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in the final, settled hum of the servers and his quiet, resolved departure from a world that buried him.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding wisdom in failure's residue emerges organically from the core concept and character action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise through the final image of arranged, settled ghosts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is masterfully controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. The patterned, lyrical elision ("not saved, but settled") is taught and pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft. Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive without a single loop or artifact. Figurative language is consistent and purpose-driven, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. The final paragraph is a model of rhythmic, conclusive cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of cosmic and bureaucratic horror. The core concept of digital ghosts is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The specific lived detail of the porcelain shard and heartbeat counting elevates it beyond a clever premise.</comment>
