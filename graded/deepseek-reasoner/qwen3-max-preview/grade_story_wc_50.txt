<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear, rooted in preservation of wonder, and intensifies through his meticulous actions. His peripheral focus and reflective nature are embodied in his methods, with micro-choices (e.g., collecting shards by emotional temperature) revealing his values. The final renunciation (leaving the cavern without looking back) is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in the sealed archive's silent readiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing: the cavern becomes a "larder for the soul," reweighting wonder as a nutrient. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through light angles and discoveries to a final image of preserved echoes. Cost is legible in the locksmith's departure and the travelers' unintended offerings, affirming the stakes without explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, constraining choices (light angles, condensation) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the locksmith's expertise (e.g., quartz veins pulsing rhythmically). The setting evolves from a broken mechanism to a preserved archive, with spatial choreography clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the locksmith's agency under the Accumulative lens, with discoveries (glyphs, pulses) deepening the stakes of preservation. Cost is felt in the shattered stalactite and his deliberate, unrewarded labor. The dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens through his incremental actions, though the pressure remains contemplative rather than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (light, angles, resonance) and the locksmith's actions, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question of preserving wonder, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication, as in the travelers' unknowing offerings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on periphery and light. Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity (e.g., "elusive, toxic if grasped too directly"). Syntax and rhythm reflect the locksmith's meticulous, reverent mindset, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "harvest of echoes" crystallizes emotionally). No loops or scaffolding; sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, as in the final image of "glimmers" and "resonance."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes through light angles is highly original and fully integrated. The synthesis of physics and poetry feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightening stakes. Specificity (e.g., emotional temperature of shards) avoids generic templates and reinforces the singular artistic stance.</comment>
