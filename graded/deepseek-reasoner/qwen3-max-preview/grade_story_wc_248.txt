<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like fingers brushing glyphs and weeping from recognition. The final choice to step into the light is earned by a clear motivational arc from arsonist to archivist, with a visible cost of societal misperception. Contradictory impulses of destroyer/savior act simultaneously, creating a complex, flawed individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (stepping into the light) and a resonant reconfiguration (becoming the archivist of the unspoken) with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through patterned discoveries (glyphs, tapestry, creations). The final cost is legible in the line "The world above still thought her a criminal."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive is not a passive backdrop but an active participant that responds to her—glyphs glow, doors sigh open. It constrains and enables her search, and its "volcanic tenderness" (destruction that preserves) directly charges the final image and thematically mirrors her soul. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her analytical intuition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens—each artistic creation intensifies the pressure and elicits a response from the archive, narrowing her path to the final chamber. The cost is her total commitment to a mission that defines her, legible in the binding of "bloodline to artifact" and the final societal misperception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "volcanic tenderness"—destruction for preservation, memory as a fire to be kept alive. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question through the final image of her as "archivist of the unspoken," reweighting her prior actions without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in the protagonist's analytical, poetic perception. The voice has a distinct, rhythmic texture ("petrified ink and salt—volcanic tenderness") that modulates with emotional intensity yet remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact nature of the "promise") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the density in high-pressure beats (e.g., the description of the tapestry) slightly risks ornamentation but ultimately serves the accumulative pattern and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist and archivist, destruction and preservation, is a specific, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling concept. The core premise of a "vandalized self-portrait" as a breadcrumb is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail and a bold moral calculus that avoids safety-hedging. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
