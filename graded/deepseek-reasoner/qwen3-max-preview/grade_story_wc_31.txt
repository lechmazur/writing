<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply integrated with the core concept. The lamplighter's motivation ("hunting the color of sound") is specific, poetic, and drives every action. His final micro-choice to leave the ledger is a perfect Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with visible cost and reconfiguring his purpose from searching to signifying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Structure is masterful under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of light, sound, and vows tightens with each beat, culminating in a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The final image of the ledger pulsing "as if in reply" provides undeniable closure and cost. The Orientation Test is waived as the early disorientation ("the color of sound") is the premise itself, paid off perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken library is not merely described; it is the crucible that constrains the protagonist's choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are filtered through his goal-directed perception ("pages blooming like anemones"). The key object (the ledger) is irreplaceable and actively handled, evolving in meaning from a mystery to the answer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake (discovery) is signaled early and deepens through his deliberate wandering and dive. The cost is legible on the page in his gasping surfacing and the conscious renunciation of his quest, leaving the ledger for the next seeker.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of vows, light, and sound, resisting any direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that truth deepens by hiding, and purpose is found in signifying, not just discovering. The final paragraphs reweight all prior material without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("drowned stars reborn," "meteor hush"). The voice's lyrical, measured rhythm is consistent and modulates perfectly with pressure, heightening the climactic revelation. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("cerulean streaked with amber"). A single minor abstraction ("signifying") in the final line is the only hairline slip, but it is earned by the prior concretes and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lamplighter, a sunken library, and luminous vows is wholly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is not a superficial twist but the story's entire logic system, committed to without retreat. The risk-taking in the poetic premise heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
