<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in the character's obsession with "absences." Her motivation ("not fame, nor closure, but unraveling") is clear, intensifies under pressure, and culminates in a final choice (to play the symphony) that is earned by prior causality with visible cost (trembling, lungs empty). The final renunciation of looking back is a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the silence is "no longer hollow but humming," a decisive change in meaning with felt cost. The ghost's peace and her purpose are legible on the page. Causality is tight, with every beat building toward the final, wordless crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is not just a backdrop; it is the primary mechanism of the plot. The setting actively constrains choice (wading, floating podium), supplies the core object (the water-damaged program), and charges the final image ("the opera house exhaled"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-driven action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to angle the lantern and then to "play" is a series of micro-choices that deepen the stakes and narrow her focus, culminating in the final, cost-laden fermata. The cost is unmistakable: she is left "trembling, lungs empty, heart full."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (finding truth in silence, art born from decay) emerges organically from the core concept, setting, and character's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the flood has "composed its masterpiece." The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity and meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects the character's perceptual signature—noticing "unstruck chords" and "in between spaces." The "wordless conversation" is executed with masterful control, using gesture and implication. No head-hopping; voice is singular and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that mirrors the unseen symphony. Figurative language ("music stands leaned like broken reeds") is purposeful and consistent. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. A single minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on the visual sense in early paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story, a musical score, and water damage is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "in between spaces" is fully integrated into the plot, character, and theme. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance without hedging or gimmickry.</comment>
