<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worker's arboreal motivation is concrete and drives every choice. Her patience-based deconstruction method reveals character under pressure. Final choice to follow the dreams feels earned by prior causality with visible cost when she sits to sketch the kept dreams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes the "cartographer of witnessed sorrow," reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The cost is legible in the final image of her sketching beneath the trees.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and forest are vividly rendered and pressure choices. The sextant itself functions as a micro-setting, constraining her action (listening, not forcing) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. The stake (discovering what trees witness) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the sextant's projection of dreams, which deepens her knowledge and forces the final choice to follow. Cost is felt in her renunciation of fixing for remembering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and mapping sorrow emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of her sketching, reweighting the premise of quantified sorrow into something merciful and mapped. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical rhythm is controlled and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. The voice is consistent and effectively modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the quiet, reverent tone of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("hummed with a quiet grief," "exhaling mist like breath held too long"). Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Read-aloud test is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantified sorrow, arboreal memory, and a maintenance worker is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
