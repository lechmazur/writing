<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The operator's motivation is a clear, gnawing hunger to map emotion, rooted in her own erosion from unbounded empathy. Her final choice to walk away unnamed is a powerful Earned Stasis, foreclosing her path with visible cost. The borrowed grief and fractured mathematician's mind are concrete, embodied interiorities that drive specific on-page choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through pattern and image toward a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure. The final glyph reweights the entire premise, and the cost of her unnamed, eroded state is legible. A slight orientation delay in the first paragraph is waived as the disorientation proves functional, teaching the story's patterned, ambiguous method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment are not just vivid but indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The fragment's pulsing light and the workshop's refracting panels are tactile, purpose-driven details integrated into action. The setting is a crucible that shapes the entire narrative's logic and emotional geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulating density of borrowed moods and the halo's dimming light, a coherent pressure under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—mapping the unmappable—tightens meaningfully as the stars vanish, forcing her final, costly act of setting the last type. The cost of her expended empathy is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from image and action, resisting statement for resonant ambiguity. The core concept of transposed empathy is a lived experience, not an abstract thesis, and the ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the mathematics of emotion. The final glyph embodies the story's embrace of complexity and multiple truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a perfect fusion of mathematical precision and lyrical turbulence that reflects the POV's unique perception. The patterned elision and purposeful ambiguity are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the singular perceptual signature is maintained with rhythmic mastery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly dense, but this density is purposeful and pattern-taught, serving the accumulative drive. There is a minor risk of figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whispered equation," "lucid turbulence"), but clarity is never broken and the closure image lands with power. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A breathtakingly original synthesis of mathematical and emotional concepts, feeling both inevitable and unprecedented. The core premise of graphing grief and integrating love is transformed through specific, grounded particulars in character and world. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes and coherence perfectly.</comment>
