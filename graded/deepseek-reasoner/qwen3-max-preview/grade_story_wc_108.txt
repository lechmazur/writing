<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory impulses (phobia-ridden yet adaptive) are embodied under pressure, culminating in a final choice to burn the film that feels earned. However, a minor slip into therapy-speak ("vulnerability could be weaponized") slightly detracts from the raw, embodied interiority of the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with undeniable cost ("walking not as a stunt double... forged in betrayal"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with each decrypted note and the shell's whisper tightening pressure toward the final, decisive act of burning the film.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains movement and charges the final image. While highly evocative, some descriptions ("constellations older than lies") edge toward ornamental, preventing a higher score as they don't always directly constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in decrypting the notes, narrowing options to the single, necessary act of destruction. The cost of this liberation is legible on the page in the final, transformed stance of the character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of betrayal into liberation emerges organically from concrete particulars (the cast, the shell, the fire). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The softest parts hold the sharpest truths") that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a compelling perceptual signature ("moves like fear given legs"). The voice modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, and the lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "forged in betrayal, baptized in trembling certainty" risks synonym churn) prevents a higher score, though clarity is never obscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a phobic stunt double, a whispering shell, and transformative betrayal in a decaying library feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The risk-taking with lyrical density heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
