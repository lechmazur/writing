<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits ("to discover what ceilings hide"), and intensifies to compel higher-stakes choices (prying open the ceiling tile). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with emotions embodied in actions like shallow breathing. The final choice to remove the artifacts is a meaningful change earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost (the responsibility he carries).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist acknowledges the ghost and takes the artifacts, reconfiguring his relationship to the place with a felt cost (the "weightless burden" of responsibility). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through observed details to the final discovery. Causality is tight; his skillfully observant nature directly leads to each discovery. The cost is legible in the final image of him sitting on the counter, bearing witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful (smell of popcorn, drag-marks, dust patterns). The environment subtly guides choice, providing the clues he follows. The setting itself is the antagonist, thick with neglect, and its particulars (the marquee, the water-stained tile) are indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (discovery) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as his observation of dust patterns narrows his options to investigating the ceiling tile. The cost is legible on the page in the "weightless burden" of responsibility he accepts, a price paid for his witnessing. The pressure coheres and grows until the final act reweights the options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and the haunting of neglect emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the building "keeping vigil" and the protagonist as its "witness." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (the extended hand, the sigh in the timber). The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through its particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in the prose's lyrical, observant texture. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and biased in character-specific ways (professional detail filtered through his ghost-seeing lens). Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon, even at peak stress. The voice is singular and consistent, with rhythmic control that supports the atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level syntax accelerates with scene needs. Minor register drift in the phrase "weightless burden" feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in that moment, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, the writing is concise, vivid, and free of loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on ghost stories—ghosts as disturbances in dust, hauntings of neglect. The combination of a repair technician and a horologist's tool feels organic and indispensable. The story commits fully to its premise, following its implications without retreat. The emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, grounded in specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
