<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with somatic markers and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of grief for witness is earned by prior causality. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tone in "somatic markers," but it is immediately grounded in concrete sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the freeze reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to memory. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building to a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable cost felt in the final lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arboretum is an indispensable collaborator, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's specific way of noticing ("how moss climbs stone in spirals"). The environment actively pressures and transforms the character's art.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is a single, profound deepening: the freeze moment. This agency of attention decisively reweights the dominant stake from survival to creation, with cost legible in the shift from "anchor" to "compass" and the act of crying without counting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the coexistence of ruin/regrowth, articulated through the final, resonant image of "the eye within" chaos. The answer to the central question is wholly non-literal and reweights all prior material without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, lyrical signature. POV is stable and deeply embodied. The elision of other characters is purposeful, and the prose's rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, especially in the freeze paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely flawless. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the freeze paragraph ("pearl of stillness," "hollow behind my sternum") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks abstraction before being immediately grounded again.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A singular, risk-taking synthesis of trauma recovery and ecological observation. The core concept of somatic markers grounding a lyrical arc feels fresh and inevitable. The unconventional, quiet structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
