<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal loss, compelling his high-stakes choice at the climax. His final renunciation—mapping lacunae instead of roads—is earned by the causal chain of discovery. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("cyclically spontaneous") but it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds from inciting incident to closure. The Decisive Change (redirecting the strands to conceal the gate) occurs on-page with a clear, felt cost: the burden of guardianship and the need to tame his spontaneous nature. The orientation is immediate and the sister's revelation transforms prior knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Kael's professional POV. The repair bay and the green glass shard are well-anchored. The shard charges the final image, but the setting itself is more a launch point than a constant source of pressure on choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The stakes evolve from personal discovery to a cosmic guardianship, tightening with the sister's warning. The cost is legible in Kael's final, burdened resolve to map blanks, a direct result of the new, heavier truth he must bear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict: the weight of truth and the moral choice between discovery and protection. The final image of mapping "lacunae" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reconfiguring the purpose of his craft without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Kael's synesthetic perception. The voice remains coherent under pressure, and the controlled elision of the journey between worlds is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for a moment of potential figurative density ("like a helix of perfume") in a high-pressure beat, though it is thematically consistent. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and free of loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, multiverse travel, and a personal mystery feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded character choices. The risk-taking in the lyrical, sensory-rich prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
