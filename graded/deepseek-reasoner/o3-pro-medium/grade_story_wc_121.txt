<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ira's motivation is concrete and rooted in a visceral fear ("every corridor she ignored returned as a nightmare wearing her face"). Her micro-choices under pressure, particularly wiping away the droplet showing her as a tyrant, reveal a clear hierarchy of values with a felt cost. The final renunciation of power for love is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing "procedural generation" in her backstory, which feels like diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ira emerges carrying a "darkening brightness," reconfiguring her power with a palpable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through density of imagery and pattern breaks (e.g., the corridor's oscillation of glow). The cost is legible on the page in the image of "countless Iras howled as their corridors collapsed." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The viaduct's arches function as "an algorithm waiting for a value," directly shaping tactics. The "rainlake's surface suspended midair" is the crucial environment for the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each acknowledged memory deepening the stakes and narrowing options. The cost is unmistakable: the guilt of "mass extinction" of other selves. The dominant stake (conquering the internal labyrinth) is signaled early and tightened through a series of consequential choices that force trade-offs, most notably the wiping away of potential futures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of self-construction through honest confrontation of memory emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: a life pattern "impossible to draw yet easy to walk." The final image of the "darkening brightness" avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex synthesis of power and compassion earned through the specific cost of renunciation shown on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a lens of coding and physics ("menu," "algorithm," "editors' room of reality"). The lyrical, compressed diction is consistent and purpose-driven, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. The voice is singular and perfectly suited to the conceptual premise, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs with "darkening brightness," a paradoxical image that is slightly strained and requires extra cognitive load to resolve, though it ultimately serves the theme. This minor artifact in a peak beat prevents a higher score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept fantasy (fractured timelines, procedural generation) with a deeply personal, psychological arc is original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, such as the cost of collapsing possible selves. The risk-taking with structure and voice heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
