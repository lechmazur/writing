<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, culminating in the final ritual. Embodied emotion is strong ("my own pulse drummed softer, as though cushioned by dusk"). A credible endurance is earned, though interior contradiction could be more pronounced in the middle beats to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("even my own pulse drummed softer"). The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building pattern density toward the final, decisive image. The persistent constraint of noise shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is the story's masterstroke. The harmonic caves are not a backdrop but the central antagonist and resource, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-oriented action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from mapping to a ritual of release. The cost is legible in the final, muted repose. A single, meaningful deepening—the shift in strategy—is perfectly sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: calm as a rhythm to be redrawn, not a destination. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept ("bloom of hush") is fully integrated into the plot's logic and resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose is purposefully dense and lyrical, though a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like beaten metal settling") creates minor artifactual drag, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm. Minor deductions for a pattern of simile stacks in early high-pressure beats ("like tidal charts," "like tuning forks") that, while beautiful, create a slight textural artifact and momentary drag on momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, acoustics, and energy beings feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
