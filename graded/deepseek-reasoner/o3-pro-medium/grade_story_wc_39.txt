<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, wistful character. His micro-choices, like selecting the grandmother's hum and releasing the box, reveal his values. However, his internal contradiction under pressure is more told ("lonesome splendor") than shown through embodied, simultaneous impulses, keeping him slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet's purpose is crystallized by the family's visit and his act of sending the music box into the world. The inferred Accumulative lens holds, building through patterns of sound and memory. Cost is legible in the final image of future voices "knocking from inside the glass," promising continued work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The feral loft and glass jars are not just vivid description; they function as the story's crucible, constraining the poet's actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet's unique perception (e.g., "sand freckles," "trembling hush").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the Accumulative lens. The arrival of the family deepens the stakes from personal curation to communal translation. The cost is felt in the poet's realization of his ongoing, solitary role ("lonesome splendor") even as he succeeds in sweetening their sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "gleaned redemption" through sound. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: redemption is a continuous act of translation, not a final state. This is achieved through the specific, earned image of the departing music box, avoiding any moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently wistful. The perceptual signature is strong, with a controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. A minor register drift occurs in the line "Redemption, he knew, was never fully owned," which feels slightly more analytical than the surrounding poetic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single instance of potential overwriting exists in "syllables cracking yet alive," where "yet alive" slightly restates the preceding action, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a sound-collecting poet is highly original and executed with specificity and authenticity. The combination of elements (loft, jars, music box) feels organic and inevitable. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative design, and the final reconfiguration feels earned and fresh.</comment>
