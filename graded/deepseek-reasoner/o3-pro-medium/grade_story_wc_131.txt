<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("pulse fluttered like a moth against dusty glass"). The final choice to reveal themselves is earned by the established motive and the constraint of their methodical nature, with visible cost in the relinquishment of total anonymity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, building through sensory density and pattern to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with undeniable cost in the final image of the dweller holding the "scrap of magnetized night," reconfiguring their relationship to visibility and service. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices (navigating pipe chases) and charging the final image ("sapphire hush inside the aisles"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through the dweller's unique perception, with the library itself functioning as a crucial character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the discovery of the tape fragment deepens the stake, leading directly to the choice to use it to help the child. The cost of becoming visible is legible and felt, altering the protagonist's stated want and foreclosing on total anonymity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as circuitry emerges organically from the fusion of sense memory and physical objects (tape fragment, notes). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The voice is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduct for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like ink inside transparent water"), but it remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the crawl space dweller trope with sense memory and magnetic remembrance is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with high conceptual integrity, creating a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
