<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eren's internal contradiction (unrest vs. duty) is embodied in micro-choices like unloading cargo while detaching. His final surrender is earned by the whale's call acting on his established yearning, with cost felt as memories spilling out. The guarded heart flaw is dramatized, not diagnosed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts (e.g., "the water thickened with kelp ribbons"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eren becomes "water shaped to a man," with cost legible in the spilled memories and the island's conditional nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and scrimshaw are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The whalebone object's evolution from found artifact to heart-unlocking tool is integral. Sensory detail is purposefully selective, reflecting Eren's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift into surrender, driven by Eren's agency. The dominant stake (freedom) tightens as the island appears only through surrender, forcing a trade-off of his old life. The cost is the visible jettisoning of memories and the acceptance of perpetual motion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "combative tenderness" emerges through specific images: corsairs dancing without swords, breakers slamming with "disciplined fury." The final image of Eren's smile—"sharp enough to cut ropes and gentle enough to sew them into nets"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Eren's perceptual signature ("muscles flowing like rope"). The voice is distinct and controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression ("What would it take..."). Elision (the Quietening's origin) is taught and paid off by focusing on its emotional consequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with figurative language serving pattern and payoff ("vegetal applause"). One minor artifact: "marching orders stitched in kindness" slightly mixes metaphor. Rhythm is expertly varied to accelerate and breathe with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-violence world, a magical scrimshaw, and a disappearing island feels organic and fresh. The concept of "combative tenderness" is a non-obvious, specific inflection that heightens stakes. The story fully commits to its premise and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
