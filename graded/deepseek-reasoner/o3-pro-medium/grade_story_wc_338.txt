<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Levin's methodical curiosity and guarded openness are embodied through specific actions like comparing footage and pressing on plaster. His final choice to replace the grate and share the silence feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his shaking muscles and the reconfiguration of his mapping practice. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Levin's understanding of mapping is fundamentally altered. The cost is legible in the final image of "torn parchment and unbroken sky, conjoined at last." All turns arise from established patterns (footage comparison, mentor's note) and character action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot, constraining choices and charging the final image. The fresco vault, henge, and corridor are tactile and purposefully described. Sensory details like "rain-scoured faces" and "cold air that smelled of peat" are selective and reflect Levin's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the discovery of the hidden corridor and cylinder. Levin's agency drives the escalation, and the cost is felt in his physical strain and the reweighting of his purpose. The dominant stake (completing the map/understanding silence) is tightened meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "interpret silence with empathy," culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures, silence, and the reconfiguration of the "whispered chapel" from a place to a practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that modulates under pressure ("Levin felt a prickle"). The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. All elision (e.g., the tape's contents) is purposeful and paid off at closure through Levin's empathetic listening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor overwriting exists in a few phrases (e.g., "cultivating a tone of shielded openness with every hesitant footfall"), creating a slight density bump, but it does not obscure closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, archival mystery, and empathetic listening feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
