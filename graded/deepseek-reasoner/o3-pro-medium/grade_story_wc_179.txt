<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maro's "scheming pacifist" contradiction is embodied in his tactical gentleness, and Tyra's resentment-to-release arc is earned through cellular memory's tactile persuasion. Her final micro-choice—laying her palm on the box—reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The emotional progression from "iron scraping stone" to unknotted resentment feels credible and specific, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of imagery (music box, grace, rivers) until a cadence shift at "Release him" triggers Tyra's decisive internal reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in tears becoming "seeds" and the horizon steadying. The sanctuary's reappearance/vanishment pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (altar use, grace pressing skin) and charges the final image (dissolving with music). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("warm wind," "tremor felt through fingertips"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with dome, altar, and columns guiding action. The music box's broken state is a tactile, irreplaceable object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is accumulative: pressure tightens through layered sensory details (scraping pin, ash-scarred parchment) until the grace "thickens" and forces Tyra's stance crystallization. Agency is her renunciation of resentment, foreclosing a path with cost visible in tears and sparks. The dominant stake (emotional release) is signaled early and tested through the music box's failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the music box's broken melody embodying "songs your bones remember." Subtext operates in Tyra's rolled maps and the grace's wordless persuasion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to resentment through the image of rivers returning to "wash charcoal into fertile silt." No moralizing; complexity resides in the brother's dual role as betrayer and hair-braider.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maro's perceptual signature ("absence of echo could feel like thunder"). Diction is consistently poetic yet character-plausible. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("Release him... so that your map may again include you"). Elision (e.g., how grace works) is taught and paid off in closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm ("knitting itself from motes of stillness"). Minor figurative density in peak beats ("like iron scraping stone" followed by "vibrating inside her marrow" risks slight overlap but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively between long accumulative periods and short declarative beats ("Release him").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "scheming pacifist" premise is fresh and fully committed. The cellular memory method transforms familiar forgiveness themes through biological specificity. Originality synthesizes metaphysical elements (shifting reality, grace) with tactile objects (music box, parchments). The broken pin's irreparable yet functional state is a non-obvious inflection that charges the ending.</comment>
