<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply integrated with the plot; her "persistent curiosity" is not just stated but demonstrated through micro-choices like descending into the dark vault. Her final choice to power the archive is a credible endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost (her lantern's power). The only minor flaw is a slight over-articulation of her role in the line "Incidental heroism... was simply acting," which feels more diagnostic than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot operates on a masterful Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks (static resolving to ticks, then a giggle, then coordinates). Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the atrium floods with sound, reconfiguring the space and its meaning with a clear, felt cost (her lantern's drained power). The lens holds perfectly from the mist-clad opening to the vibrant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the "mist-clad atrium" and "decades-old hearing aid" are not mere backdrop but active constraints that shape every choice. The vault's reveal is the climax, and the final image of the locked door leaving "music for the ghosts and seedlings" is charged by the specific, tactile detail of the mason jars and speakers. Sensory selection is impeccable and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens: each discovery (ticks, giggle, coordinates) deepens the mystery and narrows her options, culminating in the decisive choice to sacrifice her lantern's power. The cost is legible on the page: "bleeding her lantern's power into them." The dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices is tested and fulfilled through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: the cost and necessity of listening. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The boy's call for "remembrance" and the act of preserving the photograph within the jar provide a profound, earned insight into memory and care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional and perceptual signature ("reeling hush," "thundered in her ear"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. A single, very minor artifact exists: the phrase "reeling hush" is repeated from the first line in the final paragraph, which slightly dulls the effect of an otherwise pristine closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("Twilight mist seeped through broken panes and pooled above the fountain where lily pads had turned to paper husks"). The only minor flaw is the aforementioned slight repetition of "reeling hush," a very small loop that does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is brilliantly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of the mundane (hearing aid, photograph) with the fantastical (recording heartbeats in seeds) feels inevitable and deeply ingenious. The story takes bold risks with its quiet, accumulative structure and lands them with masterful coherence.</comment>
