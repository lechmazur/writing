<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Roan's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His transformation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost when he traces his confession. The backstory fragment about the fiancée is anchored in the present and tilts his stance effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost at "tears arrived quietly." The shell's discovery and the pearl's crowning are taught early and pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves constrain choice (shell discovery, pearl alignment) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Roan's professional bias. The environment evolves causally with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening when the shell's confessions flow into Roan. Cost is legible at "tears arrived quietly" and the mission shift. One tightening is sufficient, foreclosing his old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with subtext in the shell's confessions and the pearl's glow. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the "color chorus" weaving emotions. Avoids moralizing; the final image reweights prior material with specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature reflecting Roan's expertise and emotional state. Purposeful compression (e.g., "heartbeat of a hesitation") is taught and pays off. Diction remains within his lexicon, and syntax varies with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent (e.g., "resonant hush" recurs with charged meaning). Sentences advance story and atmosphere without obscuring clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of professional detail with emotional archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight. The shell-and-pearl mechanism is specific and irreplaceable, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Bold risk-taking in lyric mode coheres with closure.</comment>
