<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and character-specific ("heart pounding volcanic tenderness"). The final choice to return the ember is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling fingers and the act of relinquishment. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic labels ("analytically intuitive mind") which is later dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive change (returning the ember) with clear, felt cost ("wept with volcanic tenderness"). The final image reconfigures meaning and options ("libraries rising unburned"). Orientation is immediate; the trail of clues creates tight because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice (the mural clues, the archive's obsidian doors). The environment ("cooled lava tube," "basalt shelves") pressures tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Ash's analytical perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, narrowing options with each clue. The dominant stake (rescuing the promise) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in her emotional state and the final act of return. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and forgiveness emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material ("the archive had never blamed her; it had only waited"). Avoids moralizing; complexity is embraced through the vandalized portrait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and apt; voice is consistent and character-specific ("scorching overdue silence into ash"). Elision (the unknown artist) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor deduction for occasional over-densification of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "heat bloom like memory," "heart pounding volcanic tenderness") which creates slight muddle without obscuring closure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of arsonist and librarian tropes feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
