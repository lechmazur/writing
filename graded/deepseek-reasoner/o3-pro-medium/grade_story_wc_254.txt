<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV character's motivation is clear and intensifies; the poet's "aesthetically driven" trait is shown, not told, through his actions and dialogue. Their micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final compact is earned. A slight deduction for the poet's characterization bordering on archetype, but his choices remain specific and consequential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and held perfectly. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing ("certainty itself might tremble not to break us, but to set rhythm for change") with undeniable on-page cost in the townsfolk's transformed behavior. The linkage from meeting to journey to revelation is seamless and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting is not just vivid but actively constrains and charges the narrative. The frozen lake, cobalt atrium, and quartz colonnade are indispensable, shaping choices and the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and filtered through the POV's awe, achieving a rare integration of environment and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (testing the song of truth) and escalate through the journey to the city. The climax is driven by protagonist agency (pressing the stone) and results in a visible, felt cost—the dissolution of old certainties and the liberation of voices. The pressure coheres and tightens under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of language, truth, and liberation emerges organically from concrete images and events. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting "certainty" through the column's song. Subtext is rich in gesture and image, completely avoiding moralizing or thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The elision and compression are purposeful and taught, paying off at closure. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries distinct idiom for each character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in a few high-density figurative lines (e.g., "shaking snow from roofs and doctrine from memory"), but these do not obscure closure. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or muddle; every sentence advances the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of poetic ban, humming stones, and a "tremor of certainty" feels inevitable and fresh. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic vision.</comment>
