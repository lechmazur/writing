<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Barrow's contradictory impulses—retired yet purpose-driven—act in scene, compelling Orin's journey. His final choice to follow the coordinates is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the wasteland's dangers. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "tinted revelations were not colors of sight but shades of nearness" reweights the premise with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and symbolic objects. The cost is legible in the act of walking into the unknown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement and wasteland environment actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The waxed leaf and phonograph cylinder function as micro-settings that dictate tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cost unmistakable on the page. The journey across the slag dunes represents a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake of connection. The final choice to walk toward the glow is a stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central theme of distance and closeness through the final image of the "portable sunrise." Theme emerges organically from events and images, avoiding direct statement. The conceptual repricing at closure reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off. The voice is consistent and apt, with syntax and rhythm reflecting Orin's worldview. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and serves closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with scene needs without becoming sluggish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative/textural design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of bloodhound, wax leaf, and phonograph codes feels organic and irreplaceable.</comment>
