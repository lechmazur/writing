<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhessa is vividly characterized through her gentle persistence and decisive actions, though the narrator's interiority lacks the contradictory impulses required for the highest band. Her choice to give away the final basket is a powerful micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is established and held, building pressure through layered images and a cadence shift. The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the anonymous donation echoes their own actions, reconfiguring the meaning of their exile with a clear, felt cost of ongoing struggle and hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, perfectly establishing the atmosphere of "amplified quiet." The setting provides crucial context and tone, though it does not actively constrain choices or pressure tactics in a way that would warrant a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening: the encounter with the grandmother. This choice narrows their resources and introduces a tangible cost (being short on coins), charging the final image under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of specific events and images—the bells, the donations, the ridge. The final image of the drawn bell offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how community and hope persist, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly calibrated to the tone of "amplified quiet." The prose possesses a strong perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with purposeful elision (e.g., the unnamed sender) that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic, purposeful phrasing. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats ("hearts clanging like hidden bells") which momentarily slightly obscures clarity, though the closure image remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements with a rare, authentic vision. The concept of resistance through quiet, persistent care feels fresh and inevitable, executed with high conceptual integrity and emotional specificity that avoids cliché.</comment>
