<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's "steadily curious" motivation is embodied through concrete actions and irreverent bargaining with the acid. Her final choice to fire the arrow feels earned by her established character. A slight deduction for the "yearning algorithm" feeling slightly detached from her internal struggle in its conception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) as the bell's silent tone reconfigures the world's possibilities. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through dense imagery toward the final resonant image. A minor deduction for the algorithm's answer feeling like a slight causality shortcut, though its poetic function supports the textural mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid sea and floating workshop are not just vivid backdrop; they actively pressure choices and supply the literal medium (electroplated salt vats) for the bell's creation. The environment is indispensable, constraining every tactic and charging the final image of the calmed sea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled ("to ring a bell no one hears yet") and escalate through the tangible risk of corrosion and the final, irreversible act of firing the arrow. The cost is legible in the calmed sea and answered buoys, a reweighting of the world's logic. Under the accumulative lens, this single decisive intensification is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of irreverent curiosity yielding profound, unseen change emerges entirely through action and image (bargaining with acid, shooting a bell). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The final ticker tape message slightly edges toward statement but is earned by the device's established function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through a lens of "ozone and mischief." POV is stable and deep, with prose rhythm that expertly modulates to match contemplative and peak-pressure beats. The elision of how the algorithm works is taught and paid off by its output.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise with high information density and rhythmic control. It largely avoids scaffolding, though there is a minor risk of overwriting in peaks (e.g., "vectors of longing"). A single instance of slightly mixed metaphor ("nervous teeth") prevents a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are never lost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating workshop, acid sea, and a "yearning algorithm" is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its logical, wondrous conclusion. The choice to have the bell call to things, not people, is a specific, non-obvious, and brilliant inflection.</comment>
