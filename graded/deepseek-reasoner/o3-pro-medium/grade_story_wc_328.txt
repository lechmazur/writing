<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to offer childhood resentments is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The brother's backstory is anchored in the present and alters tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with felt cost ("sorrow had metamorphosed into song"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with a cadence shift reweighting the dominant stake. The persistent constraint of grief shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underground garden pressures choices and supplies resources (arrowhead, phone). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through POV. The flint arrowhead, a micro-setting object, constrains a choice and charges the final image by "dream[ing] of sky."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of metamorphosed sorrow. Pressure coheres and grows until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of transformation ("turning bitterness into a cosmic joke"). Theme emerges from events and images, not direct statement, and resists tidy morals through purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language that is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold. Syntax and rhythm accelerate in step with scene needs without becoming sluggish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cryptid research and emotional transformation. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative/lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
