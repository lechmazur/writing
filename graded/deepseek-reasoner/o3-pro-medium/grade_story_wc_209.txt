<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("Understanding flushed through her like paint through a loaded nozzle"). The final choice to paint the mural is a credible endurance/renunciation earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with visible cost (the mural's ephemerality).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing, landing on-page with undeniable cost ("the mural would fade with the coming dawn"). The persistent constraint of the cathedral's secret and the inherited postcards shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cathedral's hidden window is a micro-setting that constrains the choice (requiring alignment to see the animation) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's artistic bias ("the stone pillars into silhouettes of sleeping giants").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to action. The cost is unmistakable on the page: the realization of her grandfather's failed pursuit and the ephemeral nature of her own grand mural, which forecloses permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question ("flowers bloom at night not for secrecy but for communion") that reweights prior material without a stated moral. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the postcards, the cathedral, and the mural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature. There is a minor, likely unintentional, POV drift in the climax ("Crowds gathered, words evaporating... they listened to color"), which slightly diminishes the single-POV cohesion at a key moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("umbral tenderness"). Zero prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of art, botany, and spirituality feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fresh and fully committed to, with risk-taking (lyricism, quiet climax) that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
