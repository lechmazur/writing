<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final renunciation of personal yearning feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost when "the omission stung." Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with cost when Lira excises her yearning, creating space for future voices. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with the environment actively shaping the narrative's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated with action. The setting evolves with events and subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure increasing through sensory density and discovery. The dominant stake (sculpting identity) tightens meaningfully when Lira confronts the broken sundial, forcing a choice with visible cost. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the tension between preservation and petrification. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's act of writing "only what still breathed." Avoids moralizing; embraces complexity through the cost of omission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with patterned elision that pays off at closure. POV stability maintains a coherent internal texture throughout, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density with clear propulsion, though some figurative language approaches density limits in peak beats ("moonlight pooled inside the fracture like milk in a cracked cup"). No loops or scaffold issues. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory archiving with meteorological magic. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical density pays off without obscuring clarity. Transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
