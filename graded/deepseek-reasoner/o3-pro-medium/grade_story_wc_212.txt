<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alma's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her grandmother's teachings, compelling her high-stakes choice to repair the mirrors. Her "furious tranquility" is a compelling contradiction, though its embodiment could be more active in early beats. The final cost—her aging—is a visible, felt price that earns her endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, achieved through a decisive cadence shift and a visible cost (silver in her hair). The linkage from egg to vortex to chamber is taught and pays off. The final image of a gentler world reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and oak acorn cap are not just vivid but essential, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, woven through action ("boots crunching on hoarfrost"). The setting evolves causally with the ritual, pressuring Alma's mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alma's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to active repair. The dominant stake (borrowed time) tightens meaningfully as the mirrors crack, forcing a trade-off with visible cost. Pressure coheres until the final image reweights the world's options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and specific images (acorn cap, entropy), resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for borrowed time through the final image of a gentler world, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature ("woven of embered feathers"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "knit minutes together") is taught and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, though a potential register drift exists in "muted suns" and "spectral ribbons," slightly clashing with the POV's grounded lexicon. Otherwise, rhythm is masterful, sentences propel the story, and there are no loops or scaffolds. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of seed-saving, entropy, and dragon lore feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the vision is singular and authentic.</comment>
