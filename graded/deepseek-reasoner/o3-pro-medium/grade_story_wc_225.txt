<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhaun's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. His internal conflict is embodied through tactile actions like cataloguing streets and mending threads. The final choice—forgiveness—is earned through on-page causality with visible cost when the woven hush unravels. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost when the village reactivates. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (tapestry, labyrinth) reweighting stakes. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Cost is legible at "the woven hush unraveled, spilling wind, birdsong, and clanging noon bells."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village constrains choices (e.g., frozen clock faces, motionless smoke) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Rhaun's expertise (streets as chess files). The platinum labyrinth actively mirrors his guilt and shapes tactics. Micro-setting (tapestry, needles) is integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Rhaun's agency under the Accumulative lens: decoding the tapestry and reordering the labyrinth. Cost is legible as "secrecy conceded ground to possibility" and the final unravelling. One meaningful tightening (forgiveness) forecloses his path of remorse with visible cost. Stakes are concrete and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (chess gambits, woven silence) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to forgiveness via the prince's ghost lifting a rook. Subtext operates in images (platinum hedges reflecting guilt). Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by chess expertise ("cataloguing streets as if they were chess files"). Diction remains within Rhaun's lexicon. Purposeful compression (e.g., "fierce repose") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("The silence was not empty; it felt braided, taut"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating during climax. Read-aloud ear test passes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess strategy and frozen time feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices (e.g., tapestry as puzzle). Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise commits fully to its implications, avoiding median options.</comment>
