<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's deafness is a consistent, embodied trait that filters perception ("thunderous within her bones") and motivates her quest for tactile music. Her emotional numbness and pursuit of feeling drive every choice, culminating in a micro-choice to "share the silence" that reveals her values. The final beat of carrying her "newly awakened heart as baton" is an earned internal shift with visible cost (tears). Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "impossible possibility," but this does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through sensory density and a cadence shift into resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of Maris walking out, her heart a baton, reconfigures the premise of silence with profound cost felt in the villagers' reactions. The "because/therefore" chain is tight: she seeks feeling, follows the note's instructions, and her actions directly cause the communal awakening. The cost is legible in the line: "Maris felt tears shape themselves along cheeks starved for salt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern is a crucible that constrains and enables choice: its benches of "splintered shells" and the central anvil are resources she uses. The environment evolves causally, becoming an "orchestra" that emits shaped silence. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and POV-filtered ("Dust formed hieroglyphs of former storms"). The setting charges the final image, as the leaves outside now "echoed within her drums."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maris's agency under the accumulative lens: her decision to play the record backward triggers a deepening that changes knowledge (vibrations paint "trembling constellations"). The stake (defeating numbness) is tested when she fears "merely technical success," forcing a higher-stakes choice to listen inwardly to the hush. The cost is the visible emotional unclenching of the villagers and her own tears, proving the stakes were real and paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence as profound communication emerges entirely through image and action, not statement. The core concept—"a filament of hush"—is a concrete particular that evolves in meaning, ultimately fulfilling its "covenant." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: feeling is found not in noise but in "eloquent quiet." The final image of "distant thunder applauding in restraint" perfectly crystallizes the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("audibly muted to others, thunderous within her bones"). The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating under pressure ("Each backward note bled warmth into stone walls"). The lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences accelerate and breathe with scene needs ("The drum maker had promised one, forged around a filament of hush"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "impossible possibility," which feels slightly abstract against the concrete texture. However, no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf protagonist, a filament of silence, and backward-recorded songs is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed without retreat. The risk-taking—a nearly silent climax—heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance. The story transforms its fantastical elements into a specific, emotionally authentic journey.</comment>
