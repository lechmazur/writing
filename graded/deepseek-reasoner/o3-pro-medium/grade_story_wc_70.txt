<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices revealing values. Bram's involuntary truth-telling trait is embodied and constrains interactions credibly. The final choice to speak the answer is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (reactivating drones) with felt cost (ritual requirement). Orientation is immediate; the architect's puzzle mechanism pays off cleanly at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposefully integrated—the tower constrains movement, the lacquer box charges the climax. "Nectar dusk" motif recurs meaningfully. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (city-wide blackout) escalate through protagonist's agency under causal lens. The riddle narrows options, and the spoken answer carries cost. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (wonder in routine) emerges organically through imagery and action, not statement. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("air tasted of copper"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Compression is purposeful and legible, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lightning collection, truthful keeper, and drone beehive feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
