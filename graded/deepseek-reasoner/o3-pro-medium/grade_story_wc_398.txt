<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The protagonist's shift from seeking work to accepting apprenticeship feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the final image of internalized glow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost at "honeyed glow now inside me." Orientation is slightly delayed but functional for the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the amber pavilion and burned letter edge actively shape the conversation and apprenticeship offer. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias with exquisite texture ("dew freckles the vines").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the final acceptance. The dominant stake (finding purpose through translation) tightens through the sentinel's metaphorical challenges, though pressure could be slightly more visceral earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (burned letter, pruned cane) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of translation and loss, though the "mismatches" concept is occasionally explicit in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice remains consistent and apt for the lyrical mode, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("amber pavilion," "jarred honey"). Syntax accelerates and breathes with scene needs, particularly in the closure paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of translation and viticulture metaphors feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity avoids generic templates through grounded particulars.</comment>
