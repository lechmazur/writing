<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of rewriting for listening is earned by prior causality. The "confidently uncertain" trait is stated but could be more embodied in the peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing with cost: "I felt no triumph, only a gently weighted peace." The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through density increases and a decisive cadence shift. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly and basalt moon are vividly rendered and actively constrain choice, supplying the ink and shaping the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the anomaly's surge providing coherent pressure that forces a stance crystallization. The cost of prior failure and the ethical weight of editing are legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of editing history, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the shift from rewriting to accompanying events. The ethic of commas is explored with meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor mixed metaphor ("corkscrewed like distracted bees") and a slight register elevation in peak beats prevent a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of editing spacetime with a pen offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination feels organic and fully committed, with specific grounded choices in character and world that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
