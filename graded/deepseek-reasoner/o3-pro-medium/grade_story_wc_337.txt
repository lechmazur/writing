<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neris's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal values. The final choice to bow and offer applause is earned by prior causality, though a slight diagnostic note in explaining the actor's backstory prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (the spirit descending, silence becoming gentle). The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly through pattern breaks and cadence shifts. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, tapestry needle, and fisherman's net actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, with the environment evolving consistently under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Neris's agency in unraveling knots, which narrows options and reweights the stake with visible cost (silence cracking, spirit snarling). The dominant stake (grounding the spirit) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (silence, net, mask) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of restoration and recognition, reweighting prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure without muddling clarity in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of restoration ritual, spirit work, and oceanic mythology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
