<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maia's characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion and a micro-choice hierarchy that culminates in her decisive act at the lagoon. Her internal contradiction—firefighter versus arsonist's daughter—is dramatized, not summarized, and her final renunciation ("I will douse what you lit, but I will not despise the spark that made me") is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds perfectly, building to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the lagoon. The closure lands with undeniable cost as Maia's scar tingles and woodsmoke lifts from her skin. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of black sand and fire/water imagery is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and migrating clouds are not decorative; they actively pressure Maia's decision and become the instrument for her closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through her professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift at the lagoon, reweighting the dominant stake of inherited pain. Maia's agency in whispering her vow and sinking the coin forces a trade-off with a visible price, altering her tactical stance toward future fires.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming inheritance through "unyielding compassion" emerges entirely from concrete action and image, culminating in the non-literal, resonant answer of the lagoon's song. It avoids moralizing; the final image reweights prior material without stating a thesis, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a firefighter's lens ("kelp-drift peace," "cinder road"). The lyrical compression is purposefully taught and paid off at closure. The single line of dialogue from the pilgrim is natural and carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor overwriting risk exists in "lunar time," a slightly precious metaphor, but it does not harm closure clarity. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts; every sentence advances the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a firefighter collecting black sand evidence and an arsonist's daughter seeking healing at a mystical lagoon is profoundly original and feels inevitable. The risk-taking with a lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, transforming its elements into a singular vision.</comment>
