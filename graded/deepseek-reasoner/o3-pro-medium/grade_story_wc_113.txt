<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's obsession is concrete and embodied, compelling her high-stakes choice to disrupt the stage. Her musician identity informs her perception and actions. A slight lack of interior contradiction in the peak beat prevents a higher score, but her motivation is clear and intensifies credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through an accumulative/textural lens, with the mosaic pattern completing the spectral score. The cost is legible in the final, rich silence and the fulfilled, now-blank program. Causality is tight, with her playing directly summoning the revelation and prompting the decisive physical action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is an indispensable, pressure-applying environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the water, lantern light, and decaying architecture actively shaping Mira's quest and the story's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to playing to the physically disruptive act of opening the trapdoor. The cost is felt in the hall's sighing settlement and the irreversible change to the space, narrowing her options and unveiling the final truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit of music in silence and ruin, culminating in the maestro's credo: "Music ends, yet echoes house the living." This offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of art's persistence, reweighting the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's musician's perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "ripples set the walls shimmering with reflected notes"). The prose's lyrical, rhythmically controlled quality is voice-motivated and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with strong rhythm and sentence-level propulsion. A minor tendency toward similar sentence lengths in the opening paragraphs creates a slight rhythmic uniformity, preventing a perfect score, but there are no artifacts harming clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a musician deciphering a ghost's score through water damage in a flooded opera house—is a fresh, specific, and brilliantly executed synthesis. The concept is fully committed to and follows its implications with high originality and authenticity of vision, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
