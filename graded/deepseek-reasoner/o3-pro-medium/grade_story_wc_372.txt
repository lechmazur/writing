<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quillan's meticulous nature is consistently embodied through actions like measuring distances and sampling frequencies, driving his choice to test the slide. His internal conflict between order and unresolved grief is dramatized in the projection's revelation, and his final micro-choice to measure the light waveform earns his emotional reconfiguration with visible cost ("the cold weight inside his chest soften").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density and the slide's summons until the projection forces a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page as Quillan measures and inscribes the vow, with cost legible in the "thundered" guilt and the softened but archived weight in his chest. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen library is not merely decorative; it constrains choice through its glacial doors and rime-veiled codices, and charges the final image with the "snow sifted from the rafters." Sensory details like "exhaling a plume that glittered like ground diamonds" are purposefully filtered through Quillan's professional bias for measurement and preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Quillan's agency under the Accumulative lens: his decision to test the slide narrows options and leads to the projection's revelation, which deepens the stakes from cataloging to personal redemption. The cost is felt in his realization of omitted vows and the thunder of guilt, though the final cadence shift to resolution is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between measured order and unspoken emotional truths, resolved by Quillan's act of measuring the light—a non-literal answer that binds past to page. The final image of the vow glowing in the ledger offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing, reweighting his meticulous nature as both flaw and redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Quillan's profession ("sampling frequencies of silence"). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, from the "quartz hush" opening to the urgent, measured cadence of the projection scene. Purposeful compression (e.g., Lyra's backstory) is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring causality, with high information density ("scattering prismatic hieroglyphs across the archives"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and voice-motivated (e.g., "gears chirping like distant sparrows frozen midflight"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion accelerates through the projection beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a frozen library, a magic lantern slide, and a meticulously measured emotional reckoning feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off with coherence, and the core premise is transformed through specific lived detail (e.g., the tuning fork runes) and a non-obvious moral calculus about preservation versus expression.</comment>
