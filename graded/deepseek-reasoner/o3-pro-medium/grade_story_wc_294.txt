<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eliot's perceptively calm gaze and Mira's exhausted curiosity are embodied through micro-choices and specific interaction with the foreign money. Their final choice to "walk listening" is earned by the prior causality of discovering the memorial loop. A slight deduction for Mira's voice distinction being less sharp than Eliot's internal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The pattern of territorial markers and looping paths tightens into the discovery of the memorial road, reconfiguring their understanding with clear cost: "neither triumph nor sorrow, merely the weight of being oriented at last."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The circus train is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are filtered through POV and purposefully integrated into action, such as the wind rattling trapeze chains and the dust on mahogany panels. The environment is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the pattern-breaking discovery of the union's memorial road. The cost is legible: their startup's collapse is re-framed as a "warning etched in asphalt," forcing a stance crystallization that alters their tactics from optimizing to listening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the foreign money, the startup's algorithms, and the memorial road, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "Paths circle back because something vital stands guard." The final image of them "inhabiting the curve" offers a profound reweighting without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the startup's history summarized efficiently). A minor deduction for occasional overly lush phrasing ("spent lions," "filmstrip of years") that slightly disrupts the voice's calibrated calm in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("filmstrip of years," "dissuaded from storming") causes slight register drift, preventing a higher score. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of highway robbery, startup culture, and territorial ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of blending these elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the specific lived detail (e.g., Tanzanian shilingi) anchors the universals.</comment>
