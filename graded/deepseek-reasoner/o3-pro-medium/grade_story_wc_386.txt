<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is vivid and specific, with her professional expertise ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer") grounding her actions. Her internal contradiction—confidence in her work versus the vulnerability of navigating others' dreams—is shown through embodied micro-choices, such as placing the snow globe and speaking her truth to the monks. Her final choice to expose the glacier's secret is a high-stakes action motivated by her established trait of weaving truth from lies, and the cost of the monks' potential rejection is felt. A minor deduction for the monks' reactions being slightly uniform, but their collective recoil and tremor still apply sufficient pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Causal, with strong because/therefore linkages: the monks' request leads to Mara's investigation, which reveals the keeper's plight, compelling her confrontation. Closure is a decisive change (DC) as the keeper is released, with cost legible in the monks' initial fear and the glacier's physical transformation ("cry and glitter"). Orientation is clear by line 5, and the plot amnesia guardrail holds—no forgotten abilities or retroactive patches. The persistent constraint of the monks' denial shapes Mara's tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image, with the ice pedestal and candlelight refracting to enable Mara's ritual. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("fragrant with resinous smoke," "petals frozen mid-fall"), filtered through Mara's professional bias. The environment evolves causally with the climax, becoming translucent to reveal memory corridors. Spatial choreography is coherent, from the surface dive to the shrine's interior.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens: her dream analysis tightens options by identifying the keeper, leading to her decisive exposure of the truth. The dominant stake (salvaging truth from denial) is signaled early and deepens through her investigation. Cost is unmistakable in the monks' recoil and the glacier's tremor, altering tactics as they reluctantly carry the globe outside. No coincidental resolution; the keeper's release is earned by Mara's confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images—truth versus polished legends—without moralizing. The snow globe and "windows of connection" serve as recurring motifs that charge the closure, reweighting meaning from loneliness to release. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the keeper's departure and the glacier's transformation. Subtext operates in implication, such as the monks' fear of desecration reflecting their attachment to flawlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mara's perceptual signature ("breath shimmering like borrowed starlight"). Diction remains within her lexicon, with rhythmic control under pressure ("stitching the shards she found"). Purposeful compression (e.g., the dream sequences) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is distinct and consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates with scene needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("theatre of borrowed stars," "glacier cry and glitter"). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with sentence openings varying naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost whispering, dream analysis, and glacial setting feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices, such as the melted snow globe as a vessel for memory. Risk-taking in the lyric-dream sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on haunting, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
