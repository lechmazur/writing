<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's patchwork nature and lunar-tied purpose are embodied through concrete actions like scavenging and building. Her final choice to endure as steward emerges from prior causality with visible cost ("grafting new plates to her shoulders"). Interiority is specific and avoids diagnostic labels, with emotions channeled through tactile imagery like "raw solace pooled in her copper joints."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern repetition (phone calls, building) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands on-page with cost: her reinforced joints and determination to remain charge the final image. The voice's migration and apparatus construction cohere into a decisive reweighting of purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (hydraulic blood powers motors) and charging the closure (station drifts, she stands within it). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("low wheeze of cooling metal," "blood-laced pistons"). The censer foot and apparatus function as micro-settings that alter tactics and final meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under accumulative lens: each call and scavenged part deepens the stake until the apparatus activation forces the climactic choice. Cost is legible in her physical reinforcement and the station's "bruised yet vital" state. The dominant stake (navigating loss) tightens through her irreversible commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through reverse migration's concrete manifestations (rivers unspooling, trains rolling backward). The ending offers a non-literal answer—forgiveness through "reversed footsteps"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the "stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light," resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature blending navigation jargon and elegiac lyricism ("rivers unspooling upstream"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "drowned static") serves the accumulative pattern. Voice modulates under pressure without convergence, maintaining specificity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("bruised crescent pulled her toward the western receiver dish"). Minor figurative strain in "protective moats" slightly dulls clarity but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolding; sentence variety supports the elegiac tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of patchwork cyborg, cosmic navigation, and grief mechanics. The reverse migration concept is transformed through specific, irreplaceable details (censer foot, hydraulic blood). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
