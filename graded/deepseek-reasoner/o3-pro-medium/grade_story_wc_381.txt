<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in protecting the world from danger, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through embodied actions like folding the vowel into paper. A meaningful change from burdened to quiet cartographer is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the prophecy is turned inward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the prophecy is turned inward with visible cost ("meaning could heal before ever being uttered again"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks and cadence shifts. The final image reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost, and a persistent constraint (the prophecy's danger) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brook and origami wing function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the summoner's perception. The nocturnal haven and quiet brook pressure choices, supplying the water as a resource for the ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the stone footpath and brook's bend guiding action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through density increases and pattern breaks. The dominant stake (hushing the prophecy) is signaled early and tightens through the summoner's actions. Cost is legible when the last syllable is extracted and folded away, with the meadow brightening as terrors are erased.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of silencing danger through transformation rather than destruction. Theme emerges through events and images, particularly the origami wings and water flow, without direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, such as the library metaphor for fulfilled silence. The final image reweights prior material with profound ambiguity and healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, with syntax and rhythm reflecting the summoner's focused state. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift, even at emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though "terrestrially cosmic shimmer" risks slight overreach. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally without algorithmic patterns. Minor hairline slips in metaphor coherence prevent a higher score, but closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, silence mapping, and prophetic danger feels fresh and non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, with a singular artistic stance.</comment>
