<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("trembling like heat in a clenched fist"), with a credible emotional progression from guarded tension to cathartic release. The final choice to unspool the memory is earned by the guardian's silent empathy and the apparatus's demand, foreclosing the path of silence with the visible cost of tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through sensory density and symbolic weight toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with undeniable cost ("Warm tears cooled instantly") and a reconfiguration of grief into possibility, charged by the final image of the lantern boat-like sadness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in economy and purpose. The cobalt dock, boathouse, and shutters are not merely described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The canal itself functions as a character, its "stillwater tension" and reflective properties essential to the plot's mechanics and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to participation. The dominant stake—the cost of relinquishing a secret—is tightened by the guardian's silent invitation and the mechanical demand of the apparatus, culminating in a felt price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image and action, achieving a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of grief. The final lines ("a half-spoken secret found its sky") resist moralizing, offering a resonant conceptual repricing of pain as a map through the specific, earned particulars of the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a poetic, perceptive voice. The prose's distinct texture—lyrical yet precise—modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The elision of the guardian's spoken voice is a taught, purposeful pattern that pays off brilliantly in the "hush between shutter beats."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "creating patterns with shutters" is repeated verbatim from the guardian's gesture to the protagonist's realization, creating a slight echo. However, this does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent guardian, a dental mirror, and a shutter-and-light apparatus to manifest constellations from grief is strikingly original and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept feels wholly organic, and the bold risk of a voiceless resolution pays off, heightening stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
