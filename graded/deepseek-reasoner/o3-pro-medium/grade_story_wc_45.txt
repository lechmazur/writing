<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora's core contradiction ("forgiving skeptic") is embodied in micro-choices, compelling her final vow. Kedron's "shrewdly innocent" trait is less active, feeling more told than shown in his on-page decisions, though his bone-setting lineage informs his goal. The final choice to pursue the heart is motivated by Liora's established desire for answers, though Kedron's shift is less dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("earned wonder"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, escalating through pattern density (constellations, heart jar). A minor causality break occurs when the fountain reveals a door without clear precedent, a convenience slightly weakening the otherwise earned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden is a masterful micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scent of milk and iron," "stairs ribbed like vertebrae"). The bone-star trellises are a unique, irreplaceable element that directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding the truth/real child) are clear. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is strong, driven by protagonist agency (testing the tooth, vowing to track yearning, retrieving the heart). The cost is legible in the final, quiet reconfiguration of the garden and the distant cradle's creak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truth, forgiveness, correction) emerges organically from the constellation imagery and Liora's internal conflict. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "mistakes charted now as permanent starlight," avoiding moralizing. The integration is specific and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature ("nostalgia mixed with fresh astonishment"). Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "secret biology of betrayal," which feels slightly elevated for the POV. Dialogue is minimal but functional and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic and largely effective, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting ("tonal signature of nostalgic innovation"). A minor paraphrase loop exists between "cleft in certainty" and "wound beneath her ribs." Rhythm and syntax are otherwise well-controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone-setting, changeling lore, and mechanical constellations is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking with imagery pays off, heightening stakes and coherence.</comment>
