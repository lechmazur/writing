<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear, consistent, and compels higher-stakes choices, culminating in her vow to guard the corridors. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through embodied perception (e.g., "ears were more compass than ornament"). The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost—forsaking comfort for legacy. A minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic labeling in "sensitively perceptive," though it is largely dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the architecture becomes a "living organ," reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost felt in Liora's vow. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern breaks. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. Cost is legible in the final image: "the sheer weight of legacy's burden settling on her shoulders."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The ivy-veiled passage and crystalline recorder are tactile and purposeful, integrated into action (e.g., "ivy thinned to reveal an old maintenance hatch"). Sensory detail is selective and reflects Liora's expertise, with the environment actively shaping her discoveries and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through discoveries (diaries, negative, hatch). Cost is unmistakable in her renunciation of comfort for guardianship. The dominant stake (preserving echoes) is signaled early and deepens through each find, foreclosing the option of abandonment with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy and memory, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The final image of "walls awake" synthesizes the thematic core through concrete particulars, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature voice that modulates under pressure. Compression and elision are purposeful and taught early (e.g., "echoes pooled where green tendrils cooled the hot air"). No head-hopping or register drift. The voice consistently filters setting and action through Liora's specialized consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "humming like a throat cleared for confession"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "Legacy's burden pulsed," but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of echo cartography is fresh and non-obvious, transformed through specific world logic and moral calculus. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise, avoiding template plots or derivative elements through grounded, idiosyncratic detail.</comment>
