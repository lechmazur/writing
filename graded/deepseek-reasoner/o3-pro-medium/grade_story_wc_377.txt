<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arlen's seasonal muteness is a compelling, embodied constraint that motivates his kinetic listening and actions. His micro-choices under pressure, like replacing the hinge with muffled tools, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final etching of silent instructions is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible, conceptual cost. A hairline deduction for internal contradiction being more implied than dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the etched instructions crystallize future options with undeniable cost. Orientation is masterful, anchoring who, where, and when within the first sentence. The council's visit and the cracked hinge provide two distinct pressure points that deepen the dominant stake, culminating in the decisive, cost-heavy final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff and the iceberg fragment are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The environment is fully integrated into action and perception, with sensory details like "clouds that curled like parchment" reflecting the POV's unique worldview. The iceberg fragment's evolving warmth is a superb micro-setting detail that directly triggers the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the council's pressure and the hinge's failure force Arlen's reparative and preparatory actions. The cost is legible on the page in the "hidden fracture" and the resolve to etch instructions, reweighting the stake of preserving wonder. A single, meaningful tightening from external doubt to internal flaw is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of sound, silence, and preservation, resisting moralizing. The final image of the "kinetic map" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of perpetuating truth beyond language. The etching of instructions conceptually reprises the opening's "words become unnecessary," charging the closure with profound thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("listened with the whole cage of his ribs"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught from the start and pays off at closure. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Arlen's professional, sensory-specific worldview. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though a minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("torches that sputtered like doubtful bees" slightly strains the established physical logic). Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, modulating perfectly with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concepts (sound, silence, ice, kinetics) feels inevitable and indispensable. The specific, lived-in details of the bell tuner's craft and the trading kites anchor the fantastical premise in a grounded, singular vision. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure fully succeeds in heightening stakes and coherence.</comment>
