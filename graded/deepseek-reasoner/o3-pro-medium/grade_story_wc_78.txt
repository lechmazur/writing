<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is clear, embodied, and drives every on-page action. Her micro-choices under pressure, like mapping the chain's resonance and pitching sparks into the gale, reveal a hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward poetic abstraction in interiority, but her final stance of endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held, with pressure escalating through a density increase in the storm. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her purpose and the orchard's state with undeniable cost ("newly salted by rain"). The linkage from cloud reading to storm modulation is coherent and the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The driftwood circle and storm are tactile pressures, and the xylophone mallet is a micro-setting tool that evolves in use. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, reflecting Mira's professional priorities as a prophet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the storm providing coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the "newly salted" blossoms and flexed driftwood. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient at this length, though the storm's arrival is slightly abrupt, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transforming obstacles into music emerges organically from concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the humming mallet and gathering cirrus. It embraces complexity without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic modulation. The voice is highly distinctive, though the density of figurative language creates minor moments of opacity that slightly slow momentum. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly inventive, with excellent rhythmic control. However, the density of figurative language ("like ink in tidal watercolor") occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats, creating minor clarity issues. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and there are no loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of music, magic, and seafaring. The combination feels organic and singular, committed fully to its own logic. The specific, verifiable detail (e.g., "seven-eight time") creates authenticity. Risk-taking in the lyrical style heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
