<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her terminal diagnosis, compelling high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through actions like climbing trees and soldering junctions. Her "gently systematic" trait is embodied in micro-choices, and her final renunciation feels earned with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary; contradictions act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pattern density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with villagers witnessing the orchard's secrets, cost legible in Mara's exhaustion and impending death. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; causality is tight with no breaks. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., basalt causeway, living pillars) and charging the final image with luminous runes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "salt-sweet fugue," "luminous veins"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the experiment. The temple orchard functions as a micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fostering interspecies respect) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases (copper network, dolphin clicks). Mara's agency drives each tightening, with cost visible in her dwindling time and physical effort. The final listening reweights stakes with a felt price—communal recognition of ecological intimacy. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (copper wiring, root diagrams) without direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer to interspecies connection via "branching math," reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in implication (priest's pulse echo, children's verses). No moralizing; complexity embraces ambiguity with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("handwriting disciplined yet looping like tide lines"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon; syntax varies rhythmically with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("Sea wind hummed along the wire"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; metaphors are consistent and voice-motivated. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud test passes with varied openings and paragraph lengths; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological communication and terminal illness feels inevitable. Core premise is fresh and fully committed, with risk-taking in lyric structure heightening stakes. Details are particular (oak branches from wrecks, nautilus spirals). Tropes are transformed through grounded choices; no derivative echoes or safety hedging.</comment>
