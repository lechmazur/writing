<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orlan's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his pragmatic wisdom and internal conflict over his father's legacy driving every choice. His micro-choices, like stroking the brittle petal and commemorating small victories, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of mended deception for transparency is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the reconfiguration of his identity and the garden's response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds firmly: Orlan's action (polishing) directly causes the garden's reaction (shifting, opening a path), leading to the decisive change (sundial registering 'Gardener'). Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with undeniable cost felt in the image of "blooming withering" and the reweighting of his inherited flaws into "promises awaiting polish."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden maze is not merely a setting but an active, constraining character that pressures choices and supplies the pivotal resource (the root) for the climax. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through Orlan's professional POV ("counts of last night's dew"). The final image of "blooming withering" is charged by the environment, making the setting indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Orlan's agency under the causal lens: his deliberate act of polishing the marble triggers the garden's response, which forces the final, higher-stakes choice of pressing the marble to the root. The cost is legible on the page in the "tremor" and the "fragrant dust that smelled of both birth and compost," reweighting the dominant stake of proving his worth versus his father's legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and is resolved through the potent, non-literal final image of "blooming withering," which answers the question of mended deception versus faithful caretaking. The concept of "faith" is repriced against measurable "luck" without a hint of moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, complex ambiguity that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, consistent perceptual signature, with a lyrical yet precise rhythm that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity ("weaving through hedges like breath from something sleeping and old"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Orlan's worldview. There is no head-hopping, and the purposeful elision of other characters focuses the narrative power.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistently sharp and purposeful ("reducing planets to axioms"). Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally, accelerating with the garden's shift and breathing into the resonant closure. The final line is a masterclass in textural specificity and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a measurable luck economy with a sentient garden and a thematic conflict over inheritance feels wholly original and inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk of a quiet, ecological climax pays off with profound stakes and coherence.</comment>
