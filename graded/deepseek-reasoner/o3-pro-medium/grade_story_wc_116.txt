<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices under pressure (e.g., the decision to refold the swan into a boat). The final choice to witness rather than intervene is an Earned Stasis rooted in the established oath, with visible cost as the water rises. The trait "grips reality loosely" is more stated than dramatized in key beats, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist chooses to witness from the boat, reconfiguring the stakes of the oath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through environmental density and the rising river. Cost is legible on the page: "Floodwater had risen... letting sorrow pour downward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choice; the obsidian refuge constrains the protagonist's action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV. The initial library setting is strong but does not recur to constrain later tactics, a minor limitation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the rising river applying coherent pressure that forces the final stance crystallization. The cost is unmistakable: the protagonist must choose between oath and conscience as the water gnaws the bank. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient and expertly executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing versus intervening emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of the boat drifting onward embodies the thematic tension without moralizing. The recurring motif of silence is transformed and reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the journey's duration) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistently sharp and coherent. A minor syntactic monotony appears in one beat ("I unfolded, refolded, and the corridors unfolded with me"), but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chronicler, origami magic, and an obsidian refuge feels fresh and organic. The core concept of regenerative silence is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
