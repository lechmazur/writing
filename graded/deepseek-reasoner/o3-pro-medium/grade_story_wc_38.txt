<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptionally embodied through dance and micro-choices under pressure. Her calm defiance is consistent, and the final interaction with Dr. Vane reveals her hierarchy of values. The choice to grant him a die is a credible, flawed act of moral ambiguity that complicates her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where stolen data and a reconfigured laboratory firmware create a new world state. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through lyrical density and pattern breaks. Cost is legible in the laboratory's implosion and the "salt and triumph" burning her lungs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is indispensable, actively constraining choices through water pressure, barnacle-covered sensors, and corrosive decay. It charges the final image of a "drowning cathedral." Luminous plankton painting "ghost-green constellations" is a breathtaking, purposeful sensory detail that guides her escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a masterful cadence shift from methodical dance to structural collapse. Agency is clear: Lira's sabotage in the coolant tunnels and her dance to reprogram defenses directly cause the climax. The cost is the physical destruction of the lab and the moral price of her encounter with Vane.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of encrypted vulnerability as strength is fully integrated, emerging from Lira's actions and the story's core mechanics. The final image of the broadcast "weaving public outcry" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The allegory left in the firmware is a brilliant, earned thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is extraordinarily distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, percussive rhythm that mirrors the dance ("knees struck invisible drums"). The POV is perfectly stable, and the elision of standard hacking for a "dance-language" is a taught pattern paid off at closure. Every sentence is filtered through Lira's precise, metaphorical perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of figurative stacking in "sea anemones offering their fragile data-petals" following other metaphors, but it does not obscure clarity. The final paragraph's syntax masterfully accelerates and then slows to a resonant conclusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a code-breaker who works through dance in a sunken lab is brilliantly original and feels inevitable. The spider-web metaphor is transformed from a cliché into a structural and thematic engine. The risk of a non-violent, lyrical resolution to high-stakes conflict is executed with flawless coherence.</comment>
