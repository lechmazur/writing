<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, with her blindness not as limitation but as specialized perception. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle in the repair process. The final insight about faith in patterns feels earned through her actions and teachings to Rowan. Interiority is concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong as pressure builds through the three-basin examination sequence. Closure lands with Charged Poise as the hummingbird traces the tracks "like blessing steel," reconfiguring the depot's harmony. Cost is legible in the time pressure of the lifting anchor. Minor deduction for slight convenience in the three-basin method appearing exactly when needed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated and constrains choice throughout. The water basins function as micro-settings that directly enable Mara's unique perception method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with mist, steam, and water ripples creating a cohesive atmosphere. The depot environment pressures the repair through the looming departure timetable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled through the ship's maiden voyage and rail schedule harmony. Pressure escalates meaningfully through the three repair stages and the audible anchor lifting. The time constraint alters tactics, forcing efficiency. Minor deduction as the external pressure remains somewhat static after establishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the repair process and Mara's final insight about "decoding feedback we already carry." The water refraction method becomes a metaphor for perception beyond sight. Subtext operates beautifully in the silent communication between Mara and Rowan. The ending offers resonant non-literal wisdom without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable and distinct with Rowan's observational voice. Prose has exceptional rhythmic control, particularly in descriptions of sensory perception. The elision of how Mara "listens" to light refraction is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences like "sunlight glancing from mended wings" do multiple jobs of advancing action, image, and theme. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful throughout. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during repair sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk elements with sensory perception creates a fresh, non-obvious angle. Mara's blindness-as-specialization transforms the disability trope through specific world logic. The water refraction examination method is particularly ingenious. Risk-taking in the sensory description heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
