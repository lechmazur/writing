<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, rooted in grief and professional duty, and intensifies under the pressure of her vigil. Her internal conflict—between solitude and connection—is embodied in her micro-choice to broadcast the translation, a choice earned by prior causality. The final endurance is credible, with a visible cost in her tears and steadied breath. The only minor limitation is a slight tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness in the climax ("he understood then..."), though it remains largely dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered imagery and knowledge until the final resonant reconfiguration of solitude into community. Closure is achieved through a conceptual repricing of "shared burdens," with cost legible in Mira's tears and the collective response. The orientation is immediate and clear. A minor deduction for the climax's slightly summarized realization ("She understood then..."), which slightly softens the on-page cost of the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting is integral, constraining choice through the telescope and sidereal clock. The daylily-pressed telegram is a masterful micro-setting object that charges the final image and actively shapes Mira's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional and emotional priorities, woven seamlessly into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the alignment of star pulses and glyphs, which narrows options and forces the costly choice to broadcast. The dominant stake (preventing weaponized knowledge) is signaled early and paid off. The cost is visible in Mira's emotional reaction and her altered resolve to map aspirations next.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of shared burdens, integrated through specific events like the broadcast and the firefly-like replies. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final thought about "weight, not direction" introduces purposeful ambiguity that deepens rather than confuses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's lyrical density is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, paying off at closure. There is no head-hopping or register drift. The elision of technical process is purposeful and legible, serving the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery. A minor risk of overwriting in the climax ("confessional, auditorium, and infirmary") is mitigated because the pattern is taught and the effect supports pressure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy, archaeology, and grief feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. The final image of burdens grown "feather-soft" is a bold, specific inflection.</comment>
