<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply embodied through tactile details (compass rose, graphite smearing) and micro-choices (killing the lamp, sketching). The final stance crystallization—turning confusion into exploration—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the smeared comet tail and abandoned sketch. The "blessed pariah" status is slightly less integrated into the choice mechanics, but interior contradiction is vivid and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through sensory density (silence, starlight, ticking bulkhead) and a cadence shift at the shield retraction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist's internal reorientation—choosing to walk into exploration—is crystallized by the final image of the folded paper ship and the universe waiting. Cost is legible in the smeared sketch and the relinquished ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observation deck is a masterclass in micro-setting: it constrains choice (limited light, retracting shields) and charges the final image (starlight bathing the compass, the paper ship at the viewport). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's urgency and memory. The deck's echoed silence and latent sensor throbs are integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: killing the lamp, sketching, and orienting the compass intensify the stake (turning confusion into exploration). The shield retraction acts as a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Cost is unmistakable in the smeared comet tail and the relinquishment of the sketch, foreclosing the path of frozen grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of ritual and exploration, memory and starlight. The final image of the paper ship and the walk toward true north offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to navigate loss. The compass rose and sketching custom are particulars that resist abstraction, and the ending embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical precision ("temporally stretched") and poetic lyricism ("molten sugar pulled into clear threads"). The single line of dialogue from the intercom is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Minor rhythmic monotony in a few mid-paragraph sentences prevents a higher score, but elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language is consistent and legible, serving character and atmosphere ("darkness poured over the deck like cold water"). One minor loop exists in the repeated "echoed silence," but it is pattern-taught and charged, thus not penalized. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi (time dilation) with intimate emotional ritual (sketching anniversaries) is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The concept of "true north" as a direction rather than a location is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the voice is singular and authentic.</comment>
