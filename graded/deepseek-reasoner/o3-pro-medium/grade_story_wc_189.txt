<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marella's characterization is strong, with embodied emotion ("heart drumming") and a clear micro-choice to hum indirectly. Her motivation to "discover the texture of time" is dramatized through her actions, and her final choice to speak calmly is earned. A slight deduction for Elder Quillon, who, while functional, remains more of a narrative device than a fully realized secondary character applying pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marella's vision reweights her options, with clear cost felt in the foreseen shattering of possibility. The linkage from her hum to the vision to her final decision is seamless and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient grotto is indispensable, acting as a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. Its description is woven through action and perception ("feeling its cool grain"), and it actively amplifies Marella's hum, making it a causal agent in the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Marella's decision to hum tangentially creates a decisive intensification. The cost is legible in the vision of her failure, forcing a higher-stakes choice. The dominant stake (the reef's fate) is clear and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of navigating transition periods emerges organically from the concrete action of coaxing the cicada and the resulting vision. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("to tune one's speech to its grooves") that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture and a controlled perceptual signature firmly anchored in Marella's POV. The elision of the direct "difficult conversation" is purposeful and taught, paying off at closure. The voice remains consistent and compelling under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery ("the sea comb its fingers through stone"). A minor deduction for a slight rhythm stumble in the long sentence beginning "Within that living chord...," which momentarily slows the accumulative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tidal-pool chronicler, the jade cicada, and the concept of transition periods is highly original and feels inevitable. The choice of an accumulative, lyrical mode is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
