<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with Eira's "softly deliberate" movements and the narrator's motive to "preserve the shape of hope for strangers" revealing complex interiority. The final choice to offer the coat is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Eira's weeping and the folios blossoming new chapters show credible emotional progression layered with contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost as the grandmother congeals "dim but human" and traces letters in pollen, a decisive change that reconfigures meaning. The persistent constraint of the library's charter and the cost of descending shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, from the "blooming library above clouds" to the "desk grown from intertwined quills." The river stone charges the final image, its "translucent heart" flickering with key memories. However, the setting functions more as a rich backdrop than a constraint that directly alters choices, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</comment><grade>Stakes are clearly signaled—to preserve hope and complete a metamorphosis—and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening: the discovery that the silhouette is Eira's grandmother. This revelation changes knowledge and forces the high-agency choice to descend, paid for with the narrator's coat of passwords and the risk of breaking charter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict between memory and forgetting, answered by the non-literal, resonant final image of the book sealed inside the library's roots. The phrase "keep noticing dusk" and the "Persistence of Dusk" title offer a complex, non-moralizing answer to the central question of how hope persists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("my lungs felt filled with dusk instead of oxygen"). The lyrical, patterned compression is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and the elision of how Eira descends and returns is purposeful, trusting the reader without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in peaks ("luminous regret thickened"), but it remains coherent and serves the emotional pressure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure the crucial closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of magical and technological imagery feels inevitable and irreplaceable. The core premise of a library above clouds and shareable dreams is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
