<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ashraf's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in trauma and a bleak desire to hunt the source of his pain. His final choice to sacrifice the geode is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost being the extinction of his last link to his bride. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the hesitation before his decisive act. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic tinge in "bleak exhilaration," though it is quickly anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with undeniable cost, landing on the page as Ashraf extinguishes the geode's light. The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, with because/therefore linkages (e.g., the crystal's frequency guiding the search) and a textural cadence shift at the climax. The final image of the observatory as a "lantern of remorse" reconfigures the stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The geode crystal and the ravaged crater function as micro-settings that critically constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Ashraf's trauma, such as the "glassy weeds whispering static." The floating observatory is more than a postcard; its copper spines and exhausted technicians supply tangible resources and pressure. The environment evolves causally with the energy drain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the hybrid lens, tightening from a hunt to a desperate race to prevent a continental-level catastrophe. The cost is legible on the page when Ashraf must surrender his last connection to his bride. The stake transforms from personal to monumental, forcing a trade-off with visible price. Pressure coheres and intensifies until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of weaponization versus redemption emerges organically from events, resisting a tidy moral. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the premise with the "lantern of remorse" and Ashraf's determination to find "quieter answers." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, like the sparks tracing his bride's silhouette. The bleak exhilaration in equilibrium is earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends the poetic ("sky sang with iron") and the traumatized. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying subtext and advancing the plot, as in Sanaa's cynical laugh about invention becoming ordnance. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional phrases like "intangibly tangible" verge on decorative repetition. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating with the crisis and breathing at the resolution. There is a minor scaffold in the double use of "circuit breakers cool," but it does not obscure closure. The final line is a perfectly weighted image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-tech futurism and primal emotion feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "unfiltered awakening" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in the lyrical, compressed style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise, following its implications without retreat.</comment>
