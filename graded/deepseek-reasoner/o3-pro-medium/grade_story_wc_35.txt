<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kilor's characterization is deeply integrated with his unique ability, and his final choice to enter the pavilion is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality and his own hidden inventory of remorse. His internal conflict is embodied and specific, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost: Kilor's sacrifice and Sel's shamed nod. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through dense imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract cost of Kilor's entombment, which is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The desert fortress and coral pavilion are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting is a crucible, with the pavilion's physical properties driving the plot and the weather mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: Kilor's method fails, leading to the contagion's ricochet and his ultimate offer. The stakes—redistributing versus removing remorse—deepen convincingly, and the cost of Kilor's vigil is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of remorse's intractability emerges organically from the core concept and climax. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kilor's sacrifice and Sel's first unarmored breath, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature filtered through Kilor's professional sensibility. The prose's lyrical density is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, though a slight rhythmic stumble occurs in the final paragraph's longer sentences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and purposeful figurative language. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final paragraph ("unmixed flour") which, while thematically relevant, slightly clashes with the established lexicon of taste under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a chef sandpapering memories via taste is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of culinary and metaphysical concepts feels inevitable in hindsight, and the bold, quiet ending heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
