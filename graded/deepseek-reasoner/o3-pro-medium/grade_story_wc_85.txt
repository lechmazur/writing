<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is embodied and contradictory, driving micro-choices like descending the path and testing the figurines. His final renunciation feels earned by the causal revelation of his drowned twin, with visible cost in the trembling and resolution to catalog truth. No diagnostic self-awareness; emotion is filtered through tactile pressure and sensory degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the watch hand triggers return, figurine test escalates discovery, ledger revelation forces stance crystallization. Closure is a decisive change (renunciation of fraud) with cost legible in "trembling" and "resolved." Orientation is clear by ¶2 with villa, sea, and pocket object anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: terrace frames introspection, shore path narrows options, cave forces confrontation. The watch hand and figurines charge the final image with "pulse of weak light." Sensory detail is selective (salt air, phosphorescent algae) and POV-filtered ("sieved hush").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (weight of truth) tighten through protagonist agency: descent, sifting, testing figurines. Escalation is causal—watch hand enables figurine activation—leading to cave revelation that forces trade-off (fraudulent past vs. truthful future). Cost is visible in "clutched the ledger, trembling."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. fabrication) emerges through particulars: watch hand's ticking, hollow figurines, ledger revelation. Subtext operates in images (sieved hush) and gestures (kneeling). Ending offers non-literal answer via fused carving and resolved regret, reweighting prior fraud without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct ("sieved hush," "tempered regret"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure ("sieved hush became simple night wind"). No head-hopping; perception degrades under stress ("terror swallowed the cool cave air").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats ("hush sifted, sieved hush") slightly muddles clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; momentum accelerates toward cave revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise (black market genealogist confronting erased past) is fresh and fully committed. Transformation via specific lived detail (driftwood saints, kelp-bound ledger). Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable synthesis of guilt and redemption.</comment>
