<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices like tuning "by discarding assumptions" revealing her unique methodology. Her final act of sacrifice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The "serenely electric" trait constrains and enables her actions throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the gorge pausing and the city groaning to life as cost is felt. The lens holds from the opening sensory accumulation through the final transformative image. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices (powerless lifts forcing the glider) and charging the final image (the gorge's pause, the city's unbending). Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the environment mirroring internal states through tactile, lived-in description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from reception to retrieval to active repurposing. The cost is legible in the fragment's spent charge and the gorge's respectful pause. A single meaningful tightening from finding to sacrificing the artifact is sufficient and powerfully executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings is fully integrated into the narrative through concrete action and image, not statement. The final image of the silver ribbon and winking lights offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("moonlight slid," "fog pulsed in squares"). The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs with "like a supervisor satisfied with an employee's shift," which slightly clashes with the mythic tone, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signals and Hollywood ephemera is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The concept of "fantasy practicality" is executed with high conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
