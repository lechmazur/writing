<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied contradictions ("furiously tranquil") that drive micro-choices. The final stance crystallization—writing without fear—is earned by prior causality (the timer ritual and discovered map) with visible cost (carrying the map, accepting uncertainty). The poet's knowledge stays strictly bound; his vigil is a genuine struggle, not a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the poet's internal shift reconfigures his relationship to language and fear. The cost is legible: "He would carry the map until he could decode it, perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow." The pattern of rarefaction and the timer's ritualistic use teach the accumulative design early, and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory is not just backdrop; it constrains choice and charges the final image. The storm pressures the poet's vigil, the dome's glass frames his perception, and the environment evolves with the storm's passage. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the poet's professional and personal priorities ("every breath an exposed plate of silver"). The setting is indispensable to the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (achieving honest language) tightens through the ritual of the timer and the discovery of the map, which deepens his knowledge and reweights the cost. The final choice to write is a decisive intensification that forecloses the path of fear, with a felt price of carrying unresolved pain ("perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of events and images—the timer, the storm, the map—offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how pain can be mapped. The final line, "We breathe so scars can speak," is an earned insight that reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece embraces complexity, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("static haloed each cumulus, making the heavens look like a wounded photograph mid-development"). The voice's lyrical, compressed quality is taught early and maintained under pressure, with syntax and rhythm reflecting the poet's rarefied state. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elision is purposeful and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and legible, serving the accumulative design ("bright arteries across night"). There are no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's needs, accelerating and breathing in step with the poet's internal state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a censored poet, a stormlit observatory, and a cartography of scars feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept of a "vigil in pause" is transformed through grounded, particular choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
