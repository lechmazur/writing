<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in "encrypted compassion," and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final choice to whisper an apology to the mountain is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle, and her internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing on the page with felt cost as "conflicting values had not vanished; they had only been tuned into rough consonance." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through density increases and the repeated motif of "the building breathes." A persistent constraint (the mountain's volatile nature) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and supplying resources (steam, fissures). The antique surveyor's chain constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action, with a clear sensory hierarchy reflecting Mara's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure intensifying through density ("the building breathes again") and a clear, on-page cost: the threat to "defenseless orchid farms." The surge's redirection is a decisive change that narrows options and forces a trade-off, with the cost legible in the settling rubble and Mara's trembling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of harmonizing conflict emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "rough consonance," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The core concept of "encrypted compassion" is fully integrated into the narrative's action and stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature evident in descriptions like "steam curled over volcanic stone, rising like forgotten hymns." The prose has a distinct, controlled texture and rhythmic modulation that heightens pressure. Purposeful elision (the glyph-decoding method) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like frantic silverfish") which, while effective, slightly risks coherence. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is strong and varies effectively with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of geological and emotional engineering feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on conflict resolution, executed with conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of elements is organic and memorable.</comment>
