<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her glass-artist background informing her perception and methods. Her "steadily adaptive" trait is demonstrated through on-page micro-choices, most notably her innovative use of frost to read the ledger. Her final resolve, annealed by anger rather than shattered, is a credible, earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on her occupational identity as a primary motivator, though it remains consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens is established and held: her survival attempt motivates her retreat, which enables the discovery, which dictates her new purpose and escape. Closure is a decisive change (new purpose and action) with a clear, felt cost (ongoing pursuit, narrowed options). The orientation is immediate and the plot mechanics are tight, with the ledger's discovery and interpretation forming a flawless because/therefore chain that escalates cleanly to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting is not merely decorative; it actively constrains choice (acoustics misdirect hunters, shadows provide cover) and charges the final image (the pendant becomes a "silent beacon"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Yara's artistic POV (e.g., "cupped sound like molten glass"). The environment is a dynamic participant in the conflict, not a static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (survival, then exposing the network) and escalate through protagonist agency under the causal lens. The key tightening is the successful reading of the ledger, which narrows her options from hiding to acting and raises the cost by confirming the hunters' persistence. The cost is legible in the final pursuit and her narrowed, deliberate escape route. A single, powerful escalation is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of creation and survival, embodied in the final line: "glass, once cooled, never doubts the shape it has chosen." This is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative, transforming her artistic process into a metaphor for resolve. The subtext of repurposing art for war is powerful and complex, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Yara's profession (e.g., "shards rattling in a kiln"). The voice is consistent and lyrical without becoming overwrought, even under pressure. The prose's rhythm modulates effectively with the scene's tension, and the controlled use of figurative language is always voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple elements of story and character simultaneously. There is no evidence of loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The closing paragraphs are particularly strong, with a cadence that perfectly mirrors the thematic resolution of "cooled glass."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glass artist's sensibility with a survival thriller plot is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific method of revelation (using frost on heat-scarred parchment) is a brilliant, non-obvious inflection that is central to the plot. The concept is fully committed to and executed with authenticity of vision, taking bold risks that pay off in coherence and stakes.</comment>
