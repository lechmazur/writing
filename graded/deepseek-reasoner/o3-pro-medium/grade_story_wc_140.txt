<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in their altered perception, compelling higher-stakes choices like pocketing the poison label. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied emotion ("My throat remembers the metallic sting"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final stance of enduring namelessness is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant Charged Poise crystallizing the narrator's role as witness. Cost is legible on-page in the final paragraph ("identity remains optional... stories can speak louder"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern of collecting fragments teaches early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (labyrinth corridors, tide rhythm) and charging the final image (cranes' skeletal silhouettes). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias (sounds arrive first, images later). The port environment pressures tactics and supplies key resources like the apothecary trunk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: discovering the poison label and recorded voices deepens stakes and narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in the retreat from pursuers and the embrace of namelessness. Pressure coheres through the tide rhythm and urban environment, forcing stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically through events and images (gulls eating ledgers, wind refusing a diary). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of layered notebooks and steel walls rearranging. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like slipping the label as a calling card.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure ("waves slap steel hulls like closing file drawers"). Purposeful elision (e.g., filtered reality) is taught early and paid off. POV is stable and apt, with diction consistently within the narrator's lexicon. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("stacked dusk-coloured tombstones"). Syntax varies naturally with scene needs, and prose is clean with strong verbs and specific nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of bureaucratic ghost and memory collector feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals (poison label's violet age, turquoise paint trail). Emotional truth avoids generic templates through lived detail.</comment>
