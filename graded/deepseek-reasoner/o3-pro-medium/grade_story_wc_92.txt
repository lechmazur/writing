<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Serah's characterization is vivid through micro-choices like drumming knuckles on the crate and her "calmly inventive" trait driving the alternative spark solution. Her internal contradiction—duty-bound sentinel versus rebel—is embodied, not summarized. The final smile, "folded back into the winking hush," shows earned endurance with cost. Aldren is functional but secondary; his role supports without deep exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: blackout complicates their plan, forcing Serah's inventive alternative, leading to lattice lightning awakening the fort. Closure is a Decisive Change (locks open, prisoners freed) with cost felt in the "strangely lighter" fort and Serah's fleeting smile. Orientation is immediate; who, where, when anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; turns are tightly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the blackout pressures tactics, the sundial constrains the solution, and the fort's conduits enable the surge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold air scented with ink and promises"). The quill holder and sundial recur with charged meaning, shaping the climax. Micro-setting (the parchment map) alters choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the blackout forces Serah to innovate, using the sundial motif to redirect the sparks. Cost is legible in the "footfalls dispersed like migrating birds" and the fort's "lighter" heart. One meaningful tightening (blackout complication) suffices; stakes (silent revolution) are tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges through images like doors "yawning like polite giants" and the "winking hush." Subtext operates in gestures (Aldren's salute) and the final reconfiguration of light as liberation. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unlatched doors and Serah's smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with poetic compression ("winking hush") and rhythmic control. POV is stable, filtered through Serah's perception. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Aldren's murmured line carries subtext. Elision (e.g., how quartz stores lightning) is taught and paid off in the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor artifact: "winking hush" repeats, but pattern is taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold; momentum is strong. Figurative language ("lattice lightning crawling") enhances clarity. Peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the "cradle of sparks" concept and silent revolution premise. Synthesis feels inevitable—quartz, sundial, and blackout interlock organically. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors the vision.</comment>
