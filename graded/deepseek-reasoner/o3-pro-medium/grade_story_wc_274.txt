<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ila’s motivation is clear, rooted in professional duty versus moral rebellion, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict is embodied and specific ("her heart bravely conflicted," gloves trembling). The final choice to transmit the letter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when facing the curator. The curator’s introduction adds relational depth without overshadowing Ila’s POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: Ila’s discovery of the letter motivates her rebellion, which escalates logically to transmission and confrontation. Closure is a decisive change (broadcast succeeds, curator allies) with felt cost (risk of discovery, emotional weight). Orientation is immediate and clear; the ending reconfigures the stakes without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (Alcove Seven without cameras, comms crypt under permafrost) and charging the final image (snow-blanketed library listening). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("snow hushed," "ducts humming like monks"). The library itself functions as a character, pressuring Ila’s decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. control) is signaled early and escalates through Ila’s agency—her choice to read, encrypt, and transmit the letter narrows options and raises cost. The curator’s arrival applies coherent pressure, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the risk of discovery and emotional weight of alliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (truth’s power to thaw frozen systems) emerges through concrete actions and images (letter as "contraband truths," transmission as "thaw"). Subtext operates in gesture and implication (curator’s wet eyes, shared silence). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the world shifts") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice ("dizzying quiet," "ink blossoming into voices"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., encryption process) is purposeful and taught. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("sarcophagi of parchment," "pulse drumming"). Minor redundancy in "dizzying quiet" recurrence is offset by its thematic payoff. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of frozen archive and rebellion genres feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, lived-in details (carbon case, admin glyphs, weather buoys) avoid cliché. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed.</comment>
