<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving key choices. Her internal conflict is embodied ("fortified vulnerability and rising fury") and her professional observation anchors her emotional state. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic tone in "empirical observation" during a high-pressure moment, but the final choice to carry the memories is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. The inciting incident (vanished worker) leads directly to the discovery of the lantern, the confession, and the ledgers. Closure is a decisive change with clear, felt cost: Havel's influence "cracked like brittle glass" and the lantern "dulled to ordinary brass," its job done.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is a constraining, pressure-filled micro-setting that dictates movement and choice. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("wet iron and hesitant electricity," "water whispered like pages"). The lantern is a key recurring object that charges the final image and constrains choice, elevating the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (preventable deaths) and escalate through Mara's agency. The discovery of the trapped worker and the ledgers represents a meaningful, causal tightening that narrows options and raises the cost. The final cost is legible in the public exposure of Havel and the lasting "entangled memories."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (vigilance, debt to history, institutional corruption) emerges organically from the discovery of the ledgers and the lantern's magic. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer: "Freedom, prevention, and truth share a corridor, and I intend to patrol it." Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a professional, observant tone. Some minor register drift occurs in the more lyrical lines (e.g., "history exhaled"), which, while effective, slightly distances the narrative from Mara's immediate, empirical perspective in a high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished, dense, and propulsive. Sentences are varied and rhythmic. Figurative language is consistent and effective ("chaos keeps receipts," "voices flickered"). One minor instance of a repetitive stem ("entangled memories" appears three times) prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a magical realist object (lantern) with a gritty, procedural premise is fresh and organic. The concept of "entangled memories" is ingeniously integrated into the plot and theme, transforming a standard investigation into a story about historical debt and vigilance.</comment>
