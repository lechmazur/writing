<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptionally vivid and consistent, with her "thoughtfully spirited" nature driving every action. Her internal conflict—between past ridicule and present purpose—is embodied in her work, culminating in an earned realization that "the safest zone for inquiry begins within." The final choice to follow the coordinates feels motivated by her established traits of stubborn purpose and contemplative curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through sensory details and Mira's reflective micro-choices. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her internal thaw culminates in the active, hopeful decision to pursue the next dome. The cost of her past silence is felt in the memory beat, making her renewed agency and laughter feel earned and significant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "abandoned control room" and "thawing" environment are not just backdrop; they actively pressure Mira's work ("temperature gradients performed treacherous tricks") and mirror her internal state. The dome itself becomes a key object that crystallizes the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift from solitary labor to active pursuit. The dominant stake—creating a "safe zone for inquiry"—tightens as Mira's personal investment deepens, moving from a commissioned task to a deeply personal mission. The cost of her past isolation is the pressure that makes her renewed hope feel weighty and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "thawing"—both external and internal—is intricately woven through concrete action and image, never stated directly. The final realization that safety "begins within" is a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, emerging organically from the juxtaposition of glassblowing, isolation, and the bookmark's clue. It avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through Mira's artistic, contemplative lens. Her habit of "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is a brilliant vocal trait that reveals character and steadies the narrative voice under pressure. The prose rhythm is meticulously controlled, modulating with her emotional state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("landscapes and people revealed cracks," "sunlight spilled... christening the newborn dome"). Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, varying rhythm to match the action, from the careful description of glassblowing to the energetic closing lines. A masterclass in line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The combination of a glassblower in a polar station is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of the "thawing heart" is transformed from a seasonal observation into a profound psychological and thematic framework. The story takes bold risks with its quiet, accumulative structure and lyricism, which pay off in a singular and memorable vision.</comment>
