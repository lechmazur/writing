<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is deeply integrated with her role; her micro-choices (tucking the memory, following the seeds, guiding the glyphs) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in her duty. Her final choice to restore the paths is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the geode's hum and the "dusk-lit elation that still respected loss." Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labels, though a slight tendency toward poetic abstraction in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through density of imagery and pattern (foam, seeds, glyphs) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive change: the map of glimmering paths is restored, with cost legible in the fusion of emotions and the geode's hum. The linkage from question to answer is tight, and the final image reconfigures the story's central absence into presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choice. The iridescent cave and mirror pool are not decorative; they are the mechanism for the climax, with the pool's surface serving as the canvas for revelation. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Mira's professional perspective, creating a lived-in, tactile world that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the initial question from the foam deepens into a tangible absence in the pool, forcing Mira's conjecture and final, costly action of guiding the glyphs. The dominant stake (discovering why paths vanish) is tested concretely, and the cost of the emotional fusion is felt on the page, narrowing options and foreclosing the path of ignorance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of loss and restoration through emotional integration emerges entirely through scene and image, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—paths are consumed by unspoken emotions—that reweights the prior material without moralizing. The final image of the "newly lit path" provides a profound conceptual repricing of absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature firmly anchored in Mira's worldview. Syntax and rhythm modulate perfectly with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "cheerful gloom") is taught early and paid off. There is no head-hopping or register drift, only a coherent and compelling singular perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative pressure. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor clusters in high-pressure beats (e.g., "rainbow echoes painted her shadow in moving mosaics") that, while beautiful, momentarily risk obscuring immediacy. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a "sea-foam recollectionist" is a breathtakingly original synthesis, executed with full commitment to its own unique logic and emotional truth. The combination of elements feels organic and inevitable, not derivative. The risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes and coherence without ever becoming a gimmick, resulting in a singular artistic vision.</comment>
