<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ruen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance shift from ambition to function feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the sealed corridor. The elm fossil as transitional object concretizes internal conflict without diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern density increasing through sensory layers until the fissure event triggers closure. Conceptual Repricing occurs when Ruen becomes "the hinge that sings," reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate and deliberate disorientation proves functional at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image through the obsidian corridor and fossilized plankton constellations. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through professional priorities. The cave network functions as both environment and character, with spatial choreography that tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with the fissure event serving as meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible in the sealed corridor and instrument power-down. Dominant stake of becoming a voice tightens through emotional heat-mapping and the fossil's guidance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image patterns rather than statement, with the elm fossil and emotional mapping serving as particulars that resist abstraction. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer through the "blank wall asking for its first story." Subtext operates powerfully in the fossil's transformation and the corridor's invitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled poetic compression that serves Accumulative design. POV remains stable and consistent, with diction matching Ruen's professional specificity. Elision is purposefully taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift despite elevated language.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("inverted cathedrals," "tidal arteries") serves pattern-building. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports the Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping, dream residue, and geological mysticism that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transforms the "explorer" trope through specific emotional cartography. No template plotting or derivative premises.</comment>
