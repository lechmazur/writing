<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is strong, though occasional abstraction ("Despair threatened to flood me") slightly reduces peak-beat specificity. Final choice to invert power is earned through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting stakes. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing through mathematical transformation of mercy, with cost legible in drone relaxation and forest whispering. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest constrains choices and charges the final image magnificently. Sensory details are purposefully selective and POV-filtered, with environment actively shaping tactics. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout movement sequences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with mathematical progression creating meaningful deepening. Cost is unmistakable in pain translation and drone confrontation. Single tightening sufficient for length, with stakes evolving from survival to conceptual breakthrough.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Themes of mercy, mathematics, and trauma integrate organically through events and images. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through mathematical transformation. Avoids moralizing while maintaining complexity through the one-over-zero paradox resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation. Purposeful compression and mathematical diction remain voice-consistent. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("luminous, recursive, unfinished") but maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in mathematical passages ("vertices breathed") creates slight abstraction but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold issues, with strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of mathematics, trauma, and mercy concepts feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with mathematical metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals through unique voice and perspective.</comment>
