<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurora's characterization is flawlessly embodied through contradictory impulses—her empirical training clashes with mystical intuition, and her jealousy-fueled dismissal of Jory compounds the central conflict. Her final choice to etch the mirror symbol is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her confrontation with Jory's cinder form. Micro-choices under pressure, like dropping the tin disc into molten gold, reveal a hierarchy of values that align with her motive to redeem her failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure building through symbolic density and cadence shifts rather than causal linkages. The cost is legible when gold threads weave through Jory's fissures, sealing them with "luminous admission." Orientation is immediate; the taught pattern of alchemical transformation pays off at closure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The foundry functions as a micro-setting that constrains choices—the anvil, furnace, and slag heaps pressure Aurora's actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her expertise (e.g., "crucibles glow white while her pulse counts slow"). The zodiac coin and ceramic jar recur with reweighted meaning, actively shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aurora's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, intensifying through symbolic acts (melting the coin, etching the mirror) that deepen stakes. The cost is unmistakable when she witnesses "every crack her pride inflicted" in the mirror. One meaningful tightening—her confession—reweights options and forces a trade-off between pride and redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through kintsugi imagery and alchemical processes, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption through "exalting fracture," with the final image of the "reforged zodiac coin" reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like Jory's "fingertips crumbling like charcoal yet glowing within."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by alchemical lexicon ("auric memory," "kintsugi intentions"). Diction remains within Aurora's plausible register, even under stress. Elision is purposeful—e.g., Jory's vanishing into "molten shadow" is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent (e.g., "kintsugi" recurs meaningfully). Minor artifact: "like glass glimpsing the hammer" risks slight abstraction but does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax ("alloy snarls, then sings").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes alchemy and kintsugi into a fresh, inevitable whole. The mirror symbol is a non-obvious inflection that transforms the premise through character-specific moral calculus. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core concept feels organic, not derivative.</comment>
