<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's "logically emotional" interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the climax where frequencies "read her intentions as if bone were parchment." Her micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Callix is slightly less dimensional, but his role as a catalyst is functional for the scope. The final endurance is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal/accumulative) holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: Callix collapses, "offering absolution no cheaper than sin." Orientation is immediate and precise. The only minor flaw is the crypt key's late introduction, but its integration is causally sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choices (e.g., tuning forks on hulls, copper wire on breakwater) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through a professional POV. The environment is a active participant, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: the raiders' arrival forces the activation of their prepared defense. The stake (protecting the artifact) is clear and the cost is legible on the page in the raiders' defeat and Callix's collapse. A single, meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image, not statement. The concept of "sonic absolution" is explored through the concrete mechanism of the barricade, which tests heart motives. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of weaving "gears, water, and breath into guarded night."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, engineer-filtered voice. The prose has a distinct lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. The elision of the key's backstory is purposeful and paid off in its functional use. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught ("clinked like glassware," "molecular sympathy"). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with the raiders' approach. Zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering and sonic mysticism is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through grounded, lived-in detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in the lyrical, high-concept prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
