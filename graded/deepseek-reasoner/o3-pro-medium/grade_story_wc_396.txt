<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her "calmly intuitive" nature and embodied emotion ("doubts curled like smoke"). Her final choice to partner with Silas is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("testing sincerity the way sailors tested rigging") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the bond forms and the sea "recalibrates," reconfiguring the stakes with felt cost. The mirror's mechanics are slightly ambiguous, causing a minor causality question that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are vividly rendered and actively pressure choices (e.g., "boots skidding on frost," "ice cracked to reveal tunnels"). The setting constrains tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens: her decision to follow the vision and descend into the tunnels narrows options and raises the cost. The stakes ("storm season," "structural ruin") are concrete and the cost of action is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of empathy and action, culminating in the resonant, non-literal realization that the "courageous anomaly was never a lone hero." The final image offers a complex answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture ("Cold awe fluttered through Mara"). Dialogue is minimal but functional and goal-driven. The elision of the mirror's exact rules is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a slight template cadence in "Branches clicked, pelagic wind sighed, and the world seemed to hold breath," which mildly dulls immediacy in a key beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse, orchard, ice floes, and emotional cartography is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
