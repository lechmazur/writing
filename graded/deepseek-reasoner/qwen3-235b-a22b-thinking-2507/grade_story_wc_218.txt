<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris embodies contradictory impulses (calm acceptance vs urgent purpose) through concrete micro-choices like precise copper wrapping. His final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in raw hands and tight lungs. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, particularly in the climax where peace "floods him" as a physical sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensification (diary entries, copper applications) culminates in the tremor/pulse revelation, a decisive cadence shift. Closure is Charged Poise—the sparrow on copper wire crystallizes the pact's endurance with conceptual cost (Aris's mortality) legible in "time, for once, felt sufficient."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (muddy paths hinder copper hauling) and charges the final image (stone pillars softening at wire contact). Sensory detail is purposefully selective (rain's tactile impediment, pulse felt through cool stone). The orchard evolves from passive backdrop to sentient participant, directly shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases via diary entries and weather obstacles, reweighting the stake (interspecies respect) through Aris's deteriorating stamina. Cost is legible in his raw hands and tight lungs, though the villagers' scoffing remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally pressing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (copper wire as "translation," diary as "manifesto"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the sparrow's warmth on copper, reweighting the pact without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (stone yielding, root honoring) rather than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with perceptual signature ("brazen calm," stone "sighing"). Diction remains within Aris's expertise (botanical, architectural). Elision (villagers' exact words) is purposeful, charging the final image. Minor register drift in "architectural secret" feels slightly narrative-voiced but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic ("copper wire, thin and pliable, coiled in his palm like a promise"). Figurative language serves character and pressure. One minor loop: "brazen calm" repeats three times, slightly ornamental but pattern-taught. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological fantasy and mortal urgency. Premise commits fully—living stone pillars are transformed through specific, tactile detail (mineral release, lattice fragility). Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
