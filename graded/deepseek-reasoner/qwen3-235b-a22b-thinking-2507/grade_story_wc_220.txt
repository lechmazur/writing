<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is deeply rooted in sensory memory and loss, compelling his high-stakes choice to follow the map. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion (e.g., tears blurring vision). The final renunciation of digging for the dead is earned by the prior causality of discovering the cylinder and solving its riddle, with visible cost in his altered purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) from searching for an end to pursuing a path back, landing with cost ("Tears blurred his vision"). The drive lens is Causal, held throughout: the discovery of the cylinder directly causes the attempt to play it, which causes the idea to use the leaf, which reveals the map. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The scrapyard setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, supplying the cylinder and constraining movement. The leaf and phonograph function as micro-settings, crucially constraining the choice to solve the riddle and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Silas's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Silas's discovery, experimentation, and ingenuity in using the leaf to read the cylinder. The cost is unmistakable—the flare of hope, the frustration, and the final, tearful realization reweight the dominant stake of finding closeness from one of loss to one of potential reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of translating distance into closeness emerges organically from the specific elements of the leaf, cylinder, and map, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the eastward path and the symbol of sanctuary, reweighting the prior material of loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Silas's canine sensory perception, creating a distinct and consistent perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical, descriptive texture is voice-motivated and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slightly mixed metaphor in a peak beat ("Hope, sharp and sudden, flared in his chest" juxtaposes tactile "sharp" with visual "flared"), but it does not obscure closure. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bloodhound protagonist in a post-apocalyptic setting with a tactile, non-audio recording method is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "tinted revelations" is fully integrated and transforms the familiar trope of a found message into a fresh, ingenious mechanism that drives the plot and character.</comment>
