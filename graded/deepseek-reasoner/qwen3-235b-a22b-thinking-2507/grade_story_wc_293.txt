<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("its cold edge biting his thigh"). The final choice to play the bridge-song is earned by prior causality—the discovery of the bow with growing moss reconfigures his relationship to brokenness. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the fiddler plays a reborn bridge-song, with cost legible in the snapped bow and glowing moss. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern breaks (tarp flutters mapping a path) and cadence shifts reweight the stake. The final image recharges prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—the scaffold tarp's flutters map a secret route, and the canyon ledge is invisible from the pullout. The glass flake and bow function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: his observation of the tarp's pattern narrows options to one hidden path. Cost is legible in the descent on shifting shale and the discovery of the broken bow. The dominant stake (sculpting possibility from "never") tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the bow sprouting moss—broken things can grow anew. Theme emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The core concept (pixelated amnesty) integrates fully with theme through specific particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dynamically observant") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression (the hitchhiker's vanishing) is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and apt, with diction consistent to the fiddler's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, though minor register elevation exists ("luminous glyph").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate photography, railroad signals, and bridge mythology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
