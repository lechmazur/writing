<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (tracing cracks, placing the stone) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her exhaustion and desperate need for peace are felt costs that earn her final repose. The final renunciation (discarding the map) feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing with undeniable cost ("Exhaustion washed over her, deeper than any she’d known"). The pattern of sensory density (sound, light, touch) escalates coherently to a decisive cadence shift at the bloom of hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not just backdrop; they are the central conflict. The ice formations and their crack patterns constrain Elara's choice and directly charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, reflecting her professional priorities as a mapkeeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a coherent density increase of dissonant energy, culminating in a single decisive intensification at the locus. The stake (finding quiet) is signaled early and tested by the invasive noise. The cost is the profound exhaustion that follows the conjuring, a visible price on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>The theme of finding harmony within chaos emerges entirely through event and image, not statement. The final image of the "bloom of hush" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the storm's dissonance into the deep, resonant calm without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's professional, sensory-specific perception. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, especially under pressure ("the resonant hum... had become a jagged, dissonant shriek"). The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("a visible wave of absolute silence, cool and pure as mountain air"), which slightly softens the impact of the decisive moment. Otherwise, clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of geologic mapping, acoustic harmony, and energy beings feels fresh and organic. The core concept of inverting sound into silence is ingenious and specific, not a generic trope. The story commits fully to its premise, and the resolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
