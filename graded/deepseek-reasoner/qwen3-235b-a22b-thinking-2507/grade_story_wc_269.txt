<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with Aris's motivation rooted in witnessed trauma. His tapping rhythm is a concrete, character-particular trait that reveals his internal state under pressure. The final endurance is earned by the causality of his investigation, though the emotional cost feels slightly summarized at the very end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered data and sensory detail toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The delayed revelation that the coral scaffolds perished is the decisive change, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("some losses were irreversible"). Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station and the atlas page are not just described; they actively constrain Aris's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional and emotional priorities. The setting is integral to the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency in assembling evidence, culminating in the delayed revelation that narrows his options and forecloses hope. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraphs. The dominant stake (discovery) is signaled early and tightens convincingly under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of coral bleaching and sonar voids, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about irreversible loss through the conceptual repricing of the fossil fuel ban's limitations. The final image etches the cost in the "bones of the earth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Aris's scientific yet sorrowful perspective. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that mirrors the sea's pulse and his mental state. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon, and elision (e.g., the exact moment of revelation) is purposeful and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing. A slight register elevation in "etched not in policy but in the bones of the earth" is voice-motivated and serves the conceptual repricing, causing no clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate change aftermath with a scientific mystery feels fresh and specific. The core concept of paths vanishing due to dead coral scaffolds is a non-obvious, ingenious angle on a familiar theme. The execution is organic, though the concept is more transformative than the structural approach.</comment>
