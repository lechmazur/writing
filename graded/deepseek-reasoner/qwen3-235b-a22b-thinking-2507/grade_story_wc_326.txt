<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma, and intensifies to compel her high-stakes choice to accept the corrupted data. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, exemplified by the embodied act of counting heartbeats as defiance. The final choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of seeking a clean signal with a visible cost—the acceptance of a corrupted, refracted truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that failure is a refraction, not an end, reweights the entire premise. The inferred Causal lens holds tightly, with her actions (tracing the ink, inputting coordinates) directly causing the ghost's emergence and its final dissolution into coherent data. Cost is legible in the final image of her counting heartbeats, alive in the snow, having paid the price of isolation to gain this wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively pressuring the character and constraining her choices through isolation and resource limitation. Key objects—the porcelain shard and inkwell—are not described but used, their evolving functions critical to the plot's progression and the final charged image of the ink-stained console.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens: her method of using the ink pattern to defragment the core is a unique, self-generated pressure that meaningfully tightens her options. The cost is unmistakable, crystallizing in the final command where she accepts the corruption, a trade-off that forever alters her understanding of the event that tried to erase her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme—that wisdom and truth are found in broken, refracted states—is fully integrated and emerges with profound resonance from the specific events. The ending offers a non-literal, earned answer through the final image and the conceptual repricing of failure, completely avoiding moralizing or summary. The core concept of the digital ghost is the perfect vehicle for this exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a distinct, perceptive signature, blending technical observation with lyrical introspection, all filtered through Elara's unique worldview. POV is stable and deeply embedded; the prose's rhythm and diction consistently reflect her state of focused, solitary urgency. Purposeful compression is used effectively, taught early with the ink patterns and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("silence had settled like fresh powder") is precise, purposeful, and never muddled. There are zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; the read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling, especially in the closure paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic signal, a bureaucratic error, and a character using spilled ink to decode a machine is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Bold risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
