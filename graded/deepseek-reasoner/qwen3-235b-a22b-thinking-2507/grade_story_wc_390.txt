<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("ache in his molars") and micro-choices under pressure (minute key adjustments). The final endurance is earned by prior causality and has visible cost (slumping against the glass, stained coat).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the faltering harmonics (inciting incident) force Aris's climb and tuning attempt (therefore), culminating in a decisive change (restored resonance) with felt cost (effort, relief). Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, actively pressuring choices (ice groans, sunset timer). The marina and key function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image of peaceful stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (artifact protection) are signaled early. Pressure escalates causally via the sunset timer and worsening ice groans, forcing a high-agency climax (vibrational matching) with a clear, earned cost (physical and mental exertion).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (absolution through adaptation) emerges organically from the core concept and action, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the struggle ("absolution not for sins, but for the world's raw, trembling fragility").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by engineering expertise. Diction and syntax reflect his logical-emotional state under pressure. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing that slightly obscures immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor artifact penalty (-0.2) for a slight template cadence in the climax ("He adjusted... he held") and one potentially mixed metaphor ("flapping like a wounded bird").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic magic, and emotional struggle feels fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The final reconfiguration is earned and inevitable.</comment>
