<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kenji’s motivation is clear, pure, and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. His actions are deliberate and character-driven, culminating in a final ritual that feels earned by his reverence. The final choice to brew tea as acknowledgment is a perfect micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. A hairline deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("a testament to fleeting beauty") in a peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the entire world is reweighted as humming with hidden effort. Causality is impeccable, with each discovery building on the last through observation and experimentation. The cost is the profound, quiet realization of universal labor, felt in the final image of the cooled tea and dimming fireflies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parapet is not merely a setting but the central instrument of the revelation, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite, purposeful, and deeply filtered through Kenji's professional perception. The environment is a fully integrated character, its whispered secrets and vibrations essential to the plot's progression and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates beautifully through a cadence shift from observation to active experimentation (dipping a finger, using the whisk, whistling). Each step is driven by Kenji's agency and deepens his knowledge, narrowing his focus toward the final, decisive act of ritual acknowledgment. The stakes of appreciating unseen labor are made viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of hidden effort emerges organically from the confluence of net-mending, firefly metabolism, and the fortress's song. It is complex, resisting a tidy moral in favor of a resonant, somber appreciation. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer through the final image of the teacup as a "living canvas," perfectly synthesizing the story's core concepts without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a seamless blend of poetic observation and philosophical depth that remains strictly bound to Kenji's perception. Syntax and rhythm modulate perfectly with the rising pressure of discovery. The purposeful elision of other characters focuses the POV intensely, and the lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "scintillatingly somber" feels slightly over-engineered and register-drifted for Kenji's voice, creating a tiny stumble in an otherwise flawless peak beat. This prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary, with high density and zero loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The combination of a net-mender philosopher using a tea whisk to decipher a stone parapet's song is wholly unique and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is executed with bold risk-taking that coheres perfectly, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic vision.</comment>
