<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in inherited trauma; interiority is concrete and embodied ("pressing his small face against the cool slats"). The final choice to hover feels slightly under-motivated on a character level, leaning on magical realism rather than a purely earned psychological shift, but the emotional progression is credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the boy leaves his past behind for an uncertain silence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. A minor deduction for the "hover" mechanism, which feels like a late-breaking rule change not fully taught by the pattern of the confessional's magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices; the lighthouse prison and jagged reef are integral. The lattice and the "scuffs on the narrow door" function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—the discovery of bodies forces his move. The cost of abandoning his old life is legible. The stakes are clear and tighten effectively, though the magical resolution slightly softens the visceral pressure of the escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited lies and the pursuit of silence is deeply integrated, emerging from concrete particulars (the lattice, the father's fate). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of vanishing into the sea, reweighting the concept of "chasing hush" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, compressed texture that reflects the POV's heightened state. Purposeful elision ("He didn't walk; he began to hover") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor deduction for a slight ornate flourish in "copperlight repose," which feels slightly register-elevated for the POV, but it is consistent and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh, ingenious synthesis of the "cry wolf" fable into a gritty, magical realist context. The concept feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without becoming gimmicky. The lattice as a talisman is a particularly original inflection.</comment>
