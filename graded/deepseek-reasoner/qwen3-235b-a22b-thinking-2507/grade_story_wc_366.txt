<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's reticence and warm observation are embodied through specific micro-choices, like tracing the cold glass and methodically stacking stones. Her motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" crystallizes from a reflective block that tilts her present stance, though the initial link from the letter's cryptic message to this profound need feels slightly abrupt. The final renunciation—leaving the crates to build cairns—is an Earned Stasis with visible cost, rooted in her established values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density of image and pattern (letters, sea glass, stones) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with cost: "the ache in her heart not fading but glowing—a lighthouse of the soul." Orientation is immediate; who, where, and when are anchored by the second sentence. The persistent constraint of the extinguished lamp shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room and shingle beach are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The dead lamp's seized mechanism forces the cairn-building solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional familiarity, like noting "the faint scent of brine and old fear." The sea glass and stones function as micro-settings that evolve in meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from observation to action—the decision to build cairns—that reweights the dominant stake (safety for strangers) with cost. The pressure coheres from the lamp's failure through the letters to the final, purposeful stacking of stones. Agency is a renunciation (not relighting) that forecloses a path, and the cost of this endurance is legible in the "luminescent ache" and the untouched supply crates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of failed technology and human continuity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of safety—it is not in the light itself but in the quiet rebellion of passed-down care. Subtext operates powerfully in the sea glass and the cairns, which are "a language older than words." Avoids moralizing; the resolution is complex and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Elara's perceptive, maritime-tinged voice. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity, from the thick, ghostly atmosphere of the lantern room to the calm precision of the beach. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon ("salt-stung," "shingle beach"). There is no dialogue, but the internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the luminescent ache settled in her chest—a soft, blue sorrow"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative mode. Sentences advance multiple jobs of character, setting, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a haunted lighthouse, an anonymous letter chain, and a stone-stacking language feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The emotional truth—finding safety in continuity rather than light—feels authentic and insightful. The unconventional, quiet ending is a bold risk that heightens meaning and coherence.</comment>
