<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (honesty vs. familial duty) act simultaneously in scene, compelling her higher-stakes choice. Her final calculus is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of trading her father's criminal knowledge for his freedom. Embodied emotion is specific and concrete, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: Elara's active waiting and calculations directly cause Agent Reynolds's reconsideration. Closure is a decisive change (proposal accepted) with felt cost (risk, moral compromise) legible in the final image of the glinting ink pot. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies thematic resonance. The vintage ink pot is a recurring object that constrains choice (enabling her calculations) and decisively charges the final image, making it indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Elara’s internal calculations tighten the options, culminating in her proposal. The cost—leveraging her father’s criminality for a state asset—is legible and reweights the dominant stake of asylum, though the external pressure from the official is slightly static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "mathematics of fairness" emerges organically from events and the central object, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the finalized proposal and the glinting ink pot, reweighting the value of truth and deception without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact proposal details) is taught and pays off. A minor register drift ("deathly vitality") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A slight tendency toward elevated diction ("deathly vitality") creates a minor register drift in a high-pressure beat, but it is consistent with the voice and does not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a funeral home, a con artist's child, and a magical ink pot feels organic and fresh. The core concept of negotiating asylum through a "fair trade" calculus is a non-obvious, ingenious angle on a familiar political theme, fully committed to and executed with specificity.</comment>
