<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo's skepticism and curiosity are concrete and consistent, driving his exploration and eventual transformation. His embodied emotion ("muscles straining against its unexpected heft") and micro-choices under pressure (dropping then reclaiming the valve) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—carrying the weight toward absolution—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: the valve discovery → radio confession → realization of truth tightens options and knowledge. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Leo becomes "keeper of the swallowed truth," with cost legible in "its weight now a compass pointing toward absolution." Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tunnel setting actively pressures choices through damp gloom, cold seepage, and spatial constraints. The valve wheel functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image—its beads "clicking like counting bones" and evolving meaning anchor the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Leo's professional curiosity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: Leo's appraisal of the valve, triggered by the radio confession, forces a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (uncovering truth) tightens through a meaningful deepening—realizing the valve embodies "the crushing lightness of a lie." Cost is felt in the dropping and reclaiming of the object.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and absolution emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the valve's weight transforms from metal to moral burden. Subtext operates in silence ("the hush after confession") and reweighted objects (beads glinting with "wetness that wasn't tunnel damp"). Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Leo's skepticism and geological focus. Diction remains within his lexicon ("appraise with a geologist's focus"). Radio dialogue feels natural and advances plot through subtext and revelation. No head-hopping or register drift; elision (the caller's identity) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without artifacts. Figurative language ("beads clicking like counting bones") is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentences vary in structure and accelerate with pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; closure image is clear and unblurred by prose issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of industrial exploration and supernatural confession feels fresh and inevitable. The valve wheel is a unique, irreplaceable object that transforms from curiosity to moral symbol. Risk-taking in blending radio broadcast with physical discovery heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes or template plots.</comment>
