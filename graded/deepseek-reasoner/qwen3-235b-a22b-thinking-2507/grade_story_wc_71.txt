<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara is a fully realized character whose specific perception ("creeping normality noticer") drives every action. Her motivation to understand houses is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (testing the cottages) and culminates in an earned, embodied epiphany. The final realization that houses are "held" by care is rooted in her prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot coheres through pattern and cadence shifts. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final realization reweights the premise of "alive" houses with a clear, felt cost ("Tears pricked Elara’s eyes"). The orris root's introduction is slightly convenient but is quickly integrated into the established method, causing no break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely decorative; it actively constrains and enables choice. The bay supplies the test objects (sea stone, orris root), and the houses themselves function as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's unique perception, making the environment a crucible for the thematic revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding houses) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens. Each test is a meaningful tightening that deepens her knowledge and narrows her focus to the Finnegan place. The cost is legible in the emotional weight of the final realization and the fragile warmth returning to the house.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically and powerfully from the particulars of the ritual and the objects. The final, profound realization—"houses felt alive because they were sanctified by the displaced objects of human care"—is a non-literal, earned answer to the central question that reconfigures all prior material without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptive texture that reflects Elara's character. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through her specific way of seeing ("streetlights daydreamed"). The prose's rhythm modulates perfectly with the emotional pressure, from quiet observation to the hushed blaze of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single, very minor quibble: "inadvertently profound" leans slightly toward telling, but it is immediately anchored in the concrete action of her work and is therefore a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements with remarkable originality and ingenuity. The core concept of a "shard of hush" and the method of "displaced objects" feel fresh, inevitable, and wholly integrated into the character's worldview and the story's emotional logic. The specific, lived-in details prevent any sense of template or trope.</comment>
