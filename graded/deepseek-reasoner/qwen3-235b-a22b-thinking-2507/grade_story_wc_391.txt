<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority ("her breath a soft plume") and micro-choices under pressure. Her calm counters the young man's anger, revealing hierarchy of values. Final endurance feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern of moon/viaduct imagery converging at closure. Orientation is immediate. Closure lands with cost ("cool and light. Sculpted") as collective stillness unyokes chains. One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen lake and magnetic viaduct constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ice sang with tension"). Basalt sanctuary could be more integrated but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unyoking fear) escalates through villager gathering and young man's challenge. Agency is renunciation/endurance under accumulative lens. Cost is legible in "soft groan of iron yielding".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges through concrete particulars without moralizing. Final image ("Sculpted") offers resonant non-literal answer. Moon/viaduct motifs charge closure without being token.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. POV remains stable and consistent. Minor density in peak beats doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Generally excellent prose with high information density. Minor figurative density in climax ("ice sang with tension") slightly obscures cause-effect but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution through patience motif. Specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
