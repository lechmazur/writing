<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, with consistent micro-choices under pressure (e.g., seeking the cathedral). Her final transformation from mourning to creation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional struggle. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though a slight reliance on told emotion ("felt most herself") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: Leo's postcard motivates her search, leading to the cathedral climax. Closure is a decisive change (emotional shift to creation) with felt cost ("quietly driven by a question"). Orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of grief shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Settings (pavilion, cathedral) are vividly rendered and constrain choices—the pavilion's chill prevents deciphering, forcing the cathedral visit. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("amber pavilion’s wooden slats warm against her back"). The cathedral window charges the final image by enabling the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates through protagonist agency—her active attempt to decode postcards leads to the cathedral. Cost is legible in her emotional realization and altered action (creating the mural). Pressure tightens under the causal lens, narrowing options until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (night-blooming flowers, cathedral light) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief ("some truths bloom only when we stop demanding answers"). Subtext in Leo's messages deepens the thematic weight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, artist-filtered perceptual signature ("fractured beams of amber and cobalt"). Diction remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful elision (hidden messages) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure ("dawning hush pressing around her like a velvet glove"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Rhythm varies naturally, though occasional complex syntax may slightly slow readability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, botany, and art feels inevitable in hindsight. The cathedral window method is innovative and irreplaceable. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, and risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transforms tropes through grounded particulars.</comment>
