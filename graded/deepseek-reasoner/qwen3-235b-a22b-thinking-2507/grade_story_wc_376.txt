<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits (wilting near dishonesty, calligrapher's precision). Her internal conflict and growth are shown through embodied reactions (wilting at Ben's lie) and micro-choices (whispering fears to fit map pieces). The final bloom is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her physical collapse earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: map discovery leads directly to piecing via candor, culminating in the console activation. Closure is a decisive change (accessing voices) with felt cost (emotional weight of lost conversations regained). Orientation is immediate; the zinc plate fragment authenticates the map's origin, tightening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is integral and pressures choices (toxic sky, greenhouse tremor). The banyan tree constrains the climax (roots coil around console) and charges the final image (bark parting). Sensory details (overripe orchids, recycled condensation) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (lost conversations) are signaled early and escalate through Ben's dishonesty and map-piecing. Protagonist agency drives tightening: her admissions ("I miss my sister's voice") narrow options and enable the final path. Cost is legible in her wilting and emotional vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (candor reassembles what force cannot) emerges through action (whispered fears fitting map pieces) and the final image (voices flowing into her). It offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The zinc plate's reprise as a key reinforces thematic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct ("spine softening like sun-scorched celery"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Ben's smooth lie). Elision is purposeful (map's origin hinted via zinc plate). Minor register drift in "magnetic pollen" slightly offsets peak pressure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong verbs ("traced," "hammering"). Figurative language is mostly effective, though "magnetic pollen" feels slightly forced. No loops or scaffolding; closure image is clear. Minor overwriting in "sun-scorched celery" metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh (truth-sensitive calligrapher in toxic greenhouse city). Tropes (treasure map) are transformed through specific mechanics (candor-based assembly). Synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking in emotional vulnerability heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
