<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction—skepticism warring with latent belief—is embodied in her white knuckles and scoffing dismissal of the tile, yet her compelled transcription under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Her final choice to share the transcriptions, despite social cost, is earned by the vision's visceral proof and her mentor's echoed purpose. The micro-choice to descend the tower with journal clutched demonstrates credible endurance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: the tile's discovery (because of her mentor's death) triggers the vision (therefore proving entanglement), which forces her to act (therefore risking her standing to save the whales). Closure is a decisive change (skeptic to witness) with cost legible in her "raw but resolute" voice and the warm tile repurposed. One meaningful tightening (vision reveals dredging's star-warping effect) sufficiently escalates stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tower and tile function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the tower isolates her, while the tile's cool-then-warm stone actively enables the vision and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt spray, bruised twilight, humming obsidian—filtered through Elara's professional stargazer bias. Spatial choreography is clean, from telescope adjustment to floorboard hiding spot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whale survival) is signaled early via shipping lane danger. Escalation is driven by agency: Elara chooses to use the tile, transcribe the patterns, and present them to villagers. Cost is unmistakable in "risking the last respect she held" and her "hands steady despite the fear." One meaningful tightening (vision reveals cause of path change) forces a trade-off between social credit and action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (interconnection through time/species) emerges through concrete particulars: whale songs, star-glyphs, and harpoon scars in the vision. Subtext operates in the tile's shimmer and the fisherman's nod. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"sculpting space for repair"—through the image of the breaching whale catching sunrise, reweighting prior skepticism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptual signature: "bruised twilight sky," "songs strained and unfamiliar." Diction reflects her expertise ("entangled memories," "transcribe") without register drift. Internal voice modulates under stress ("dread that coiled in her chest") but remains coherent. The single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting; sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "Salt spray... carried the distant, mournful songs" establishes setting, mood, and plot). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the vision sequence. No loops or scaffold artifacts. One minor strain: "unheard symphony" slightly leans toward abstraction but is redeemed by concrete follow-up ("palpable thrum").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whale migration, cosmic mythology, and ecological stakes feels organic and inevitable. The magic square tile is a non-obvious vehicle for "entangled memories" transformed through specific use. Risk-taking in the lyric vision sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, grounded in Elara's particular struggle.</comment>
