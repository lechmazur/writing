<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply integrated with her actions; her "blithe spirit" contrasts with her "solemn focus," showing contradictory impulses in scene. Her final understanding of Silas's warning is earned by her meticulous decoding, with the cost legible in the "weight of understanding settling upon her." No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary; interiority is concrete and embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the decoded message reconfigures the cemetery's quiet from "empty" to "filled with echoes," with cost felt in the weight of understanding. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through decoding density; the pattern holds. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (cemetery, silo, task).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "velveteen gloom," "cold stone"). The environment pressures Elara's decoding and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The silo's description ("drink the starlight") is irreplaceable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's decoding agency under the Accumulative lens, with stakes tightening through glyph matching. Cost is legible in the "weight of understanding" and the revaluation of the cemetery's silence. One meaningful deepening (the plea for remembrance) suffices for length; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (remembrance, intention) emerges through decoding particulars, not statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the "constellation of meaning," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the tapestry's whispers and Silas's absence. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "drink the starlight"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., shorter phrases during decoding). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., Silas's backstory) is taught and paid off. Minor register elevation in peak beats but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("drink the starlight") is pattern-taught and purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. One minor artifact: "velveteen gloom" repeats, but it reinforces tone and is legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes cemetery gardening, decoding, and mystical echoes into a non-obvious whole. The sovereign case and uncharted echoes are irreplaceable. Risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
