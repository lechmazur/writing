<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in her retrocognitive trait and sworn duty, compelling her high-stakes choice to rekindle the beacon. Her conviction is embodied in trembling hands and hitched breath, not told. The final endurance is earned, though the climax's reliance on coincidence slightly tempers the agency of her final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the beacon's soft glow and thistle seeds reweighting meaning with palpable cost ("tears cutting paths through the dust"). The lens holds, though the climax's heavy coincidence complicates the causality of the final success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and broken prism are not just described but actively constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action, reflecting her urgency and the setting's mournful tone. The environment is a crucible, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Elara's precise, agency-driven actions under the Accumulative lens. The final convergence with Vega is a meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in her trembling and tears, though the resolution's heavy reliance on cosmic coincidence slightly mutes the price of her specific effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of meaning in chaos, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with the beacon's soft glow and swirling thistles. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity and hope earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose is lush but purposeful, with elision (e.g., "thistle-blown hope") taught and paid off. Minor register drift in the peak beat ("universe was answering") is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor register drift occurs in the high-pressure climax ("universe was answering"), leaning slightly toward declarative theme statement, but it does not obscure closure clarity or cause significant artifact issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, a silent shard, and cosmic patterns feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully, and the specific, grounded details (glass humming pavilion, thistles) create a singular artistic stance that avoids generic post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
