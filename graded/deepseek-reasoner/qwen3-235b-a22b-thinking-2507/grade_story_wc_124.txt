<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is concrete and deeply rooted in sensory grief, compelling his high-stakes choice. His internal conflict between caution and desperate curiosity is embodied in his trembling fingers and "aromatic caution." The final renunciation—to tend the light rather than broker more perfumes—is earned by the climactic revelation. A slight deduction for the backstory block nearing the 20% limit, though it successfully anchors in the present vial and alters his stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a charged poise where Silas's understanding is reconfigured, with cost legible in the "single, hot tear" and the dimming Bloom. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The final image reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not a backdrop but a crucible, constraining choice through volatile pollen and fragile equilibrium. The vial and Bloom charge the final image, its "crystal shadows" reconfiguring meaning. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Silas's expertise, with the Kauri ferns' "sweet decay" and lantern glow creating a cohesive, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the Bloom's transformation completes, forcing the vial's use. Silas's agency drives the climax; his choice to uncork the vial narrows options and reveals the cost. The stake—understanding grief—is visceral and paid for with the loss of his brokering purpose, foreclosing that path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the climax: scent as a key to "synesthetic grief." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"memories weren’t stored in the nose, but in the heart"—that reweights the story without moralizing. Subtext operates in the vial's handling and the Bloom's "closing eyes," embracing complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Silas's expertise. Diction remains within his lexicon ("volatile phosphors," "Chronos Bloom"). The prose has a lyrical, controlled rhythm that heightens pressure, e.g., "fractured memories" dancing across soil. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and varied syntax. One minor filter-verb stack ("He understood now") in a peak beat slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a 9+ score. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of bioluminescence, botany, and memory science. The ultraviolet revelation feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming a personal grief into a universal mechanism for sensory recall. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure image is singular and indelible.</comment>
