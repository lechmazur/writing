<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her identity as a pruner, with embodied emotion and a credible final choice. The ache in her chest during the ritual is a specific, cost-infusing moment that earns her endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory density to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible in the spectral ache and the final image of leaves "of impossible blue." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The parapet and waterfall are not just backdrop but active constraints and resources. The waterfall's spray kisses the earth where the seed is planted, and the mossy stone ledge is the stage for the entire ritual, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening ritual and the sudden ache of memory, forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (succor for souls) is tested and paid for on the page with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of wonder emerging from weave, not wound, is earned through the specific ritual and final image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior despair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific voice. The prose rhythm modulates with the ritual's intensity. Purposeful elision in the spectral world is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic but generally purposeful, advancing the narrative. Minor risk of ornamental density in phrases like "radiant hush of possibility," but clarity and momentum are maintained, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of pruning as literal magic to weave between worlds is a fresh, specific, and inevitable-feeling concept. The risk of high-lyricism pays off by heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
