<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional moments where emotional specificity verges on poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost on the page. The closure image of the luminous scar-map reconfigures meaning without exposition. Orientation is immediate and pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting and darkroom timer actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual metaphor in peak beats, though it remains character-motivated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a single decisive intensification (the timing ritual) that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible in the sweat on his forehead and the whispered uncensored line, foreclosing a path of silent endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of survival. The cartography of scars motif is fully integrated and reweights prior material without moralizing. Exceptional emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice is coherent. Minor deduction for occasional dense figurative clusters that slightly slow momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, though minor figurative overload appears in some high-pressure sentences (e.g., "grief thinned to transparency"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Rhythm varies naturally and supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of astronomical observation and personal trauma feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of the darkroom timer into a tool for measuring silence is particularly ingenious.</comment>
