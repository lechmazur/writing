<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaito's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices (cupping the lavender, pressing the stone) revealing his hierarchy of values. His motivation to understand persistence is dramatized through tactile interaction with the glass, not summary. A minor deduction for the timeline vision which, while beautiful, briefly feels like a POV knowledge break as he sees the keeper's final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kaito understands the phototropic nature of kindness, reconfiguring his role from seeker to witness. The cost is the weight of this knowledge, felt in the final image of the glass generating light. The timeline vision is the one minor causality break, but it serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The wasteland pressures Kaito's search, the oasis focuses his action, and the lantern glass is the micro-setting that transforms the narrative. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through his potter's consciousness (e.g., "clay he’d shaped weeks ago").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kaito's agency under the Accumulative lens: his choice to trace the glass and later cup the lavender deepens his knowledge and reweights the stake from observation to participation. The cost is legible in the thrum resonating through him and the offered river stone, a tangible forfeiture that alters the possibility of the place.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the central image of phototropic kindness, resisting abstract statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—kindness as a persistent light—that reweights the entire narrative. The final paragraph avoids moralizing, instead crystallizing the concept through the glowing glass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature shaped by Kaito's zen-mindedness and potter's touch. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, from the slow, deep breathing at the start to the sharper, gentler final bow. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually free of artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("phototropic to kindness"). One minor rhythm stumble in the long sentence beginning "He saw flashes," but it serves the accumulative effect. Read-aloud quality is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, zen philosophy, and the phototropic concept is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotional conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
