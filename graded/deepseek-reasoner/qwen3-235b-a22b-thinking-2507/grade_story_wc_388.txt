<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a consistent trait (truth-seeking). Her actions align with her motives, and the final choice to leave the diamond is a credible endurance with felt cost. A minor deduction for the "intuited" realization, which feels slightly less earned than her other deductions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing (CR) that reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost. The ending beat ("the weight of truth heavier than any stone") lands the cost perfectly. The plot is tightly constructed with clear because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a character that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. The wasteland orchard and the stillpoint are not just described but are integral to the plot's causality. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Lena's professional POV. The flawed diamond constrains choice and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly through Lena's investigation, tightening from anomaly to discovery to horrifying revelation. The dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early and tested by the reassembly's difficulty. The cost of the truth is legible and heavy on the page, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the plot's particulars—the contrast between "miracles" and engineered truth, "comfortable lies" and brutal sacrifice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights everything prior. It embraces complexity without moralizing, leaving the cost of the excavation palpable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Lena's profession. The prose has a controlled, purposeful texture. The only minor flaw is a slight convergence into a more omniscient register at the "intuited the full scope" moment, but it quickly recovers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propelled by strong verbs and specific nouns. Rhythm varies naturally with the scene's needs. Information density is high without feeling overwritten. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic investigation and terraforming conspiracy. The concept of the "stillpoint" and the flawed diamond as a key feel organic and ingenious. The story commits fully to its implications, resulting in a powerful and authentic vision.</comment>
