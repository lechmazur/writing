<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with embodied tension ("hand, usually steady as stone, trembled slightly"). Her final choice carries visible cost through the weight transformation, though the "wisely enduring" trait feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear on-page cost ("weight on her shoulders felt lighter, not gone, but transformed"). The single tightening—the thorn's precise application—narrows options decisively, and the final image recharges prior motifs (aurora, thorn, water).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (sanctuary's silence, aurora's light) and charging the final image. The thorn and aurora are tactile and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV ("pearl twilight," "dripping water like a heartbeat"). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (correcting the forgery without exposure) is signaled early and tightens through the thorn's application, a meaningful escalation under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the weight transformation and the risk of Crown's wrath. Protagonist agency drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "forgiving the unfinished" emerges through action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the thorn's purpose and the weight's transformation. Resists moralizing; embraces complexity through "calibrated treason."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("powdered lapis," "pearl twilight"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure ("infinite pressure, less than a moth's wingbeat"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression (backstory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though slightly overwritten in places ("pearl twilight" repeated). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift in "wisely enduring" but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, transforming the forger trope through moral complexity. The thorn and "calibrated treason" are organic and irreplaceable. Synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
