<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is vivid and specific, with his "thoughtfully spirited" narration revealing a coping mechanism rooted in grief. His motivation to create "safe zones for inquiry" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his choice to abandon the furnace. A minor deduction for a moment of telling ("his heart fully thawed") that abstracts a richly embodied emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through the steady *plink* of meltwater until the console's crack forces a decisive change. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias turns toward the village, his purpose "clearer than glass," with the cost of abandoning his tools legible on the page. The drive lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the melting ice shapes his final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is a vividly rendered, purpose-driven setting that pressures the action through its melting ceiling and eventual flooding. Sensory detail is selective and potent, filtered through Elias's perspective. Capped below 9.0 as the environment, while atmospheric, does not quite constrain a choice with the force required for the highest band; the flood is a complication he flees rather than a constraint he navigates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (creating havens for inquiry) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens via the intensifying meltwater, culminating in the console's crack—a meaningful tightening that forces abandonment. The cost of losing his tools and sanctuary is felt, and his agency in choosing to save the orbs charges the final image. A near-flawless execution of pressure for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the potent juxtaposition of melting ice and a thawing heart, avoiding direct statement. The final image of the orbs as "tiny suns" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of renewal, reweighting the prior material of loss and isolation. The grandmother's poetry ("Even stone yields...") is integrated as a earned insight, not a platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through Elias's glassblower sensibility. His internal monologue has a consistent, theatrical rhythm that modulates under pressure. A minor register drift occurs in the climax ("His motivation crystallized"), briefly slipping into a summary tone that slightly dulls the immediacy of the high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. A deduction for minor overwriting in a peak beat: "embodying weighty lightness: gravity tempered by joy" is a self-conscious, explanatory phrase that interrupts the narrative momentum. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is excellent, with varied rhythms and concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glassblower in a melting Arctic station is fresh and organic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "the thawing heart" is deeply integrated into the specific lived reality of the character and setting, avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking in the theatrical narration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
