<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (revolutionary zeal vs. "burnished sorrow") act simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to demonstrate the shard is earned by prior causality and reveals a visible, felt cost in the final paragraph's mourning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands with undeniable cost ("mourning a world she could never rebuild"). The inferred Causal lens holds tightly, with the demonstration acting as a decisive because/therefore linkage that proves the shard's purpose and reconfigures the meaning of her past actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "baroque asteroid" and "visible time-rivers" are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting forces the final demonstration and the storm's temporal chaos is the key pressure mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Elara's decision to demonstrate the shard directly responds to Varek's pressure and the storm's arrival. The cost of her success—the hollow victory and lost future—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of dogma vs. science, reweighting the entire civilization's history through the specific, earned realization that "We destroyed the very wisdom we needed to survive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and masterful rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent, poetically-inflected POV. The elision of the revolution's details is purposeful and paid off by the closure's cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density and propulsion, though a minor register drift occurs in the phrase "poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in an introductory beat. No artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of archaeological dispute, temporal physics, and post-revolutionary guilt feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, devastating conclusion, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
