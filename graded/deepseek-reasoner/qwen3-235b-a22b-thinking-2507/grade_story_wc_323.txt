<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and intensifies, embodied through micro-choices like handling the anchor chain. His balanced curiosity is shown, not told, constraining his teaching method. Kael provides secondary pressure, and the final cost is felt in the reconfiguration of the anchor chain's meaning from relic to key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Aris's goal to validate starlight navigation drives the demo with Kael, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the system hums to life, reweighting the city from tomb to cradle. Cost is legible in the anchor chain's smoothed edges from years of contemplation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The benthic city and anchor chain function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "cold, pitted surface," "bioluminescent light"), integrated into action and reflecting Aris's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expanding navigation beyond local currents) escalates through Kael's skepticism, forcing Aris to demonstrate edge geometry. Agency drives the tightening, and cost is visible in the traded certainty of physical charts for the unseen quantum whispers, foreclosing old options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of balancing old and new knowledge emerges organically through the anchor chain and edge geometry, resisting moralizing. The final image ("drowned light into a compass") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating known and unknown, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward navigation concepts. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Kael's skepticism challenges Aris). Purposeful compression ("edge geometry" as a term) is taught and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language ("water's memory of starlight") serves character and theme. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Closure image is sharp and unburdened by artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic, alien-contact, and navigation tropes through specific details like neutrino patterns and edge geometry. The anchor chain's transformation from relic to key feels inevitable. Risk-taking with scientific concepts heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
