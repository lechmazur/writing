<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's prosopagnosia is a specific, embodied flaw that actively constrains her and drives the plot. Her motivation is clear and rooted in a credible desire for empathy, not just case resolution. The final choice to draw Clara's essence is earned by her prior struggle. A minor deduction for the trait not being more actively limiting in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the portrait awakens dormant empathy, reconfiguring the case's possibilities. The cost is legible in the witness's tears and the line "I forgot how much she mattered." Causality is tight, with the ritual and drawing directly leading to the witness's appearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry is a micro-setting that actively pressures Elena and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her methodical POV ("measured the distance," "noted the mist’s density"). The environment constrains choice and evolves with the emotional arc, lifting its shadows as the case warms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the accumulative lens: her ritual and decisive act of drawing intensify the pressure, culminating in the witness's arrival. The dominant stake (awakening empathy/remembering Clara) is clear and tightens meaningfully. The cost is the emotional weight of her failure and the rekindled grief, felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of concealment vs. revelation emerges organically from the particulars of the mask, the ribbon, and Elena's condition. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the portrait, reweighting the concept of seeing and being seen. Avoids moralizing; the final image carries the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a methodical, perceptive voice. Diction is generally controlled and purposeful, though a slight register drift occurs in the line "lanced the silence," which feels elevated for the established voice. The internal texture remains coherent and supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. One minor flaw: the metaphor "lanced the silence" is slightly mixed (a blade lances, but silence is not a boil). This is a hairline slip that does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist and a cold case is fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and conflict. While strong, it doesn't achieve the highest level of inevitability or risk-taking that would push it into the 9+ band.</comment>
