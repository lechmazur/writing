<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His gentle persistence is shown through action, not label, and the final bell ring feels earned. Minor deduction for some idealization in secondary characters, but no major flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the bell's chime, reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost under the accumulative/textural lens. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity, with the arbor and bell shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV. The terra-cotta arbor and antique bell constrain choices and charge the final image, acting as micro-settings that alter tactics and deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/tradition) is signaled early; escalation is driven by agency through the food runs and bell declaration, narrowing options with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the escalation is subtle rather than sharply causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bell's echo and the living tapestry image, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased through Elias. Lyrical compression is taught and paid off, and diction remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with varied rhythm, zero artifacts or loops. Figurative language serves pressure and closure without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion aligns with scene needs, and the final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of exile resilience tropes through specific details (e.g., "Thyme" donor, bell as heritage object). The quiet climax feels inevitable and bold, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates. No derivative echoes.</comment>
