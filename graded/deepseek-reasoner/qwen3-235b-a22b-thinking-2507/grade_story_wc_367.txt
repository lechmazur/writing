<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile micro-choices (e.g., "fingers trembling on the wick’s housing"). Her internal conflict between doubt and duty is dramatized in scene, and her final choice to realign the beam is earned by prior causality. The cost of failure is viscerally felt through the memory of other keepers' silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (dawn is forged) with a resonant reconfiguration of the premise ("using brokenness to mend"). The hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds: pressure escalates causally from the storm, while the final image accumulates thematic weight. The cost is legible in the "ancient duty lift[ing]" and the "fragile, luminous hope."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional expertise (e.g., "temperature critical for the reflection method"). The environment pressures the climax via the rogue wave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: Elara's adjustments to the wick directly cause the beam's fracture and her subsequent discovery. The cost is unmistakable in the panic of "ancient shadows writhing chaotically" and the tangible relief of the dawn's arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (otherworldly routine) and character action, culminating in the non-literal answer that broken light can amplify. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant synthesis of shadow and illumination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature rooted in Elara's expertise and emotional state. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, though a few phrases ("shadowed elation") risk slight overwriting. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent information density. Minor deduction for a slight figurative pile-up in the climax ("dance of darkness and radiance"), which momentarily risks clarity. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold, and syntax accelerates with the storm's intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of mythic and scientific elements (total internal reflection as magic system) feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and stakes. Bold risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
