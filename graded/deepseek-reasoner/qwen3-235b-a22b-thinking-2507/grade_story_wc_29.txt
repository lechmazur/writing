<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with Aris's cautious hope and professional obsession driving every micro-choice. His final stride with the chart is earned by prior causality, though a slight diagnostic tinge ("felt a spark of ethereal grit") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and held. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: Aris steps into the chaos with proof, reconfiguring the stakes. The cost is legible in the strained power system and the looming administrative threat, making the victory fragile and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The university radio station is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (grounding rods, charts). The astronomical charts are a recurring object that constrains choice and charges the final image when raised as a "banner." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Aris's unorthodox plan directly narrows his options and raises the cost. The dominant stake (truth vs. deception) tightens meaningfully, though the external protest conflict remains a secondary, static pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the parallel between terrestrial and cosmic power plays, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the clean cosmic whisper, reweighting the noise of human conflict without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, technical voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Aris's specialized expertise without obfuscation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and vivid, specific imagery. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "ethereal grit," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic sabotage and academic politics feels fresh and inevitable. The specific method of using subsonic frequencies through bedrock grounding rods is a high-risk, ingenious choice that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the premise.</comment>
