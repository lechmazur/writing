<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the weight in his chest not gone, but transformed"). The final choice to leave the note is earned by prior causality, with visible cost. Minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic self-awareness in the climax ("he finally grasped the physics").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with undeniable cost on the page ("the weight in his chest not gone, but transformed"). The persistent constraint of grief shapes all tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The submarine and library function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's analytical lens. The snow globe is a recurring object that decisively reweights the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the discovery and unraveling of the thread. The cost is legible on the page in the transformed weight in his chest. A single, meaningful deepening perfectly suits this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of letting go through the concrete image of releasing the snow globe. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the note, the thread, and the artifacts, avoiding any moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. The analytical, scientific voice is consistent and apt. Minor deduction for a cluster of filter verbs in the high-pressure beat of reading the note ("he remembered," "he finally grasped").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; prose is concise and vivid. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("true release required understanding the precise point... where holding on ceased to honor"), but it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of deep-sea exploration, grief, and the physics of release feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choice of the snow globe and the note transforms a familiar emotional arc into a singular, memorable perspective. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
