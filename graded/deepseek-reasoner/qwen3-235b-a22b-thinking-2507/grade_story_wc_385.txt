<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaela's motivation is clear, fierce, and rooted in personal loss ("to learn why some people echo while others, like her brother, vanished into silence"). Her "richly perceptive" trait is embodied through specific sensory details (feeling vibrations, the shell warming) and drives micro-choices. The final resolve to sing is a credible, earned stance crystallization. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on lyrical summary in one emotional beat ("reed-blown melancholy").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kaela's crystallized resolve to sing at Dawn Cleft reconfigures the stakes with undeniable pressure, a resonant reconfiguration. The plot advances through a coherent accumulation of sensory details and revelations (the gene, the shell's twin) that deepen the central mystery. A minor causality question arises: the Council's immediate tracking via the "cosmic frequency" feels slightly convenient, a small ellipsis in an otherwise tight, taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus" is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. The sandstone, starlight, and canyon walls are not decorative; they constrain movement, provide cover, and resonate with the story's core concept. The seashell half is a key object-as-setting, its physical properties (warming, humming, jagged seam) directly influencing Kaela's tactics and decisions throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: Renn's revelation about the "resonance gene" and the guarded twin shell fundamentally deepens Kaela's knowledge and raises the cost of her planned action. Her agency is clear in choosing to proceed with "progressive disclosure," a tactic that forecloses the path of safety with a felt cost. The stakes (suppression of truth) are made concrete and visceral through her brother's fate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (suppression of truth vs. its survival) emerges organically from the central conflict and Kaela's specific, personal motive. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through her resolve to sing, an act that is both defiance and a bridge to "the song beneath all things." The "reed-blown melancholy" tone is integrated into the prose's texture, charging the final image without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature, deeply filtered through Kaela's consciousness ("the universe hummed its secret song"). POV is stable and apt. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext and advancing the plot. A minor deduction for occasional syntactic density that, while voice-motivated, creates slight momentum drag in high-pressure beats (e.g., "Reed-blown melancholy thickened the air...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly textured and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting; a cluster of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("reed-blown melancholy," "thin and aching as a flute’s last note," "constellations might betray them") creates a slight density artifact that momentarily obscures clarity. The artifact does not touch the closure beat, but it slightly dulls momentum in the middle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a conspiracy suppressing "echo-singers" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of fantasy and political intrigue. The world feels singular, anchored by specific, lived-in details (the seashell half, the resonance gene). The resolution through "progressive disclosure" is a bold, specific choice that heightens stakes and feels inevitable in hindsight, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
