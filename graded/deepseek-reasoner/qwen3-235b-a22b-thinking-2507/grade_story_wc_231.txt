<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's eccentricity and motivation are deeply embodied through concrete details (talking to gulls, charting clouds) and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation—keeping the lighthouse burning brighter—is earned by the causality of the borrowed memories and carries visible cost in the closing image. Interiority is specific and contradictory, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Silas's understanding reweights the gesture from puzzle to promise, with cost legible in the final image of peace settling into his bones. The accumulative lens holds, building through sensory density and memory flashes that cohere into a decisive shift in meaning. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, lighthouse, and mist are not just atmospheric but actively constrain perception and charge the final image. The Edelweiss object functions as a micro-setting, its high-mountain origin creating a tangible gap that Silas investigates. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency in observing gaps, culminating in the memory surge that decodes the gesture. The stake—honoring the stranger—tightens meaningfully through this deepening of knowledge. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of his isolation into connection, though the pressure is more accumulative than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of isolation, memory, and honor, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of connection. The Edelweiss transforms from artifact to bridge, charging the final image without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and silences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Silas's perception, with a distinct rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose has a textured, lyrical quality that remains legible and purpose-driven. There is no head-hopping or register drift, even under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with vivid, concrete imagery and strong rhythmic variation. Minor density issues appear in phrases like "witnessed isolation" which edges toward label-speak, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper and borrowed memories feels fresh and inevitable, transforming the familiar trope of a washed-ashore stranger through specific, grounded choices. The core concept is executed with high originality and emotional authenticity, avoiding template plots or derivative premises.</comment>
