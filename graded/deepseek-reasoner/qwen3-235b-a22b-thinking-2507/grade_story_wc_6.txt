<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her complex relationship to her father's legacy. The final renunciation of hatred for land-focused compassion is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for slightly telling phrasing ("she refused to let ash define her") where showing dominates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the scar's song reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the tears "not for the father... but for the lagoon." Persistent constraint of past trauma shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (black sand nourishes grafts) and charging the final image (obsidian lagoon mirrors sky). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities. The environment is a active participant in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—the grafting action deepens into emotional realization. Cost is unmistakable in the visible tears and the weight of the vow. One meaningful tightening (from physical act to auditory revelation) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (grafting, black sand, coin) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the scar's song, reweighting prior material. Avoids therapy-speak; wisdom is earned through concrete struggle and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's consciousness. Diction remains within her lexicon; figurative language is voice-motivated and pattern-taught. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in one paragraph ("cold and fine as ground starlight" slightly decorative). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; propulsion is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of arson, legacy, and ecological renewal. Specific grounded choices (volcanic sand, grafting technique) avoid tropiness. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
