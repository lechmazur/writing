<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction (envy/pity for Engines, desire for sacred simplicity) acts in scene. Her final renunciation of grand feats for quiet witnessing is earned by the keystone's restoration, with visible cost in the spire's groan and her discarded pack. Embodied emotion ("hands trembled not from cold but purpose") avoids diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of imagery (frost, mist, luminance) deepens to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands with cost: the spire groans, her pack is discarded, and the final image of "brilliant dimness" reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and garden folly keystone are micro-settings that constrain choice (mist walking requires surrender) and charge the final image (the spire's groan, the lingering glow). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception ("ice fracturing underfoot").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift: the keystone's click home triggers the luminance bloom, reweighting the dominant stake (finding sacred simplicity) with cost (the spire's groan). Protagonist agency drives the escalation via her choice to unstrap and place the keystone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme (sacred in the simple) emerges through concrete particulars (snowflake, cracked teacups) and is resolved non-literally in the final image of "brilliant dimness." The Engines' logic failing to parse the light offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("brilliant dimness of perpetual twilight"). Purposeful compression ("mist walk, the ancient technique shunned") is taught and pays off. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon, even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. One minor figurative density issue: "time bent like the ice fracturing underfoot" slightly muddles sense in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of automated art and ancient magic feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices (the keystone, mist walking). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
