<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("heart hammering against the shell") and micro-choices (shifting weight, planting feet). The final choice feels earned, though the triumph's swiftness slightly undercuts the prior struggle's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (statue uprooted, sprout emerges) with visible cost (shaken fruit, fractured clockwork). The "gap between knowing and understanding" is paid off cleanly. One minor ellipsis in the statue's turn from hesitation to liberation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (sky-bridge vantage, copper leaves). The locust shell and statues function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the sky-bridge itself is underutilized as a tactical element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (playing deeper, commanding the note). The cost is legible (statue’s destruction, orchard’s transformation). A slight abruptness in the statue’s final capitulation slightly softens the pressure gradient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (reawakening beauty through resonance, not force) emerges organically from the climactic uprooting and the sprout’s emergence. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the statue’s hesitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure. Minor register drift in phrases like "tarnished wonder hung heavy" feels slightly decorative but does not break coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "resonantly soft" appears three times, risking synonym churn). The closure image remains clear and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of music, mechanics, and magic feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "signaling through heart rhythms" is ingeniously specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off at closure.</comment>
