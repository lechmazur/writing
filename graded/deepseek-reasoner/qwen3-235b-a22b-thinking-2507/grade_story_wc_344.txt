<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and profound, her micro-choices under pressure are specific and embodied, and her final renunciation of force for communion is earned. A slight deduction for the "driftwood nostalgia" feeling slightly more told than fully dramatized in its contradiction, though it effectively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara learns time's song; cost is legible in the "quiet pride" and the library's exhale. The prophecy method is taught and pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library and Hall of Mirrors are not just vivid backdrops but essential constraints that shape Elara's every choice and charge the final image. The environment is fully integrated into action and perception, with impeccable sensory detail and spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the intensifying eclipse and disorienting reflections, culminating in a decisive cadence shift at totality. Elara's agency drives the resolution, and the cost of her altered understanding is felt. A minor deduction for the prophecy's introduction feeling slightly convenient, though it is quickly integrated into her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: repair as communion, not conquest. The final image of synchronized reflections offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior struggle. The integration of "driftwood nostalgia" avoids sentimentality, deepening the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical density is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, effectively conveying Elara's professional focus and emotional state. No head-hopping or register drift, even under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly textured, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional risk of overwriting (e.g., "lunar-eclipse locksmith" feels slightly ornate), and a single paraphrase loop ("the rhythm of repair" / "learned its song"), though it serves thematic closure and does not obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a celestial locksmith mending time in a frozen library is a fresh, specific synthesis. The execution commits fully to its premise, transforming familiar tropes (prophecy, chosen one) through grounded, character-driven choices and a non-obvious resolution.</comment>
