<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("gentle radical"), with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His final choice to confront Varr is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the faltering of Varr's expression. The hierarchy of values—truth over expediency—is revealed through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds strongly. The retrocognitive vision provides a because/therefore linkage that narrows options and forces the final confrontation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in Varr's faltering and the crews lowering tools, reconfiguring the city's options for healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The plaza and mosaic stepping stone are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The tessera functions as a key, and the shattered sky mirrors the fractured truth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's urgent perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the vision forces a new tactical goal (find the stepping stone), leading to the confrontation. The dominant stake (historical truth vs. official narrative) tightens meaningfully, and the cost is legible in the halted demolition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the revelation of "aberrant mercy," resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the completed script and the halted work, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Complexity is embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. The elision of the retrocognitive event is taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with clear status dynamics between Kael and Varr.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences creates a minor, consistent cadence in high-pressure beats ("Kael gasped, back in the cold plaza..."). No loops or artifacts obscure closure; information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, historical revisionism, and a "gentle radical" protagonist feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "aberrant mercy" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the vision and the final revealed script, avoiding cliché.</comment>
