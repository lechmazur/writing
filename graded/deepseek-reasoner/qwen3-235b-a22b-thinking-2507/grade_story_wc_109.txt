<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's obsession is a clear, consistent driver that intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes, unconventional choice to map silence. Her internal conflict between past and present is dramatized through embodied perception (e.g., fingers remembering pebbles). The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in her stained fingers and the warm booklet, a credible renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence is reweighted from void to ground, with cost legible in the final image of the "warm" booklet and her smile. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. The pattern of accumulating silences pays off decisively at the climax without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ridge fort and gold leaf booklet are not just vivid but essential, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful (e.g., "salt spray stinging the arrow slits"), filtered through Elara's POV to mirror internal states without overt symbolism. The booklet's physical state actively shapes her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, profound cadence shift—the stretched lull and returning roar—that reweights the dominant stake of mapping the night. Protagonist agency drives this intensification; her act of listening and marking is an active choice that narrows options, with cost visible in the "ink and salt" stained fingers and the pooling wax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence as substance emerges organically from concrete events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material ("silence... was the ground beneath your feet"). Subtext operates powerfully in implication and image, avoiding moralizing. The final realization feels earned through specific struggle, not summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose's lyrical, compressed texture is voice-motivated, pattern-taught, and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythm and information density, with sentences advancing multiple jobs (e.g., "ambered hush" thick with meaning). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor deduction (-0.1) for a marginally dense metaphor ("wax pooling like frozen tears") in a high-pressure beat, though it remains coherent and does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept of mapping silence is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyrical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The perspective is singular and memorable, transforming the familiar "prophecy" trope through specific, grounded choices in character and method.</comment>
