<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his sacred duty, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., taking the diamond, dancing) revealing his values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though some backstory summary exists but is anchored in present action. The final endurance—carrying the sonic imprint—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (diamond's destruction).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Kael retains the sonic texture despite loss. Closure lands on-page with cost (diamond's death, emptiness). Orientation is immediate; the canyon and stake are anchored within the first paragraph. Persistent constraint (diamond's flaw) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the canyon and bone towers constrain choice (e.g., tunnel multiplies sound, porous texture informs action) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "porous texture," "dim, dusty light"), filtered through Kael's expertise. The environment evolves causally with the climax (echoes bending, diamond cracking).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Kael's dance and focus intensify sensory density, narrowing options (diamond's use forecloses other paths). Cost is legible (diamond's destruction, profound emptiness). One meaningful tightening suffices—the flaw's flare reweights stakes with visible price. No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (preservation through transformation) emerges organically from events (dance, diamond's failure) and the final image—sonic imprint lingering—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to language death. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., starlings as conduits, flaw as curse). No moralizing; complexity embraces cost and partial victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward sensory translation (e.g., "textures of their world into sound"). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (lyrical in buildup, concise in climax). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., shaman's backstory) is purposeful and paid off in the diamond's curse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs (e.g., "erupted," "funneled"). Figurative language ("skeletal hand," "liquid thought") is pattern-taught and supports tone. Minor scaffold in backsummary ("dedicated his life") but no loops or artifacts obscuring closure. Rhythm accelerates appropriately.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory translation, cursed object, and avian patterning feels inevitable. Specificity (copper-veined skin, flawed diamond) avoids tropes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: plot and emotion are inseparable from this world's logic.</comment>
