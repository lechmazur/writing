<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion ("vibrations flowed through her body") and a clear motivation that intensifies through micro-choices like experimenting with different records. Her final renunciation of despair for a "mirrored hush" is earned by prior causality. The drum maker applies subtle secondary pressure, though his sudden crafting shift feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully with a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the "symphony of silence" reweights music and disability with undeniable cost. The causal lens holds tightly through Eleanor's experiments. The drum maker's late involvement slightly softens causality, but the protagonist's agency drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables choices—its stone floor transmits vibrations, and the discarded phonograph needle becomes a crucial tool. Sensory details are purposefully tactile and auditory-adjacent ("filament of hush"), filtered through Eleanor's deafness. The setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency under the causal lens: her experimentation with backward recordings narrows options and deepens stakes. The cost is legible when vibrations "reawaken memories" and later "enthrall" students. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the needle's power, though the drum maker's adaptation happens off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the core concept of "filament of hush"—a non-literal answer to emotional numbness that reweights silence as potent expression. Subtext operates in gestures like her "silent dance," and the ending offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. The integration of disability and artistry is particularly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on vibration and tactile sensation. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though one paragraph ("Each day, Eleanor returned...") has slightly template cadence. Elision (e.g., the accident) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("filament of hush"). Minor scaffold appears in the "Each day" paragraph with repetitive sentence openings. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, backward music, and vibrational expression is highly original and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept transforms silence from absence to medium, with specific risk-taking in the tactile portrayal of sound. The premise is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
