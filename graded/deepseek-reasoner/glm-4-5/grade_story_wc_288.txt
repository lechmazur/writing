<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion in lines like "brittle awakenings left her raw and exposed." Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though the "brittle awakenings" concept borders on abstract summary at times.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final mosaic image. The hum of the stone circle provides a coherent pattern that deepens and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal library and atomically reflective surfaces are vividly specific and constrain choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early; pressure escalates through internal accumulation under the textural lens. A single meaningful deepening occurs via the stone circle's hum, forcing a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to isolation vs. connection without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Minor register drift in "brittle awakenings" slightly tempers the score, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, though a template cadence emerges in lists like "with the library's tides, with her past lives..." Information density is high, and closure is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction, reincarnation, and sentient library feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
