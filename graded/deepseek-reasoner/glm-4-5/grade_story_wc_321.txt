<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Liam's motivation is deeply rooted in his fractured existence across timelines, compelling high-stakes choices. His resilient positivity under pressure is embodied through specific actions like tracing patterns on the console. The final unification feels earned by his prior causality, with visible cost in his permanent transient state. Minor deduction for slightly expository backstory block, but it anchors present action effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (timelines merging) with felt cost in Liam's ephemeral wholeness. Orientation is immediate; the spectral grotto's rules are taught through action. The radio dialogue slightly explains but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and transforming ferry constrain choices and charge the final image with crystal stalactites and liquid starlight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Liam's expertise. The hourglass and console patterns function as micro-settings that directly shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Liam's agency under causal lens, narrowing options to the final merge. Cost is legible in his permanent transience. Stakes are personal and universal, interwoven through his childhood accident. One meaningful tightening (the convergence sequence) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness emerges through the hourglass imagery and merged sands without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the neural pathway patterns. Subtext operates in the grotto's silence and the passengers' knowing smiles. Slight exposition in radio exchange caps the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("water that shimmered like liquid starlight"). Compression is purposeful and taught. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the radio exchange advances plot. Lyrical prose remains character-bound and consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor figurative overload in phrases like "lover returning from long absence" slightly strains coherence but doesn't obscure closure. Rhythm varies effectively; no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time travel and ferry mythology feels inevitable. The hourglass as a unification symbol is fresh and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in nonlinear time pays off with coherence. Specificity in chronal energy and three moons anchors the concept.</comment>
