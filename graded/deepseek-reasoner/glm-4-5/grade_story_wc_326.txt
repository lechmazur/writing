<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("My trembling hand, which exists somewhere between digital projection and physical reality"). The final acceptance of a digital existence feels earned by the ritual and its revelations, though the digital nature of the consciousness could impose more tangible constraints on its perception and choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The cost of the protagonist's transformed existence is legible in the final image of making coffee for the living, a poignant act of connection that underscores their separation. The lens is slightly ambiguous in the first half, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory and relentless snow are vividly rendered and actively pressure the protagonist's isolation. The porcelain shard and inkwell function as a micro-setting that constrains the ritual action, and the final image of the observatory "nestled in silence" charges the closure with tangible atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the intensifying ritual and the density of revealed meaning. The dominant stake (understanding/peace) is deepened by the protagonist's agency in performing the ink ritual, which leads to a reweighting of their existence with a clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific particulars of the ritual and the protagonist's condition. The final realization that "failure isn't the end but a transformation" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, earned entirely through the dramatized action and its consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical quality suited to a digital consciousness observing the physical world ("blurring the boundaries between the iridescent walls and the white world outside"). The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively with the introspective pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of potential register drift ("digital ghost existence") is brief and arguably voice-motivated, causing no material harm to clarity or momentum. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital ghost, a death certificate error, and an ink-based divination ritual is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through a singular, authentic artistic stance that avoids cliché or abstraction.</comment>
