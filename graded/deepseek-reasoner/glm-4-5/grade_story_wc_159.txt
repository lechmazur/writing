<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eleth's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in their role, with embodied emotion ("heart clenched with foxglove regret") and micro-choices (cradling the tube, selecting the cylinder) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to restore the chime is a credible endurance, earned by their established dedication. A slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("foxglove regret" feels slightly articulated, though it is quickly embodied).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through the discovery of the crack and the deliberate restoration process, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the chimes sound again. The cost of continual loss is felt in the final image of names preserved "for perhaps another day." Orientation is immediate and purposeful, and the lens holds firmly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal library and preservation tools are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining Eleth's choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Eleth's professional expertise (e.g., "light summoned by the echo"). The setting is the story's crucible, making its integration flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</comment><grade>The dominant stake (preserving forgotten sounds) is signaled immediately and escalates through the discovery of the crack, a meaningful tightening that narrows options to a single, costly solution. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is driven by Eleth's agency and the cost is legible in the fragile, temporary nature of the victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of preserving extinct feelings, resisting moralizing through the poignant, non-literal final image of names being remembered only to eventually fade. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question of memory's value without stating it, charged by the specific cost of "foxglove regret."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature ("tears that felt like tiny glass orchids"). Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the prose rhythm modulates beautifully with the emotional pressure of the restoration scene. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and minimal scaffolding. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "foxglove regret" risks feeling like a diagnostic label, though it is quickly embodied. This slight strain in a peak beat prevents a higher score, but clarity and momentum are never sacrificed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of a museum for extinct feelings is brilliantly original and fully committed to, synthesized through specific, lived detail in Eleth's work. The combination of setting, concept, and emotional stakes feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
