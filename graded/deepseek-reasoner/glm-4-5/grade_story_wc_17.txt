<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her exploration and final commitment. Her "sensitively perceptive" trait is shown through concrete actions like tracing vibrations and sifting pages. The final choice to continue Thorne's work is an earned renunciation with a visible cost of inherited responsibility. However, the interiority lacks significant contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the final realization that walls hold "accumulated consciousness" reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with discoveries layering to a cadence shift. The transition from the passage to the lab is the single allowed shard and is handled cleanly. A minor deduction for the slightly convenient discovery of the negative, though its payoff is fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and the chamber are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional priorities. The fireplace, diaries, and film negative all function as micro-settings that shape the narrative's outcome decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from mapping to discovery to a transformative realization. The dominant stake of uncovering history tightens meaningfully with each find. The cost of the "legacy's burden" is legible on the page in her renewed commitment, though the pressure could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of architectural memory emerges organically from the particulars of echo mapping and the discovered artifacts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what walls dream about" without moralizing. The conceptual repricing carries significant cost, and the theme is inextricable from Elara's internal arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, perceptive texture. The narrative voice effectively filters the world through Elara's professional expertise. A minor deduction for occasional phrases that lean toward telling her traits ("sensitively perceptive") rather than fully embodying them, but the overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, concise, and possesses a varied, purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles are present. The final paragraph lands with potent resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of an echo cartographer mapping architectural memories is highly original and specific. The synthesis of sonic and visual history feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with integrity, resulting in a fresh, memorable perspective.</comment>
