<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply embodied, with her hand moving instinctively to the jade cicada and her perception filtered through her expertise. Her internal conflict between funding anxiety and intellectual curiosity is shown simultaneously. The final choice to reframe her research is earned by her prior tangential approach and the cicada's symbolic weight. A minor deduction for Professor Aris, who applies pressure but remains a slightly functional secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, redefining transition periods as substantive moments. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterns (pools, cicada, stars) to a cadence shift. Cost is legible in her transformed perspective, which forecloses a path of direct inquiry. A slight -0.3 deduction for mild lens ambiguity in the middle beats before the pattern fully crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pools are not just backdrop; they actively constrain Maya's perception and catalyze her epiphany. The jade cicada, a micro-setting on her body, charges the final image with ancestral meaning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting her professional gaze. The environment is fully integrated into the thematic and character-driven action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a density increase of reflective patterns, culminating in a decisive cadence shift. The dominant stake of her research's future is reweighted by her realization, forcing a tactical trade-off. The cost is the foreclosure of a direct, well-funded approach, made legible through her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of tidal pools, the cicada, and the paused conversation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about the substance of transitions. Subtext operates powerfully in the cicada's pulsing and the star-reflecting pools. The final conceptual repricing avoids moralizing, arising from concrete particulars of Maya's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice possesses a distinct, observant texture that modulates under pressure without losing coherence. The prose rhythm effectively mirrors the accumulative, reflective nature of her realization. A minor -0.3 deduction for a moment of slight opacity in the peak beat ("the texture of time was woven from uncertainties...") which briefly leans abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with high information density. However, a minor text artifact occurs with the repetitive use of "tangential approach" (used three times), which creates a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a tidal-pool chronicler, a jade cicada heirloom, and the conceptual goal of discovering time's texture is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in character and world avoid tropiness. The quiet, intellectual risk-taking heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the accumulative design.</comment>
