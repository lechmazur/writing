<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle's characterization is strong, with a clear, escalating motivation from obsession to violent determination. Her final choice to guide, not prevent, the night is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic label-speak ("mildly obsessed," "violently determined") in peak beats, though the embodied cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the endless night is reweighted from a threat to a canvas. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through density of imagery and a final cadence shift. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the map and the "held breath."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The storm-tossed fort, the tower chamber, and the gold leaf booklet are not just backdrop but active participants in the drama. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's thematic goals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure cohering and tightening through the intensifying darkness and her deepening comprehension. The dominant stake (survival through understanding) is clear, and the cost of her renunciation (accepting the night) is felt. A single, powerful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges flawlessly from the concrete particulars of the oracle's task. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to confront darkness, reweighting all prior material without a hint of moralizing. The integration of concept (silence, darkness) with theme is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature perfectly matched to the oracle's role. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exemplary. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally to support the scene's needs. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "profound silence," "ambered hush," "marbled hush") in adjacent lines, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar oracle tropes into a fresh, specific, and inevitable whole through its unique focus on silence and mapping darkness. The core concept is original and fully committed to, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
