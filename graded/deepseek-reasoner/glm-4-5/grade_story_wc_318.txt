<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the pull cord handle... slick in his palm"), and the motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to end the symphony is a credible endurance with visible cost. The single note of a flaw is the slight repetition of the "mournfully eager" descriptor, which edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist's stance is crystallized by the ghostly giggle, reconfiguring his relationship to absence with a clear, felt cost ("the mournfully eager ache not gone, but momentarily soothed"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through sensory and emotional density toward this final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is indispensable, actively constraining the protagonist's choice and charging the final image by amplifying and transforming the sound. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, with the setting itself functioning as the primary instrument of the protagonist's ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, modulating the blower's sound to intensify his attempt to communicate. The cost is legible in his frozen posture and the story's final resignation. A single meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length, though the pressure is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of grief and memory emerges organically from the specific, bizarre ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with loss, reweighting absence as a "sanctuary for memory" without moralizing or tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The prose is characterized by a consistent, voice-motivated use of elongated, lyrical sentences that mirror the protracted nature of grief and the echoing sound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing action, character, and atmosphere. There is a very slight tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "mournfully eager" used multiple times) which prevents a perfect score, but no major artifacts obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of using a leaf blower to create a symphony of grief is strikingly original and fully committed to. The combination of mundane and profound elements feels organic and inevitable, synthesizing a fresh, non-obvious angle on mourning through immense specificity and authentic vision.</comment>
