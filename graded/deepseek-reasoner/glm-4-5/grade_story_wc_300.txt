<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the pearl's warmth feeling like "liquid sunlight." The inspector's motivation crystallizes believably from professional duty to transcendent purpose through on-page micro-choices. The final renunciation of her old role is earned by the causal sequence of discovery and absorption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with sensory density and pattern breaks (concrete to crystal) escalating toward the resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the invisible crown's weight and her changed perception of surface-world shadows. The passage discovery acts as the inciting incident that narrows her options toward a single path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves actively constrain choice through their resonant silence and light-refracting properties, charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (e.g., "pulsed with an ethereal blue light") and filtered through professional bias. The bunker's concrete corridors effectively contrast with the organic cave system to mirror her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from procedural inspection to existential purpose through the accumulator lens. The pearl's absorption of hopes and the seashell's confessions deepen the dominant stake of human connection. Protagonist agency drives the climax—her decision to crown herself forecloses her old identity with visible cost (changed perception of people's "abandoned hopes").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of concrete (bunker walls) into emotional barriers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to disconnection through the crown's "living light." Subtext operates powerfully in the seashell's etched confessions and the pearl's absorption mechanic, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable and deeply filtered through the inspector's professional perception. Voice has distinct texture with controlled rhythmic variation ("The resonant hush of the caverns swallowed..."). Purposeful compression in the climax ("heartbeat of a hesitation") serves emotional weight without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density and rhythmic control, particularly in the crown transformation sequence. Minor artifact: "liquid sunlight" slightly strains the established tactile lexicon. No loops or scaffolding issues; sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately during the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mythic elements feels inevitable in hindsight. The cultivated pearl as hope-absorber and the seashell as confessional archive are highly specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the symbolic crown transformation pays off through emotional honesty rather than gimmickry.</comment>
