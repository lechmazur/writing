<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is deeply rooted in loss and purpose, embodied through specific actions like tracing the locket. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to walk forward is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "haunted euphoria" and "increasingly blurred vision."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's "joy and sorrow entwined." Orientation is immediate, with who, where, and when anchored by the second sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty constrains choice as his laboratory and church, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the archivist's professional and personal priorities. The setting evolves with the time transition from twilight to night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the immutable deadline of digitization, a coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost is felt in the "strange haunted euphoria." A single meaningful tightening is sufficient, though the external pressure remains static rather than actively adapting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between preservation and progress, resisting tidy resolution. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory's weight. The "regenerated covenant" is a powerful, integrated concept that avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the archivist's methodical, naturalist observations. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the reflective passages anchored by the locket.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few near-synonyms ("strange haunted euphoria"). These do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a technical preservation process with profound emotional stakes feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on obsolescence and memory. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
