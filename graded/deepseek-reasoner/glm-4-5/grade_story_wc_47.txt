<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("fingers absently traced the amber pendant") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to leave the pendant is earned by prior causality with visible cost, though minor diagnostic language ("protected vulnerability") appears in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) closure. The final image of the pendant enveloped in moss carries undeniable conceptual cost that reweights prior material. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("honeyed hush," "glass under her feet creaking softly"), with the data center environment actively shaping the protagonist's actions and ultimate offering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the spiral pattern serving as a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible in the final relinquishment of the pendant, though pressure remains somewhat internalized rather than externally forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and events rather than direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of healing through integration, with the moss-transformed pendant serving as perfect thematic payoff without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent POV and controlled rhythmic variation. The voice maintains its lyrical quality under pressure while avoiding head-hopping or register drift. Some minor filter verbs ("she felt") appear but don't diminish immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and varied sentence structure with strong read-aloud rhythm. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("honeyed hush deepened, wrapping around her like a balm") slightly affects clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No significant loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of technological decay and personal healing feels inevitable in hindsight. The abandoned data center setting transforms familiar redemption tropes through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
