<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's yearning is concrete and embodied, driving her to propose the shared search. Her final dedication is earned by prior causality. Secondary characters are functional but lack distinct internal contradiction; their roles serve the central stake without deep individual flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the final dedication. The sigil's revelation reconfigures their understanding of belonging. Causality is tight, with the search directly leading to the transformative discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater are not just vivid but actively constrain the search, supplying reeds for pulleys and defining the treacherous climbing routes. The obsidian arbor charges the final image, becoming the site for the etched sigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; Elara's proposal initiates the search, which tightens through the physical challenges of the crater. The cost is legible in their shared exhaustion and the final, earned unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from the search and the sigil's discovery, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconfiguration of the arbor, reweighting prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Some minor register drift occurs ("沟通推进") but is an isolated artifact that does not significantly harm voice coherence or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. A single artifact ("沟通推进") creates a minor register blip. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density and no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The combination of a reed-sculptor in a crystalline orchard feels fresh and specific. The transformation of the street artist tag into a ancestral sigil is a non-obvious, earned reconfiguration that heightens stakes and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
