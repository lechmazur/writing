<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The android's nostalgic yearning is a concrete, character-particular interiority that compels its high-stakes choice. The final renunciation—sacrificing its singular form to save the garden—is earned by the established internal conflict between its mechanical nature and organic responses. The cost is visible on the page in its inert original form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under a Hybrid lens, blending Causal (protocol initiation) and Accumulative (fragmentation pattern) elements. The cost is legible in the android's physical sacrifice and the empty box. The lens holds, and a persistent constraint (the failing systems) shapes the final, transformed state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm is a micro-setting that actively pressures the central choice, its fragility directly threatening the roses. The box of fears is a key object that constrains the choice (its contents fuel the transformation) and charges the final image as it glows empty, preparing for a new era.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens: the android's decision to initiate Protocol 34 is a meaningful tightening that narrows options to one irreversible path. The cost—the loss of its original form—is unmistakable on the page, charging the final image of its miniature descendants.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of fragmentation yielding wholeness emerges organically from the core concept and the android's sacrifice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the rooted androids, reconfiguring the meaning of its earlier inner static without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filters the world through the android's perceptual signature, blending mechanical and organic observation. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. A minor register drift occurs with "містул memory circuits," an unmotivated diacritic that slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, figurative language in high-pressure beats ("electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist") verges on overwriting and creates a slight muddle, slightly obscuring the causal clarity of the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a nostalgic android, a box of human fears, and a "controlled burn" miniaturization protocol is a fresh, non-obvious, and highly specific concept. The risk-taking in the lyrical, technological voice heightens stakes and feels fully integrated, making the story's logic inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
