<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Martin's guilt and internal conflict are concrete and embodied, driving his final choice to abandon his profession. His micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the watch hand and sifting through carvings, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by the causal revelation of his grandfather's acceptance, with a visible cost in his tears. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "tempered regret" realization, which borders on diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (abandoning his business) rooted in a resonant reconfiguration (the grandfather's carving reweights his entire past). The causal lens holds tightly: his actions are linked by therefore logic, culminating in the discovery that forces a new path. The cost is legible on the page in his tears and the final image of placing the objects together. The persistent constraint of his guilt and the watch hand shape his tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are purposefully selective, filtered through Martin's POV to reflect his emotional state. The watch hand and driftwood carvings function as micro-settings that crucially constrain his choices and charge the final image. Sensory details like the "cool metal" and "sieved hush" are vivid and integrated into action. The environment subtly mirrors his internal journey from cold deception to a lighter, reconciled state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (personal absolution vs. professional deception) is signaled early and escalates through a single, meaningful tightening: the discovery of the non-manufactured carving. This deepens his knowledge and narrows his options, forcing a renunciation driven by his own agency. The cost is felt in the visceral reaction to the carving and his tears. The escalation is coherent and causal, foreclosing his old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of inherited truth versus manufactured legacy emerges organically from the particulars of the watch hand and carvings. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconciled objects, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the grandfather's silent acceptance via the carving. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned through Martin's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sieved hush." The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, maintaining a consistent, lyrical rhythm. The elision of his grandfather's backstory is purposeful and paid off in the closure. There is no head-hopping, and the prose remains firmly character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "sieved hush" envelopes him and filters the world). A minor deduction for the triple use of "sieved hush," which, while poetic, creates a slight pattern artifact that dulls the final reprise. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a black market genealogist and a shore of driftwood carvings feels fresh and organic. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on memory and legacy, transformed through specific, grounded details. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. It avoids template plots, though the emotional arc of guilt and redemption is familiar, executed here with high specificity.</comment>
