<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sensory map maker's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. Embodied emotion is strong ("fingers trembled," "shard's heat intensified"), and micro-choices under pressure are present. However, the final endurance feels slightly more told than fully dramatized on the page, holding it back from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred from the pattern of cyclical transitions. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost ("determination burned brighter"). A causality break occurs in the transitions between worlds, which feel more associative than causally linked ("cyclically and spontaneous"), weakening the because/therefore linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is a vivid, purpose-driven setting filtered through the POV's perception. The green glass shard, a micro-setting object, powerfully charges the final image and constrains choice by preventing contact with the red shard. Sensory detail is selective and masterfully woven into the narrative's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift and density increase in the dream-state sequence. The dominant stake (discovering a withheld truth) is clear, and the cost of the shard's spent power is legible on the page, reweighting the character's options for the next attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of forgotten histories and fragmented identity. The final image of the dim shard and burning determination offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of truth's weight. It embraces complexity without moralizing, though the thematic echo of "withheld truth" is slightly prompt-like.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, controlled texture with a strong perceptual signature. The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "Cyclically and spontaneous") is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift disrupts the singular perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive with excellent rhythmic control. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "cyclically and spontaneous" is slightly awkward and feels like a thesaurus-driven synonym pair, creating a small stumble in an otherwise polished line-level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of weaving between worlds is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis executed with high conceptual integrity. The combination of a sensory map maker and a reality-warping shard feels organic and singular. The story fully commits to its premise, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
