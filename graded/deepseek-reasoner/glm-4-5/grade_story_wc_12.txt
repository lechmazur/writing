<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Father Michael's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique discovery and unorthodox methods. His competence and specific tactics under pressure are well-demonstrated, though his internal contradiction or emotional degradation under stress is less explored, keeping him slightly competent-focused for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and holds: his actions directly cause the entity's dissolution. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with cost legible in Sarah's gasp and the faded symbols. The plot is tightly structured with no causality breaks, and the orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor and indigo palette are micro-settings that actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the priest's professional focus, creating a vivid, integrated atmosphere that pressures the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through layered chants and painted symbols, narrowing the entity's options. The cost is felt in Sarah's writhing and the final dissolution. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length, executed with coherent pressure under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of technology and faith, with silence and void as resonant motifs. The final image offers a non-literal answer, though the concluding reflection ("profound truths require... silence") slightly moralizes, creating a small deductive nudge for thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on sacred sound and dimensional mechanics. The voice is confident and specific, though the entity's dialogue is brief and functional rather than deeply subtextual. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor issues include a slight register drift in phrases like "sonic architecture" and "unraveled stillness," which feel academic for peak pressure, and a paraphrase loop near the end ("profound truths require not volume but the space created by silence").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of modern technology (loop pedal) with ancient exorcism rites is highly original and feels inevitable. The concept is committed to fully, with specific, grounded choices in the use of color and sound that transform familiar tropes into a fresh, authentic vision.</comment>
