<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Guardian's dimensional homesickness and practice of interiorizing exteriors create a compelling, embodied motivation that drives the climax. The final transformation feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in their translucent form shift. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing in peak emotional beats ("foggy lucidity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory density increases toward Charged Poise closure. Pendant's activation provides coherent escalation, with dimensional boundaries dissolving in a legible cost image ("translucent at the edges"). Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden functions as both setting and character—constraining choices through frozen roses and mist while charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("crystalline petals shifting to indigo"). The cherub's weathered face and light currents create tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pendant's warming provides clear escalation under Accumulative lens, forcing active attention rather than passive waiting. Guardian's decision to draw energy inward (not control) demonstrates agency that narrows options. Cost is visible in form dissolution and garden transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically through guardian's practice and final transformation. No moralizing; the ending offers resonant non-literal wisdom ("home was not a place but a state of consciousness"). Subtext operates through light imagery and dimensional superimpositions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent lyrical density. POV remains stable with purposeful compression ("foggy lucidity"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("dimensional homesickness" slightly academic), but overall voice supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. One minor figurative strain ("oceans of liquid starlight" feels slightly decorative). No loops or scaffolding; closure image lands with clarity despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of library guardian, dimensional boundaries, and metaphysical themes. The concept of interiorizing exteriors feels fresh and irreplaceable. Risk-taking with lyrical abstraction pays off through coherent pattern and closure.</comment>
