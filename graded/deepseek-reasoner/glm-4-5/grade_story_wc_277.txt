<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("devotedly observant eyes"), with her internal conflict dramatized through the proof-by-contradiction method. Her final choice to intervene is earned by the investigation's causality. A minor deduction for "solemn playfulness" remaining a told trait rather than fully embodied in her on-page actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive change (calling the journalist with uncovered truth) with felt cost of time and emotional investment. Orientation is immediate; the final cost is legible in the dawn imagery and her resolved stance. The single tightening from investigation to revelation is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is not just vivid but actively constrains choice through its isolating nature, forcing focus. The rosewood pen nib is a micro-setting object that charges the final image as a symbol of legacy. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eleanor's professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency using the proof-by-contradiction method, narrowing options logically. The dominant stake (uncovering truth) tightens meaningfully through her investigation. Cost is visible in the passing hours and her mental exertion, charging the final dawn image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth-seeking through contradiction emerges organically from the investigation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("showing people what they've refused to see"). Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic statement in the final line, though it remains character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical signature. The prose effectively uses free indirect style. Minor rhythmic repetition in phrases like "echoing observatory" and "orbits of regret" prevents a higher score, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good information density. However, there is some repetitive phrasing ("echoing observatory" appears 3 times, "orbits of regret" 3 times) that creates a slight template cadence. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but the repetition prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of investigative procedural and emotional legacy feels fresh and organic. The proof-by-contradiction method is a specific, non-obvious approach to mystery solving. The synthesis of character motive and method feels inevitable in hindsight, though not exceptionally rare.</comment>
