<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poet's insomnia and creative drive are a consistent, embodied core, with micro-choices like tracing the postcard and crafting lullabies revealing a clear hierarchy of values. However, the character's internal contradiction is more stated ("curse and gift") than dramatized through simultaneous, conflicting impulses in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly, building pattern density through the lullabies and blossoms to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the poet's death and enduring legacy, and the persistent constraint of insomnia shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures and enables the poet's choices, constraining their world while its walls become the canvas for their transformation. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through the poet's perception, with the bioluminescent blossoms charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the poet's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the act of creating lullabies decisively deepening the stakes and triggering the blossom armistice. The cost is felt in the poet's perpetual wakefulness and ultimate sacrifice, ensuring others can dream.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of transforming pain into beauty, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure: the poet finds purpose not in their own peace but in gifting it to others. The integration is specific and avoids moralizing, with the final image reweighting the centuries of longing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lyrical, third-person POV possesses a distinct and consistent perceptual signature, with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the story's emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting (e.g., "reef-shadow joy" risks abstraction). However, the density serves the accumulative mode and never obscures causality or the closure image. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "blossom armistice" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic and organic elements that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, singular vision of pain transformed into a physical, protective garden through art is executed with high conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking.</comment>
