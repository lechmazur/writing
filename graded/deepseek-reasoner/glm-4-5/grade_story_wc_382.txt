<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and intensifies believably; her micro-choices (e.g., reaching for the seal) reveal her values. Mr. Abernathy's interiority is shown through his emotional revelation about their shared lineage, though his initial "mysterious familiarity" feels slightly more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Clara gains fluency and a new understanding of her heritage. The accumulative lens holds, with knowledge deepening through weekly sessions. The cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the "beginnings of fluency."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is a vital, constraining force. The rooftop garden during the meteor shower is not decorative; it provides the specific light needed for the seal's revelation and charges the final, decisive conversation. The cluttered study and historic district are filtered through Clara's specific, goal-oriented perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening: the rooftop revelation. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a profound, costly understanding of inherited duty and shared bloodline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited memory and unspoken history emerges organically from the particulars of the seal, the buildings, and the bloodline reveal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of buildings as "old friends," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Clara's specific perceptual signature ("stones settled, timbers creaked"). The dialogue between Clara and Mr. Abernathy is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext, especially during the rooftop "interrogation."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential thesaurus-churn ("ephemeral as forgotten words") slightly disrupts the voice's otherwise consistent texture, but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of a linguistic code embedded in architecture is fresh and specific. It is fully committed to and transformed through the grounded choices of the bloodline reveal and the antique seal as a key, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
