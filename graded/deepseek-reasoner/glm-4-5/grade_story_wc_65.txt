<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her "groundedly imaginative" nature is shown through the blend of data and intuition, though the line "her groundedly imaginative approach" tells a trait that is otherwise well-demonstrated. A minor deduction for this summary moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the completed map reconfigures the community's future options. The cost of limited time is legible in the line "Their time to transform... was limited." Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and enable Elara's choice, charging the final image. The kingfisher feather quill is a micro-setting object that evolves in use. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency through her predictive modeling, tightening the tactical need for the map. The cost of the coming thaw and limited adaptation time is clear, though the external threat remains largely off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of navigating the known/unknown emerges organically from the concrete particulars of her craft. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of map-making, reweighting the value of "ignorance" as a frontier for innovation. Avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her profession. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm. Some minor poetic density in descriptions ("like a dark tooth") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor scaffold phrase appears ("practiced her craft with a groundedly imaginative approach"), telling a trait that is otherwise shown. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of an "ignorance cartographer" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. It is fully committed to, with specific world logic and a grounded, imaginative execution that avoids gimmickry. High originality.</comment>
