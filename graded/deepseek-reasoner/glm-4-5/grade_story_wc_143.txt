<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in professional duty and personal melancholy. Her "purposefully curious" nature drives micro-choices like adjusting the camera and scanning the crater, and her emotional state is embodied ("heart swelled with dawnlit melancholy"). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her resolve is steady without significant struggle, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with Elena enduring to document the fireflies' extinction. The cost is legible as the fireflies disintegrate and the mining team approaches. Causality is tight: the sand grain's dissolution triggers the photographic moment, and the sunrise escalates pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit summit constrains choice by providing the vantage point for photography, and the setting charges the final image as it transforms to sunlit. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "blue light," "breathing amplified in her helmet"), filtered through Elena's professional focus and emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: documenting extinction before habitat destruction. Pressure escalates through the impending sunrise and sand grain dissolution, narrowing Elena's options to capture the dance. Agency is demonstrated through her vigilance and photography, with cost felt as the fireflies vanish. One meaningful tightening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of progress versus preservation emerges organically through the fireflies' loss and Elena's actions, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: beauty preserved through images despite physical loss. Subtext operates in images like the dissolved sand grain, echoing transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a melancholic, observational tone. Internal perception is consistent, though some phrases ("dawnlit melancholy") verge on poetic abstraction. No dialogue, but prose rhythm supports the quiet, anticipatory atmosphere. Minor filter verbs ("she felt") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with varied sentence structures. However, slight repetitive phrasing ("dawning hush," "dawnlit melancholy") creates minor texture loops. Figurative language is cohesive and supports tone. Information density is high, with lines advancing both plot and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of lunar fireflies and their extinction is fresh and specific, transforming eco-conscious themes into a celestial setting. The sand grain timing mechanism is ingenious and irreplaceable. Emotional truth grounds the premise, avoiding gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
