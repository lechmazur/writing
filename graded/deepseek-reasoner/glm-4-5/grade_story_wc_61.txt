<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The being's core motivation is clear and consistent, driving all action. However, its form is abstract, more a personified concept than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion, limiting interior complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the being completes its mission, its purpose reaffirmed. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the "troubling serenity of its existence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly rendered and deeply integrated, its "troubling serenity" directly charging the final image. Sensory details are lush and purposeful, though the setting's pressure on choices is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the being's agency under the Accumulative lens, building through sonar pings and transit. The cost of its eternal mission is felt, though the external pressure on the being itself is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of gentle enlightenment versus destructive fire is coherent and emerges organically from the central action. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the moral is slightly explicit in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled. POV is stable and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. The poetic compression is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor figurative overloading occurs in phrases like "like tears from the cosmic garden's celestial flora," creating slight muddle, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of cosmic and sentimental tropes. The core concept feels inevitable and fresh, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical, accumulative structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
