<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear, rooted in her father's legacy and her own ethical stance. Her internal conflict—using deceptive tools for an honest purpose—is embodied throughout. The final choice feels earned, with the ink pot steadying her resolve. However, the epiphany about the "fair trade" feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in the moment of action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds. The plan is meticulously set up and executed with a clear, on-page closure (a Decisive Change) that carries cost—the breach of her employer's trust. The orientation is immediate, and the linkage from observation to action is tight. The only minor deduction is for the slightly summary-like feel of the final resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The funeral home setting is not just a backdrop; it actively pressures choices and supplies the crucial official seal. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional familiarity. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting, constraining and enabling her actions. The environment subtly mirrors the thematic tension between death and resurrection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (her security for his life) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens through her active waiting and the final breach. The cost is legible on the page in the weight of the seal and her acknowledged breach of trust. The escalation is driven by her agency, though the final execution of the plan proceeds without a significant, on-page complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of redeeming a corrupt legacy emerges organically from the specific use of the ink pot and the funeral home's "deathly vitality." The final image of the ink pot reflecting "the possibility of redemption" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. It avoids moralizing, though the phrase "mathematics of a fair trade" edges toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Maya's perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture that reflects her precise and determined nature. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, and the narrative effectively weaves reflection into present action. The voice is consistent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and character effectively. There is a minor artifact: the phrase "deathly vitality" feels slightly contrived and risks being a mixed metaphor, though it is thematically motivated. The rhythm is strong and supports the narrative's tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of a funeral home director and a con artist's ink pot is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The core concept feels organic to the character and her specific moral dilemma. The story commits fully to its premise, transforming familiar tropes (the redeemed child, the magical object) through grounded, specific detail and a clear cost.</comment>
