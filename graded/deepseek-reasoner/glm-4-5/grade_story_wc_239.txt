<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The witness's motivation is clear and intensifies, but their translucent, cosmic nature limits embodied, contradictory interiority. The final choice feels earned, yet the character remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking the micro-choices and emotional granularity for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost on the page at the stone altar. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density and pattern toward a final, decisive cadence shift that reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, but it functions more as a monumental backdrop than a constraint that actively pressures choices. The dictionary is the key micro-setting object that charges the final image, preventing a top score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a masterful density increase and pattern break, culminating in the final act of placing the dictionary on the altar. The cost of the universe's impending hiccup is a live, coherent pressure that forces the witness's final, decisive stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic reintegration emerges entirely through event and image, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of separation vs. connection, reweighting the premise through the final, silent image of completion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose is purposefully dense and patterned, though occasional phrases like "wanderingly exact" verge on self-conscious ornamentation that slightly disrupts the textural flow under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in listing contradictory truths ("creation and destruction, beginning and end...") and a register drift in the final paragraph's "language of pure mathematics and emotion," which feels slightly elevated for the POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic scale and intimate object (the dictionary) is fresh and specific. The core concept of spiral arbitration is transformed through grounded, particular mechanics, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk of high-concept abstraction pays off with coherence and stakes.</comment>
