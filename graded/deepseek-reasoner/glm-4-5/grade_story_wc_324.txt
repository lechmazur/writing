<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and rooted in her "persistently curious nature," compelling her to higher-stakes choices as the hearing aid's pulse intensifies. Her emotional state is embodied and specific, such as fingers tightening around the device. The final choice to contact security is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reeling hush of realization. A minor deduction for the slightly declarative "incidental heroism" label in the reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages: the urgent pulse leads Elena to the garden, the child's description connects to institutional knowledge, and the grandmother's photo provides the crucial evidence. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—the security detaining the man and the hearing aid calming. The orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of the antique device shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and twilight garden are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elena's professional perception. The hearing aid functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. However, the atrium itself, while atmospheric, does not actively pressure choices or alter tactics beyond providing a transition space, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the causal lens: the unusual pulse raises urgency, the child's dialogue deepens knowledge, and the photo revelation tightens options decisively. Agency is clear in Elena's choice to contact security, foreclosing the threat with a visible cost—the reeling hush of realization and the transformation of the photograph's purpose. The cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events—watchfulness beyond death, the purpose of unresolved echoes—without direct statement. The final image of the reframed photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A minor deduction for the slightly explicit "incidental heroism" phrase, which leans toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends the professional and the spiritual. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture, and the dialogue with the child feels natural and goal-driven. Elision is purposeful, such as the withheld contents of the photo until the crucial moment, and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. However, the phrase "reeling hush" is repeated three times, creating a minor template cadence that slightly dulls the closure image. No other significant artifacts or muddles are present in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise—a contact tracer for souls using an antique hearing aid—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of supernatural and procedural elements. It is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat, transforming the familiar trope of communing with the dead into a mechanism for tangible, life-saving intervention.</comment>
