<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance is a concrete, embodied internal conflict that drives their actions. Their "orderly intuitive mind" is shown through pattern recognition in the graffiti, not told. The final choice to return the foundation stone chip is a micro-choice revealing their values, an Earned Stasis that forecloses personal glory for collective power. A slight deduction for the final emotional state ("finally belonging") feeling slightly tidy after such a complex struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Escalation builds through the density of decoded messages and community participation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maya's work is complete, the community is empowered, and the culture is secured, with cost legible in the "just in case" hidden archive. The lens holds; the victory is collective and symbolic, not a single causal event. The final image of the spiral inside a circle joining generations is a potent, non-explanatory closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating carnival setting is intensely vivid and specific, filtered through Maya's perception ("scent of fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater"). It actively pressures choices, supplying the canvas (graffiti) and the context (corporate emissaries' arrival) for the conflict. The foundation stone chip is a micro-setting object that constrains Maya's final choice and charges the closure image when it is returned to the monument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is the increasing density and strategic use of the encoded messages, which successfully reweights the dominant stake (cultural survival). The cost is the three sleepless nights and the ongoing, vigilant need to preserve wisdom "just in case." Agency is clear in Maya's decoding and organizing. The pressure coheres from rumor to scheduled meetings, forcing the community's stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between tradition and change, resolved through a third way: encoded adaptation. The final image of the spiral inside a circle is a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question, celebrating collective action and continuity. Subtext operates powerfully in the graffiti and the old-timer's observation ("The water remembers..."). It avoids moralizing, trusting the reader to infer the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maya's perceptive, pattern-seeking mind. The prose has a distinct, slightly lyrical texture that reflects the setting's chaos and Maya's ordered interiority. The single line of dialogue from the old-timer feels natural and weighted with subtext. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "orderly intuitive network of visual communication," which leans academic, but it's a isolated slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong sensory detail. There is a minor instance of paraphrasing: "navigating corporate takeover" and later "navigate gentrification without losing its soul." The phrase "orderly intuitive network of visual communication" is slightly clunky and feels like a label. However, these are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure or causality. The final paragraphs are particularly strong and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise—using graffiti to encode resistance on a floating carnival city—is a highly original and specific synthesis. It feels inevitable in hindsight, not a gimmick. The concept is fully committed to and explored through its implications for communication, community, and cultural memory. The resolution through partial victory and continued vigilance feels authentic and fresh, avoiding a simplistic win/lose outcome.</comment>
