<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's motivation evolves credibly from academic bitterness to protective wonder, embodied in micro-choices like prioritizing witness over dissection. The final stance of "cultivating frostbitten hope" is an Earned Stasis foreclosing a path of conventional discovery with a felt cost. A minor deduction for the "cosmic joke" motivation, which is stated but not fully dramatized in conflicting on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where Aris's mission is redefined from capture to witness, charged by the final image of the arrowhead mirroring constellations. The Accumulative lens holds, building pressure through layered discoveries (arrowhead, phone, music) that culminate in a reweighted understanding. The cost is legible in Aris's renunciation of their original professional goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground garden is indispensable, constraining choice (the need for disguise) and charging the final image with its bioluminescent ecosystem. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and POV-filtered, reflecting Aris's expertise (e.g., "moon-petal flowers," "withering star-vine"). The setting's "harmony untamed" actively shapes the narrative's core concept and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's accumulating discoveries under the Accumulative lens, each deepening their knowledge and narrowing their options toward a stance of protection. The dominant stake of understanding versus control tightens meaningfully, culminating in the choice to document rather than dissect. The cost is the foreclosed path of academic validation, felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "harmony untamed," resisting didacticism through specific images like the gremlins' dance and the arrowhead's luminous patterns. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of human-cryptid coexistence through the final image of "cultivating frostbitten hope." The integration of concept and character arc is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by scientific observation ("document rather than dissect"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the contemplative tone. The single brief dialogue instance on the phone is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in the "cosmic joke" line, which feels slightly elevated compared to the POV's grounded observational lexicon. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and free of loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid research with cosmic, ecological themes feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "harmony untamed" is transformed from a thematic idea into a narrative mechanism that drives the plot and character arc. The specific, grounded details prevent abstraction, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
