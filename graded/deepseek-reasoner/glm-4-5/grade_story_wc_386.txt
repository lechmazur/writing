<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to expose the truth with careful methodology. Her internal conflict is shown through the weight of revelation and the choice to weave truth gently. The final renunciation of revenge for peace is earned by her prior choices. Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "salvage something pure," but the embodied cost in her careful approach mitigates this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the captain's peace) with a resonant reconfiguration of the snow globe's meaning, landing with cost ("glowing with a soft inner light"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through dream fragments and pattern recognition. The final image recharges prior material and the cost is legible. One micro-turn (discovering the cover-up) deepens knowledge effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and underwater setting are vividly specific and purpose-driven, filtering through Elara's professional and spiritual perspective. The snow globe and shrine constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency (e.g., "glass strangely warm"). The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (salvaging purity) and escalate through the discovery of the cover-up, forcing a higher-stakes choice on how to expose it. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens (piecing together patterns). The cost of careful truth-weaving is legible and alters tactics. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of truth and purity amid tragedy, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the open "windows of connection." Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "weaving truth carefully"). Thematic resonance arises from concrete particulars like the snow globe's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality ("like borrowed starlight"). Diction remains within Elara's lexicon, and compression is purposeful. The psychic distance is controlled, blending observation with interiority. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction, but the voice coheres under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Figurative language is consistent and enhances atmosphere without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "salvage something pure" phrases, but they serve thematic resonance. Information density is high, advancing story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving and ghost-whispering feels fresh and organic. The melted snow globe as a conduit is a non-obvious, specific choice that transforms familiar tropes. Emotional truth is prioritized over surface novelty. Risk-taking in structure (dream fragments) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
