<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's characterization is strong with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her scientific skepticism and inherited healing skill. Her evolution from seeking proof to embracing mystery is earned through on-page choices, particularly the bone-setting ritual. The final stance of acceptance feels credible and costs her certainty. Minor deduction for some telling of internal states rather than full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal/accumulative) holds strong. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as boundaries soften and a new constellation is glimpsed, with cost legible in the dissolved tooth and renewed mystery. Causality is tight from discovery to ritual. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice—the moonpetals are used in the ritual, and the maze dissolves according to Arthur's perception. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eleanor's POV. The environment charges the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (restore/transform worldview) and escalate through Eleanor's active ritual, which narrows options and summons the figure. Cost is felt in the loss of the tooth and certainty. Under the hybrid lens, pressure coheres through accumulative density and causal action. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action and image—skepticism vs. wonder, forgiveness, and transformative renewal. The "constellations" metaphor is earned and reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, particularly in Arthur's vulnerable line about bone-setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture without head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional complex syntax that slightly impedes momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but risks overwriting in peaks (e.g., "simultaneously flesh and shadow"). Figurative language is generally coherent but occasionally stacked. Rhythm is varied and purposeful. No major loops or artifacts, but some sentences could be more concise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with bone-setting healing, transforming familiar tropes through specific character and setting. The constellation metaphor is innovative and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in hybrid tone and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
