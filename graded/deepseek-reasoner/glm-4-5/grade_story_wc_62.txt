<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's fiercely meditative focus is embodied in tactile, specific actions (feeling carved letters, unspooling ribbon) that reveal a character under pressure. His motivation to discover the shape of collective grief is dramatized through a credible internal arc from emptiness to understanding, culminating in an earned renunciation of individual mourning for a collective act. The spectral mentor's guidance is integrated as a constraint that shapes his choices without diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered imagery (ribbon, butterflies, poems) that culminates in a decisive Conceptual Repricing of grief from individual to collective. The closure lands with undeniable cost: the near-depletion of the ribbon and the completion of the mentor's work. The walk to retrace steps functions as a meaningful cadence shift that deepens the thematic stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice, supplying the granite, light, and butterflies essential to the ritual and the craft. The ribbon and the gravestone are recurring objects that charge the final image, their tactile properties (worn smooth, fluid lines) directly shaping Elias's tactics and the closure's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: the decision to retrace his mentor's steps and then carve the collective monument represents a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the ribbon's depletion and the crystallization of his stance, foreclosing his previous path of individual markers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective grief emerges organically from the interplay of specific particulars—butterfly migration, the ribbon's knots, exchanged poems—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer embodied by the completed monument. The final image of "amber wings against ancient glass" reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a profound conceptual repricing of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature, with a rhythmic control that modulates between meditative focus and lyrical expansion ("thundering calm"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's professional and emotional priorities. Any elision (the mentor's exact nature) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. The prose is propulsive and devoid of scaffold or loops. A minor register drift occurs with "unsettled spirits," a slightly elevated phrase that briefly clashes with the otherwise grounded, tactile lexicon, but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated concept. The risk of a non-antagonistic, accumulative plot pays off, heightening stakes through pattern and image rather than causal confrontation. The story's vision feels singular and authentic.</comment>
