<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The navigator’s patchwork body and scars provide concrete, embodied interiority, and the final choice to build the bridge is a credible micro-choice under pressure. However, the interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat, holding it just below the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the navigator’s heart swells with "a mixture of pride and sorrow." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the intensifying moon phase and the ship's approach, culminating in the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and, crucially, the patina bronze censer foot are masterfully integrated. The object is not merely described; it constrains choice, heats up, and directly charges the final image and action, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens: the waxing moon's power forces a tactical choice to reconfigure the equipment. The cost is legible in the censer growing "almost too hot to touch," a tangible price paid for guiding the ship home.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of navigating loss emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the reverse migration and the navigator's scarred body. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"build not just pathways, but hope"—that reweights the geography of loss without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture and a controlled perceptual signature. A slight register drift occurs in the phrase "geography of loss became tangible, navigable terrain," which feels more abstract than the embodied voice elsewhere, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor overwriting appears in adjacent sentences like "Each piece told a story, each scar a landmark," creating a slight paraphrase loop that slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a patchwork navigator, a mystical censer, and a reverse migration is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated concept. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, and the commitment to the premise's lyrical, accumulative logic is total and authentic.</comment>
