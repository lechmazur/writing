<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guide's historically oriented ache is clear, but his motivation could be more viscerally dramatized beyond summary. Khira is a superb study in embodied defiance; her final song is an earned, cost-laden stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the thaw begins, reweighting the city's options. Cost is legible in the lingering dread pierced by resilience. A late-breaking rule for the lens's new power feels slightly un-teached.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto city is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The emerald lens and the baker's hollow function as micro-settings that actively constrain and enable the pivotal choice, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the guide's agency in offering the lens and Khira's choice to use it, a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. The cost—the dread versus the warmth—is legible, though the external thaw's direct link to the bread feels slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation emerges organically through the specific, tactile act of baking. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of identity without moralizing. "The bread remembers" is a profound, earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent POV with a perceptually rich signature. The prose is lush but controlled, with a rhythmic pulse that supports the textural drive. Minor risk of ornate density in high-pressure beats, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exquisite, high-density prose with strong rhythmic control. A tendency toward ornate description ("rosewater dread") creates minor density spikes, but the propulsion never fully stalls. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concept, setting, and stakes. The combination of a hive-mind city, cultural baking, and an emerald lens feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking in prose style heightens the stakes coherently.</comment>
