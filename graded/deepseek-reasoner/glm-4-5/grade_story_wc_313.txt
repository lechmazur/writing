<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation is clear, rooted in his "precisely humane" approach, and intensifies compellingly from observation to decisive action. His internal conflict is embodied in the discovery of the photograph and his aunt's defiance, which earns his final choice to "expunge the false narrative." The final renunciation of his old role is earned with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) as Thomas shifts from warden to truth-teller, with cost legible in his crystallized purpose. The causal lens holds strongly: the falling chime signals the town's emergence, the found label triggers memory, and the photographs reveal the truth, compelling his action. No orientation debt; all anchors are clear by the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the ridgeway and receding waters pressuring Thomas's vigil. The sapphire label and photographs act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. However, the "midnight ridgeway" itself, while atmospheric, does not actively alter tactics, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Thomas's agency under the causal lens: the discovery of each photograph deepens his knowledge and narrows his options until he must act. The cost is unmistakable in his decision to dismantle the narrative he "unwittingly upheld," a trade-off that redefines his life's work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming silenced history emerges organically from the resurfacing town and photographs, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Thomas's purpose to transform "individual memories into shared history," reweighting the premise without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a measured, observational rhythm that fits Thomas's character. The prose effectively uses free indirect style, though there is a slight register drift in the phrase "mirrored hush," which feels overly lyrical for his practical nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, the phrase "mirrored hush" is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles clarity in a peak beat. This minor artifact prevents a higher score but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a reservoir town resurfacing is a fresh, specific angle on themes of memory and erasure. The synthesis of the warden's duty with a personal, familial connection to the lost town feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens the stakes authentically.</comment>
