<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alaric's ethically diligent nature is embodied through his precise actions, and his internal conflict between professional exactness and communal neglect is dramatized, not summarized. His final choice to call for help is a decisive change earned by the carvings' guidance and his dawning realization, with the cost of his prior failure felt in his emotional plea. The townspeople function as a secondary pressure, forcing his stance to crystallize.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) under a Causal lens, landing with felt cost as Alaric shifts from solitary keeper to community participant. The pendulum's pause creates a coherent situational pressure that forces his stance to crystallize. Linkage is clean: the stopped clock→discovery of inscriptions→realization→call for help→communal restoration. The final image of the community reflected in the water makes the cost and reconfiguration legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clock tower and pendulum bob function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The tidal obsidian ridge is vividly described but is more ornamental than integral to the central conflict; its primary function is reflective and atmospheric rather than pressuring choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Alaric's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Alaric's discovery of the inscriptions forces a series of realizations that narrow his options, culminating in his decision to seek help. The dominant stake (restoring communal trust) is tested and deepened through this process. The cost of his prior neglect is made legible through his emotional crack and the collective work required for mending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between precision and community, articulated through the inscriptions and Alaric's arc without moralizing. The final image of the swinging pendulum and the reflected town offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of shared balance. The broken rake handle transforms from a mere object into a vessel of earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Alaric's professional focus. His internal voice modulates credibly under pressure, from precise observation to emotional realization. The single brief dialogue exchange ("I need helpers!") is natural and goal-driven, cracking with authentic emotion that advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that accelerate with emotional intensity. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("Alaric understood now—his meticulous winding had been correct in principle but wrong in practice"), creating a slight paraphrase loop. Figurative language ("searing reverie") is effective and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a clock winder's precision with a theme of communal responsibility feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of incremental absolution is transformed from an abstract idea into a dramatized process through the collective work of the townspeople. The broken rake handle as a vessel for wisdom is a specific, non-obvious choice that avoids cliché.</comment>
