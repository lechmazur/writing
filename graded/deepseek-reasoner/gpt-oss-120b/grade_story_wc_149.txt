<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a love that was both gentle and poisonous"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her fading. The "lovingly venomous" trait is more a stated summary than an active contradiction shown in-scene, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost as she fades and scatters. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence shifts. A persistent constraint (the debt, the bead) shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the greenhouse and bead functioning as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, it does not fully constrain a choice; her movement is largely unimpeded by the environment, preventing a 9+ score under the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using the bead to awaken the orchard. The cost is unmistakable and legible on the page in her final, fatal sigh and subsequent fading. The dominant stake (repaying the debt) tightens meaningfully to this climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of debt and redemption through the final image of the pulsing bead and transformed orchard. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the character's action and sacrifice, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and purposefully dense, with any elision taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats creates minor momentum drag, and a near-paraphrase loop occurs ("mournful elation" appears twice). Clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost bride, alchemical orchard, and transcendent debt feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. A bold, singular artistic stance.</comment>
