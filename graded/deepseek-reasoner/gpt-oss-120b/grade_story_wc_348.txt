<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal conflict (grief vs. scientific curiosity) acts simultaneously, and her final choice to build the bridge is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("she felt a loosened grief rise"). The symphonic-minded trait filters perception credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (grief loosened, purpose found) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, taught by the foam pattern. The lens holds from midpoint to end. Orientation is clear by line 2 ("braided ravine"). Cost is legible in the final bridge image and emotional release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine and river foam actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("frosted the canyon with foam that rose and fell in rhythmic arches"). The setting is integral to the climax, supplying the lattice pattern that enables the polymer design.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Mara's decision to trace the foam and build the scaffold narrows options and leads to the bridge. Cost is legible in her emotional shift and the tangible loss of the failed experiment. Pressure coheres and tightens through pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of separation/connection emerges organically from events and images (chrysalis, foam, bridge) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the bridge's creation and the child's chrysalis. No moralizing; complexity is embraced through cyclical renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("symphonically minded"). The symphonic metaphor is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within the POV's lexicon. Elision (e.g., lab return) is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports pressure. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "symphonically minded" which, while character-consistent, edges toward academic lexicon in opening. No loops or artifacts; rhythm is controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of polymer science and natural patterns feels inevitable. Specific, verifiable detail (lattice, foam patterns) creates freshness. Risk-taking in blending technical and lyrical modes heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded character choices.</comment>
