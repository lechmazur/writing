<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, intensifying motivation. The final renunciation is earned, though the emotional calibration in the final paragraph ("I whisper a promise") feels slightly performative, trending toward declarative rather than embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pattern recognition driving the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the memory is released, reconfiguring the market's meaning. The cost is legible in the fragment's dissolution and the protagonist's new role as a beacon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, woven through action. The market and paintings are richly evoked. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image, though it could more directly constrain a middle choice to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in deciphering the paintings, leading to a meaningful cadence shift. The cost of releasing the fragment is felt, though the pressure could tighten more palpably in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the act of translation and honoring overlooked histories. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the protagonist's role and the nature of memory through the lighthouse's essence becoming a shared guide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific texture. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, sustaining the accumulative pattern and paying it off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like an eternal instant"), slightly obscuring immediacy but not causality. No loops or scaffolding artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a between-worlds translator in an alchemist's market is fresh and specific. The synthesis of memory, object, and pattern-solving feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking in the lyrical mode that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
