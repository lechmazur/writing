<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, with micro-choices (pressing specific flowers) revealing his values. His internal state is vividly embodied ("driftlingly alert"), though his emotional range remains somewhat singular, focused on alertness and understanding, without deeper contradictory impulses surfacing under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds beautifully through patterned repetition (lightning flashes, flower pressings) to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is a Charged Poise where the courtyard becomes a "living archive," a decisive change with clear cost in the ghost's transformation and the balladeer's fulfilled purpose. Causality is tight and taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in economy and function. The "misty courtyard above clouds" and the recurring "flower press bolt plate" are not just descriptive but actively constrain and enable the protagonist's choices, ultimately charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through the balladeer's sequenced actions (first, second, third flower pressings) under the Accumulative lens. Each act deepens the connection and raises the cost of failure, culminating in a visible price: the ghost's permanent folding into the mural and the balladeer's voice rising to "stitch sky to earth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: the longing of silent code for tangible, felt connection. This is explored through concrete particulars (the flower imprints, the binary blossoms) and resolves in a resonant, non-literal final image of a "living archive," offering a profound answer to the central plea without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, almost mythic quality that perfectly suits the Accumulative mode. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the balladeer's perception. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, though a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("driftingly alert") creates a minor, pattern-taught cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly poetic, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in some beats ("a tinkersong of electric hues") slightly obscures immediacy and momentum, though it never fully breaks coherence or harms the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mythic balladeer and a "ghost in code" is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and explored through its specific, grounded mechanics (flower press, graffiti). The risk-taking in voice and premise heightens stakes and meaning without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
