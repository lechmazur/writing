<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance and orderly intuitive mind are concrete, embodied traits that drive her choices under pressure. Her final decision to send the phoenix message is a credible micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values. However, the internal contradiction of her allegiance is more summarized than dramatized in simultaneous scene action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the community's unified response and the phoenix mural reconfigure options, postponing privatization. The causal lens holds firmly: Mira's discovery of the chip directly leads to her graffiti campaign, which reorganizes the stalls and forces the council's hand. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft city setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources; the riverbank's reallocation is a tactical choice directly affecting the outcome. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("perpetual carnival lights flickering against the misty dawn"), filtered through Mira's professional priority to absorb cultural shock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: her use of the chip and graffiti campaign directly tightens options, forcing a community response that alters the investors' plans. The cost is legible in her "hopeful desperation" and the visible trade-off of moving stalls, which protects the artisans at a potential cost to tourism efficiency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between communal joy and corporate order, resisting a tidy moral. The final phoenix image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question. However, the theme of "hopeful desperation" is occasionally stated rather than fully earned through implication alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "hopeful desperation that rose like steam from the river." The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm. Some minor register drift occurs near the end ("culture shock absorber" feels slightly clinical), but the internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. However, figurative language is occasionally over-dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "hopeful desperation that felt like a tide turning back"), creating a slight muddle that slightly dulls the closure image's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The combination of a raft city and a culture shock absorber is a fresh, specific synthesis. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on resistance to gentrification. While highly effective, the concept of encoded graffiti as a resistance blueprint is a known trope, though it is executed with specificity here.</comment>
