<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies, embodied through specific micro-choices like accepting the sugar and the weekly ritual. Liora's "patiently nimble" grace is shown but could be more deeply integrated into a specific action with cost. The final renunciation of mere decoding for living dialogue is earned, though Liora's internal contradiction is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and holds, building through pattern and cadence to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with felt cost in the protagonist's humbled fluency and the building's silent grammar. The sugar borrowing is a minor coincidental complication that does not resolve the core conflict, but it is integrated into the pattern and does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower are not just backdrop; they actively pressure the scene, constraining the meeting's secrecy and charging the final image. The antique desk seal and the mossy bench function as micro-settings that constrain choice and focus attention. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through the POV's scholarly, desperate curiosity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—the decision to borrow sugar and accept the pact deepens the stake from scholarly inquiry to a transformative, conspiratorial dialogue. The cost is legible in the felt shift to "newly fluent" and the commitment to weekly rituals, foreclosing a simpler path. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the seal, the lies, and the borrowed sugar, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: learning to hear heartbeats, not just decode inscriptions. The final image of the window latch "awaiting translation" offers a conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, particularly around the "agreed upon lies."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptive signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the meteor shower's cadence. Purposeful elision (the specifics of the language) is taught and pays off at closure. POV is stable and the narrator's certainty is well-calibrated to what can be known.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "flecting hymn," "pulse with an ancient rhythm"), applying slight figurative pressure without fully obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The opening and closing lines are exceptionally strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—interrogating a dead tutor to learn a language of stone—is a highly original and specific synthesis. The integration of the meteor shower, borrowed sugar, and antique seal feels organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven. The story commits fully to its lyrical, mysterious vision without hedging or resorting to familiar templates.</comment>
