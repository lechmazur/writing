<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with eroded ambitions and chronological confusion shaping her micro-choices. Her final renunciation of regret is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and the ghost's transformation. The negotiation with her younger self is a credible, flawed struggle that avoids diagnostic language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with palpable cost in the final image of tears and fresh roots. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks (spiral of fragments, camera wheel's click) reweighting stakes. Orientation is immediate and functional, with the kinetic lagoon and carousel established within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and carousel are not just atmospheric but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The disposable camera wheel functions as a micro-setting, its mechanical rhythm and broken lens directly shaping the negotiation's outcome. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Mara's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as each collected fragment adds weight to the ghost and narrows her options. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the ghost's growing solidity and Mara's tears. The final trade—stories for a memory—is a decisive tightening that forces a renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of eroded ambitions and regret emerges organically from the specific negotiation with the ghost, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—carrying stories forward as fresh roots—that reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's pleading eyes and the lagoon's fractured stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sand down by endless cycles." The voice modulates under pressure without convergence, and the elision of the ghost's dialogue is purposeful and legible. The prose rhythm expertly mirrors the lagoon's kinetic churn and subsequent stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with figurative language that consistently advances character and atmosphere. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats but does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, varying rhythm to match emotional intensity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a kinetic lagoon, chronological confusion, and negotiating with one's ghost is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and ghost dialogue heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
