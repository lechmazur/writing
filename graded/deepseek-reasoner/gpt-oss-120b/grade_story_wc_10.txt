<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is profoundly embodied through calloused hands, silk scarf, and pulse memory. Her motivation to "rectify the silence" drives the entire narrative, culminating in an earned Charged Poise where her endurance transforms trauma into art. The final choice to share the song is rooted in prior causality and carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses (fear/longing) are rendered through the heat-map's crimson/azure, not alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density of sensory and emotional detail intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with undeniable cost in the final image of the case resting "like a heart that had found its rhythm." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the winterglass conservatory and Mara's goal are anchored within the first paragraph. The prototype device is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables Mara's choice, its glass walls essential for the sound's resonance. The tuning fork case is a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional (rope-calloused hands) and emotional priorities. The environment evolves causally, growing warmer as her emotion feeds back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to activate the device is a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake (silence vs. song). The cost is legible in the vibration that "smoothed a jagged memory" and the visible "rose veins" on the glass. Pressure coheres through emotional density rather than causal turns, perfectly suiting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "unshaken marvels," resisting moralizing through the specific, non-literal image of silence transformed into song. The final chord "trembling like a lighthouse beam" offers a resonant answer to the central question of enduring trauma. Subtext operates powerfully in the "silently expressive" case and the visitors feeling "a promise of redemption."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the breath of frost," "pulse of residual heat"). Syntax and rhythm modulate beautifully with emotional intensity, particularly in the climax: "The music did not erase the past storms but wove them into a tapestry of sound." No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("frozen cathedral," "ghostly harp"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax without obscuring clarity. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery, sound technology, and glass architecture feels fresh and inevitable. The heat-mapping device is a non-obvious ingenuity that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates through unique particulars (e.g., "the wild tumble of the sea" remembered in the body). Bold risk-taking in lyric mode pays off at closure.</comment>
