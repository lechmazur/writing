<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final renunciation of solitary burden is earned by prior causality, though some emotional states verge on diagnostic self-awareness ("felt the weight lift").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where shared burdens reconfigure meaning with felt cost ("burden lift, not removed but shared"). Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern of stars/glyphs/telegram pays off cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory and variable stars actively constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Mara's expertise. The daylily scent and star pulses are tactile and integrated into action, elevating the setting beyond ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as she aligns the telescope with her heartbeat. Cost is legible ("felt the weight lift"), though the stakes shift subtly from decoding to sharing without a full trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the telegram, stars, and final revelation, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the crystal and lullaby image, though the phrase "heal the world with words" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually signature style ("veil of restless night"). Some register drift occurs in peak beats ("heal the world with words"), but elision is taught and paid off, and rhythm controls pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic with strong rhythm, but figurative language occasionally stacks ("curling like a sigh," "glowed like distant lanterns"), risking minor clarity loss in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; momentum remains propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial decoding and shared emotional burdens feels inevitable and original. The daylily telegram and variable stars are highly specific and irreplaceable, with risk-taking in lyric mode that heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
