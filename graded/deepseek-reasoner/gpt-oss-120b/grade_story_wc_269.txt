<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her past trauma, compelling her choices. However, her internal state is occasionally told ("her mind was periodically eternal") rather than fully embodied in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with patterns (tapping, the atlas) building to a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with clear cost: the rediscovered path is a bridge to restoration, charged by the final image of the station "moored yet drifting."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The station and the atlas page are masterfully integrated as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the characters' professional priorities, creating a vivid, lived-in world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift—the discovery of the watermark—which deepens the stakes and narrows their focus. The cost is legible in the reweighting of the atlas's tear from a loss to a clue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of loss, memory, and listening. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that silence in the reef's chemistry maps the disappeared paths, reconfiguring the meaning of their work without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, measured rhythm that mirrors the story's thematic concerns. The perceptual signature is consistent, and purposeful elision (e.g., "periodically eternal") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of telling ("Mara realized...") in a high-pressure beat slightly interrupts the otherwise flawless dramatization, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate change, cartography, and ritual is fresh and specific. The core concept of "delayed revelation" is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices, making the ending feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
