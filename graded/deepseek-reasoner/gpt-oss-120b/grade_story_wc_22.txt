<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and rooted in ancestral duty, compelling his specific actions. His internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., "listened as a priest reads liturgy"). A meaningful change is earned as he successfully decodes the calls and scatters the seeds, feeling the weight of his ancestors lift. The final endurance—his commitment to continue—is credible and charged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through the density of sensory and symbolic detail, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with undeniable cost and transformation: "the garden’s scent rose, promising that even a battlefield could become a field of flowers." The lens holds perfectly, and the final image reconfigures the meaning of the place.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The jetty's timber "sighed under his weight," and its transformation from battlefield to garden is the story's core action. The environment is a character, with sensory details filtered through the coachman's purpose-driven perception. The final image of the jetty as a "thin ribbon of hope" is inseparable from the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the coachman's agency under the Accumulative lens, as he listens, decodes, and acts. The dominant stake (reclaiming the scarred ground) is signaled early and tightens through the act of scattering the seeds. The cost is legible in the image of the "wounded sand" and the "reef’s death [as] a wound that could never fully heal," making the renewal feel earned and costly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of a garden reclaiming a battlefield, resisting any direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and the coachman's realization. The concept of "submerged concord" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional payoff. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through its particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the coachman's specific, lyrical perception. The voice has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, even under the pressure of the ritual. While some sentences are complex, the elision is purposeful and legible, serving the accumulative mode. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting in peak beats, such as "narrow vastness" appearing multiple times, which slightly dulls the closure image through repetition. However, the language is largely precise and purposeful, advancing the story without scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a coachman, dead languages, and bird calls to fertilize a former battlefield is a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise, and the combination of elements is organic and singular.</comment>
