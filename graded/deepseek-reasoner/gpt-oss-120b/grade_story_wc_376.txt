<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from refusing the council to seeking lost conversations. Embodied emotions and micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of safety for truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost when the vent surges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where candor physically redirects the toxic sky. Cost is legible in the plate's return to luminous green and vines unfurling. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: the zinc plate's reactivity dictates actions, the toxic sky creates urgency. Sensory details are purposefully selective (taste of rust, bioluminescent ferns). The greenhouse itself becomes a character that breathes and responds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: refusing council, piecing map, uncorking bottles. Each action tightens options and deepens stakes. Cost is visible in the plate's fading glow and the sky's retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: candor physically heals the world. Subtext operates through the plate's reactivity and bottled conversations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent POV. Lyric compression is purposeful and taught early. Diction remains within character's lexicon except minor register drift in "testament that even in a toxic world."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language serves pattern and payoff. Minor register drift in final paragraph ("testament") prevents higher score. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological and communicative restoration. The zinc plate as truth-detector is original and irreplaceable. Risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off in closure. Specificity anchors universal themes.</comment>
