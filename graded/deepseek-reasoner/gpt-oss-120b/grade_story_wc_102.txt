<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and spiritually rooted, compelling his high-stakes choice to release the love. His embodied connection to the environment and the tear shows character under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, though the internal contradiction could be more active in the scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with visible cost (the tear's purpose fulfilled, its glow dimmed). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the intensifying pattern of breath and light. Causality is tight; each beat arises from the prior, culminating in the transformative release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Milo's choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through his perception. The environment evolves with the action, its blooming state a direct result of the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the accumulative lens, his controlled breathing deepening the stakes and narrowing his options to a single, costly action. The price of the tear's dimming is legible on the page, foreclosing its future use and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of compassion and unused love emerges organically from the specific events and the central image of the reservoir. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed viaduct and released sparks, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates with the emotional intensity. The prose has a strong rhythmic control, though there is a slight risk of overwriting in the peak descriptive beats ("foggy lucidity"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in the climax ("foggy lucidity," "symphony of healed hearts"), which slightly risks figurative muddle but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "pilgrim of sparks" is transformed into a specific, grounded character and conflict. The synthesis of camera obscura, spiritual quest, and mythological object feels fresh and inevitable, with bold risk-taking that coheres and heightens stakes.</comment>
