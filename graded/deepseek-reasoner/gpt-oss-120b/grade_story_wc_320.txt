<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selin's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to discard linear assumptions. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in her pragmatic interaction with the tower's technology. A micro-choice to whisper her intention reveals her hierarchy of values, and her final renunciation (letting the glow fade) is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on professional competence in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the shard is redefined from a relic to a "living key," reweighting the premise with undeniable cost (the city's rebirth). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift (static hiss into melody). The cost is legible on-page as light returns to hidden pathways and villagers emerge. Every beat accumulates toward this resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The radio tower's quantum coil and rusted flagstones are tactile resources Selin must use and navigate. The gorge's hollows whispering the same secret as the chord brilliantly mirrors the internal state and charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through Selin's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a single, powerful deepening: the act of tuning reweights the dominant stake (survival/decay vs. rebirth) by changing knowledge. The cost is unmistakably legible as power banks flicker awake and hidden pathways are revealed. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, and the trade-off (using the shard's power but not hoarding it) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of beginnings in endings emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The final image of the "Genesis in Echo" crystal archive offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. The concept is fully integrated, resisting tidy morals for a complex, earned wisdom. The shard's transformation from propaganda to living key is the thematic engine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Selin's technical yet wondrous voice. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping or register drift. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphorical phrasing that, while beautiful, slightly challenges immediacy in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, with high information density and rhythmic control. Read-aloud quality is strong. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a cluster of complex figurative language in the opening sentence ("hung like a broken harp"), which, while pattern-taught, creates a slight momentum drag at the very start. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a celestial signal interpreter in a rusted tower tuning a Hollywood shard is a fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling combination. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with conceptual integrity. The fantasy practicality tone is a bold, specific choice that heightens stakes and coherence. It transforms familiar tropes through grounded, lived-in detail.</comment>
