<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reimagine civilization is clear and rooted in her past as a defunct revolutionary, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her poetically inclined trait is demonstrated through her verse, which actively resolves the conflict. However, her internal contradiction and the embodied cost of her "burnished sorrow" are rendered with a slight abstraction, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the dispute dissolves into a "collaborative chorus," with the cost of Lira's "burnished sorrow" felt on the page. The linkage is through pattern and cadence, with the "time becomes visible" phenomenon and the storm providing a coherent, taught structure that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is not just a backdrop; it actively constrains and enables the plan. The observatory's mirrors are the essential tool, and the "seasonal storms" and asteroid's core pulse are integral resources that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift—the moment the shard's light projects "a tapestry of forgotten languages." This reweights the dominant cultural stake, forcing a stance crystallization from the elders. The cost is the palpable "burnished sorrow" that fills the chamber, a melancholic price for renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming conflict into creation through art emerges entirely from the particulars of the shard, the mirrors, and Lira's verse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "true revolution was no longer a battle of arms but a symphony." It avoids moralizing, embracing complex ambiguity between loss and potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("burnished sorrow," "gilded relic"). The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's poetic sensibility. The single line of dialogue at the end is a purposeful, voice-motivated capstone that avoids exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly poetic but risks overwriting in its density; a few phrases like "burnished sorrow" are repeated, creating a slight template cadence. However, the rhythm is masterful and supports the accumulative drive, and every sentence advances atmosphere and character. No clarity is lost at the crucial closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque asteroid, an archaeological dispute, and a revolutionary using poetry and refraction is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high emotional specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk of a highly lyrical, accumulative structure pays off magnificently.</comment>
