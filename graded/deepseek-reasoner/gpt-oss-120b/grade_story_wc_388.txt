<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her observational trait is embodied in micro-choices like sorting paper by scent. The final renunciation—leaving the diamond to protect the stillpoint—is earned, though the transition to this community-minded stance could be more deeply motivated on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) via the diamond's inscription, reweighting the premise from a physical place to a mental state with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds: her reassembly of the map directly leads to the discovery. The final image of the shimmering orchard makes the cost/benefit legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail that pressures choice. The environment constrains tactics (navigating dust storms) and the final image of the trees shimmering with "untainted light" is charged by the preceding action, perfectly mirroring the thematic shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: the storm intensifies, forcing her to work by lantern light, and the final puzzle piece snapping into place is a meaningful tightening. The cost of her effort is felt, and the stake (finding truth) is tested concretely throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and the potent final image. The inscription, "Only in stillness does the truth shine," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the plot's resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, observant texture that reflects Mira's character. The only minor flaw is a slight register drift in phrases like "excavate truth from comfortable lies," which feels slightly academic for in-scene thought, though it is thematically justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor rhythm issue exists in the climax: the sentence "Mira felt a pulse in the air, a subtle shift as if the world held its breath" uses a slightly soft filter verb ("felt") at a key moment, slightly dulling the immediacy of this pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic debunker and psychic stillpoint is fresh and specific. The core concept is executed with conviction, transforming the "cursed object" trope through a grounded, psychological resolution that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
