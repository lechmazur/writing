<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation is concrete and character-particular, rooted in mapping loss rather than generic grief. Her micro-choices (building the engine, recording coordinates) align with this motive under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the censer foot's warmth syncing with her heartbeats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases through censer foot fluctuations and phone calls, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as ships return. Closure lands with cost: the censer foot's patina deepens with sorrow, and the navigator's acceptance is felt. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (guiding engine pulses) and charging the final image (its incense mingling with sea breeze). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (incense and rust smell, glinting patina). The station's cracked walls and thin air pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: her building the engine deepens stakes, narrowing options to a single outcome. Cost is legible in the censer foot absorbing sorrow and the navigator's heartbeats syncing with its pulses. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: reverse migration as necessity to map loss is answered non-literally through the ships' return. Subtext operates in images (censer foot as compass, ships mirroring constellations). No moralizing; the ending offers resonant ambiguity through charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps"). Diction remains within character lexicon; syntax reflects her navigator mindset. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., engine construction) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and no loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught (moon phases, patina) and pays off. Minor artifact: "geography of loss" appears twice, but not in peak beats, so no deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable: censer foot, reverse migration, and signal station cohere uniquely. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific lived detail and moral calculus.</comment>
