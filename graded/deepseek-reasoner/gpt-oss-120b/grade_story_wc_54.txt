<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The intern's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a functionally creative mindset. Her micro-choices under pressure, like using the sextant to calibrate voltage, reveal her values and competence. The final, earned stasis of "stoic wonder" is a credible endurance foreclosing a path with a felt cost. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward diagnostic language, e.g., "functionally creative," though it is quickly embodied in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing in the final image of the spiral—a reweighting of purpose with conceptual cost. Causality is tight; her actions directly lead to the terminal's revival. The cost is legible in the "quiet anthem" inside her, a felt price for the engineered hope. The lens holds from the pattern-seeking opening to the conceptual closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choices—the broken conduits and main artery are not just backdrop but the medium of her calculations. The sextant, a micro-setting object, charges the final image and is used tactically. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her engineer's POV, e.g., corridors as "a vector of unfinished plans."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens, through the accumulating density of her calculations and actions. The dominant stake (resurrecting hope) tightens meaningfully as she progresses from tracing flows to drafting new equations. The cost is visible in the terminal's inhaled breath and her internal "quiet anthem," a trade-off for the renewed purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of engineering and hope, resolved in the non-literal final image of the "spiral of purpose." The concept of "maze of intentions" is transformed from a tangle into a mapped, resolved order. Subtext operates powerfully in the sextant's redefinition from navigation tool to ethical compass, avoiding any direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends technical precision ("vector of unfinished plans") with lyrical wonder ("weight of a distant star"). The voice is consistent and effectively modulated under pressure. There is a minor, occasional drift into a slightly elevated register ("stoic wonder"), but it remains largely within the character's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythm. However, minor artifacts are present, including some synonym churn ("resurrected hope," "renewed purpose") and a tendency toward compound abstractions ("ethicial currents of reclaimed technology") that slightly dull immediacy at peak beats. The closure image remains clear and unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard engineering concepts with a lyrical, emotional quest is fresh and specific. The core concept of redirecting flows to resurrect a structure—and its sentiment—is a non-obvious, ingenious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The transformation of the sextant from a relic into an ethical compass is a bold, successful risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
