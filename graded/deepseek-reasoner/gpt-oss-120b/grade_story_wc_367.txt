<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong with embodied emotion ("smile that disguised the weight of centuries") and a clear, earned final choice. However, the storm herald's internal contradiction is less dramatized; his "paradox of joy and mourning" is stated rather than shown through conflicting micro-choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the world's premise through the final image of a "shadowed brilliance." The cost is legible in the "strange, joyous melancholy" felt by the world, and the lens holds consistently through patterned intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern are not merely decorative; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The lighthouse's stone "humming" and the prism's mechanics are integral to the ritual's execution, fulfilling the 9+ test with high specificity and purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with the protagonists' decisive act of steering the light serpent creating a clear, meaningful tightening. The cost is visible in the "ancient shadows stir[ring]" as a direct consequence, though the price paid feels slightly conceptual rather than viscerally personal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of rebirth through shadow emerges organically from the core ritual and the final image of a dawn "painted with hope." It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "shadowed elation" of the ending embodies the thematic complexity perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently controlled, with a lyrical, perceptually specific texture ("sapphire currents," "chorus of silver syllables"). The single POV is stable. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence emerges in a few consecutive sentences starting with "The" in the final third, and the phrase "shadowed elation" is repeated, slightly dulling its charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse ritual, prophetic ocean symbols, and a post-newspaper epoch feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular vision that avoids cliché or derivative patterns.</comment>
