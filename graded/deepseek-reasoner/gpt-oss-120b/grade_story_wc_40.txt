<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s reticence and motivation are clear and consistent, driving her choices. Her emotional progression from weathered innocence to quiet resolve is embodied and earned. However, the internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized under pressure, holding back a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara’s realization reconfigures the library’s meaning. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with patterns intensifying to a cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final image of her resolve and the offered page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shadowed library and crystal are masterfully rendered, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV’s perception. The environment is a crucible that actively shapes the narrative’s outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under the accumulative lens, her attentive observation deepening the stakes. The cost of her pursuit is felt in the transformation of her innocence into resolve. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient and well-executed for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of language as a living pulse emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the crystal’s hum. A slight tendency toward thematic declaration in the climax (“a living pulse of humanity”) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scholarly voice that modulates beautifully under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision and compression are taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but density approaches overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractured sequences that fractured time"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "suspended hush." However, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image remains potent and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a sonically reflective crystal encoding linguistic history is strikingly original and executed with high conceptual integrity. The synthesis of idea, character, and setting feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the poetic, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
