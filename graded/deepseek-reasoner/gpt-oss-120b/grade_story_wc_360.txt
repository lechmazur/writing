<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies believably. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final realization that she must continue to disorient herself is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction in peak beats that slightly distances embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the halo fragment cracks, releasing a cascade of light—a dazzling proof of her quest with clear, felt cost. The pattern of transposing empathy builds density and culminates in a decisive cadence shift that reweights the stake. Orientation is clear and purposeful from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and halo fragment are vividly rendered and function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's professional POV. The environment subtly mirrors internal states and evolves with the action, culminating in the workshop becoming a "galaxy of murmured feelings."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the repeated act of transposing personalities into the fragment. This deepens the central stake of understanding emotion, culminating in the fragment's cracking—a meaningful intensification that reweights the dominant stake with a visible, felt cost. Pressure remains coherent and builds to the final, decisive image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of emotion as a transposed function emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final theorem and the cascade of light, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through purposeful ambiguity that lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction that slightly clashes with the POV's established lexicon in a few peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats, creating occasional density that slightly obscures immediacy and momentum (-0.3). Despite this, information density is high, and the closure image remains powerful and clear. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of letterpress operation, borrowed empathy, and mathematical emotion. The combination feels organic and singular, not a checklist. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains legible. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>
