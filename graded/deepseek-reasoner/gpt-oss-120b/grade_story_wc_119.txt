<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, embodied emotion is strong (e.g., "surge of purpose"), and the final choice to encode lives is earned. However, interior contradiction acts more as alternating summary than simultaneous impulses in the scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal/hybrid lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the lighthouse's flicker and the visitor's rush of knowledge. Orientation is immediate, and the microdot's introduction tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting actively constrains choice and charges the final image (e.g., aligning lenses with coils). Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens; the microdot specs introduce a method that narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is legible in the visitor's revelation and the lighthouse's conspiratorial flicker, foreclosing the path of secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges organically through events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The final image of the gull carrying the message provides purposeful ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the transition to the visitor) are taught early and pay off at closure. POV is stable and voice is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("open secret spilling like the tide") and a slight template cadence in the opening prevent a higher score, but no artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of espionage and prophecy tropes through specific, grounded details. Risk-taking in the hybrid structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
