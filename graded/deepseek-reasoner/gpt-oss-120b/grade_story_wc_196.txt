<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amelia’s “broken-hearted” state and motivation to “magnify small kindnesses” are embodied in concrete actions like tracing silhouettes and her micro-choice to present the button. Her internal contradiction—grief versus hope—is shown, not told, and her final choice to continue the work is earned by the preceding discovery. A minor deduction for the supervisor's swift, under-pressure agreement feeling slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Amelia’s stance crystallizes into continued, hopeful work. The cost is legible in her “heart still broken but steadier.” A minor deduction for the magical mechanism of the button’s light projection feeling slightly under-explained, creating a small causality question.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The foster care file room is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling choice through dust patterns, light, and file spines. It is not a backdrop but a participant, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Amelia’s archival perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening discovery of stories, culminating in the successful persuasion of the supervisor. The dominant stake—giving voice to the forgotten—tightens as the method proves itself. The cost is the emotional weight Amelia carries, though the external conflict with the supervisor resolves a touch easily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming lost histories and the power of small kindnesses emerges organically from the button, the dust, and Amelia’s actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the blank file awaiting its story, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Deeply integrated and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that consistently filters the world through Amelia’s archival sensibility. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue from the supervisor is tonally consistent and serves a clear goal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally exquisite with high information density. Minor artifacting occurs with slightly overwrought phrases like “unfurling like a silent flag” and “a pulse of hope humming through the dust,” which momentarily stall momentum. However, the line-level propulsion is strong, and the closure image is clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central conceit of a magical button revealing stories through dust and light is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. It synthesizes the familiar (grief, archives) into a fresh, specific, and emotionally truthful vision. The risk of magic realism pays off by heightening the stakes and coherence.</comment>
