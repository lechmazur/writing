<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique nature as an oracle; her internal conflict between the weight of a swallowed truth and the search for clarity is concrete and embodied. The final renunciation feels earned, though the diagnostic phrase "auroral sorrow" slightly abstracts her emotional state at a peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the layering of sensory data and internal reflection. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the truth's weight shifts from internal burden to something carried outward, with cost legible in the final image of the glowing paper and lifted chest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is indispensable, its instruments and atmospheric pressure directly constraining Mirela's choice to adjust the barometer. The botanical illustration functions as a micro-setting, its physical properties (ink bleeding with heat) charging the final image and enabling the core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in smudging the illustration and adjusting the barometer, which deepens her knowledge and narrows her options. The cost is felt in the final realization, though the external pressure from the environment remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of measuring intangible truth through the smudging of perceived certainties is fully integrated and emerges organically from the core action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the truth's weight becoming both heavy and light, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice suited to an oracle. The prose is highly controlled, though a slight register drift occurs in phrases like "auroral sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's otherwise concrete perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though a minor mixed metaphor occurs ("brittle leaf" and "stone" for certainty/truth). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, and plot. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fault-tolerant oracle, a botanical data sheet, and a metaphysical quest for truth is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "swaying certainties" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and the protagonist's unique methods.</comment>
