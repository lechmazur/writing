<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("positively wistful" gaze, trembling fingers). The final choice to share the jars is earned by prior causality of collecting sounds, with visible cost in foreclosing solitary existence for communal purpose. Micro-choices under pressure (lifting the music box, arranging jars) reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the poet's purpose solidifies as a "bridge of verse and vibration." Cost is legible in the weight lifting from his shoulders and the foreclosed path of solitary wandering. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (cracked shutters, sand-torn wood) and charging the final image. The feral loft and music box are tactile and integral to the poet's mission. Sensory detail is selective and reflects POV bias, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each captured sound deepens the stake of cultural preservation. Cost is unmistakable in the poet's transformation from wanderer to translator, foreclosing his solitude. Pressure coheres through the methodical jar-filling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (music box, jars, dunes) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to redemption through intergenerational connection. Subtext operates in implication, such as the music box's acknowledgment of his quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Voice modulates with emotional intensity ("lonesome splendor" to "shared hymn"). Diction remains within the poet's plausible lexicon, and syntax reflects his contemplative state. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("billowing like a sigh," "dust motes to dance like tiny planets"). Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vagrant poet, sound preservation, and redemption feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
