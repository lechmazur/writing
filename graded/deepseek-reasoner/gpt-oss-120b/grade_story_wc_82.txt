<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, compelling high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("luminous torment"). However, the final choice is more a culmination of a process than a dramatic on-page decision under pressure, slightly muting the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with clear cost felt in the "paradoxical peace." The pattern of polishing and folding is taught early and pays off. A minor deduction for a slight ambiguity in the "descends while ascending" mechanic's causal impact on the process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional, purposeful detail. The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are not just vivid but actively constrain and enable the ritual, charging the final image. Sensory selection is masterful, reflecting the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the ritual and the approaching temporal marker ("after the shadow detaches"). The cost of the "luminous torment" is legible. Agency is demonstrated through the sustained, deliberate action of polishing and folding, which narrows the emotional options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief through craft emerges powerfully from the specific events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the cranes among the stars and the "paradoxical peace."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent, and compelling perceptual signature. The lyrical, precise prose is perfectly suited to the POV and concept. POV is stable, and the patterned, elevated diction is fully voice-motivated and taught from the opening lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. Minor deduction for a potential density issue; the consistent high level of figurative language, while beautiful, occasionally flirts with overwhelming the core action in a few lines, though it never fully obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream recording, grief work, and a floating world feels fresh, organic, and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and ritual, avoiding cliché.</comment>
