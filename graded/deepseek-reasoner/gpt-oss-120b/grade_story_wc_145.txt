<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and specific, with micro-choices like tracing the condensation and aligning the antenna revealing her motivation. Her subtle confidence is demonstrated through action, not told. The final choice to record coordinates is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for the "dry-witted" label, which is stated but not fully dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara steps outside to witness the first sign of thaw, reconfiguring her hope and dread with visible cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the intensifying pattern of condensation, the falcon's return, and the ice's song. A persistent constraint (the frozen lake) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The outpost's transmitter and the frozen lake's concealed streams are resources and obstacles. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional bias ("maps that no longer matched the world"). The environment evolves causally with the story's events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with Mara's actions (lighting the lamp, using the glass, aligning the antenna) deepening the stakes. The cost is legible in the "calm that bordered on dread" and the "inner tremor of hope." The dominant stake (mapping the origin) tightens meaningfully as the first vein of water appears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of convergence and origin emerges organically from events and images (rivers, condensation veins, falcon's path). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the glinting water vein, reweighting the premise that "every river is born from ice, and ice is born from silence" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice suited to an atlas editor ("a secret script formed by breath and cold"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though a single minor filter phrase ("she knew the lake concealed...") slightly dulls immediacy. The lyrical compression under pressure is effective and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. However, a slight scaffold phrase ("a reminder that every river is born from ice") and a minor mixed metaphor ("its mirror-like hush amplifying the quiet dread") prevent a higher score. Information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere or story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, mysticism, and a frozen setting feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "singular convergence" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the plot and imagery. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels earned.</comment>
