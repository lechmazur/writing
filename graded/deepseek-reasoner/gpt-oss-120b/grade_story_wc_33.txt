<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his high-stakes choice to deploy the storm. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("feeling the storm’s electric sigh"). The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the storm settles into rain. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract "respectfully rebellious" trait, which is more told than shown in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the drones cross paths in a silent vow, with cost legible in the washed-away dust of grudges. The hybrid lens (causal actions within an accumulative atmosphere) holds. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The persistent constraint of the drone border shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("low neon," "cracked floor tiles"). The arcade's circuitry and lights are integrated into the action and mirror internal states. The bottle itself functions as a constraining object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Milo's agency under the hybrid lens, using the bottle to blind the drone and force a moment for truce. The cost is unmistakable as the storm is spent. The dominant stake (fragile peace) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. A slight deduction as the rival pilot's arrival feels slightly convenient, though his nod shows earned recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of healing broken promises by linking absences emerges through events and the final image, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the crossed drone paths and the quiet rain. The core concept integrates seamlessly with theme. Avoids moralizing; the final vow is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("coat flapping like a banner of surrender"). The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. Purposeful compression is used effectively. The voice remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. Rhythm varies naturally with the scene's needs. Minor overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("a thunderstorm in a bottle, the roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise") slightly muddles clarity, triggering a small deduction. Otherwise, no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a disputed territory mailman, a thunderstorm in a bottle, and a smuggling drone border is fresh, specific, and organic. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, not a checklist. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. Risk-taking with the lyric accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
