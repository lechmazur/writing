<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness is a consistent trait that motivates his focused pursuit, and his yearning is effectively transliterated into action. However, the characterization lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate it to the highest band; his internal state is more monolithic than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with clear cost as the echo becomes a "lingering pulse" within him. The lens holds from start to finish, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts escalating pressure toward the final, earned image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and the rusted rail spike are not merely vivid; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The spike is the tool that pierces the veil, and the garden's responsive pulses directly guide the fisher's physical path and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the fisher's agency under the Accumulative lens, following the garden's resonant guidance. The cost is legible as his yearning is transformed into a compass, and the final acquisition of the echo forecloses his initial searching state, reweighting his purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of seeking vs. freeing a divine echo is fully integrated and resolved through the resonant, non-literal final image of casting a net for notes. It offers a complex answer without moralizing, emerging organically from the fisher's specific actions and the garden's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is highly distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually specific texture. Some minor overwriting and figurative density ("midnight flowers that opened only when patterns break themselves") create slight momentum drag, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but figurative language is pervasive, particularly in high-pressure beats. This creates a density that, while often beautiful, occasionally borders on overwriting and slightly obscures clarity, incurring a deduction under the overwriting checks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fisher in a sonic garden seeking a goddess's echo through a rail spike is highly original and feels organic. The lyric risk-taking with dense figurative language largely coheres and heightens the stakes, though some phrases echo a familiar mythic register.</comment>
