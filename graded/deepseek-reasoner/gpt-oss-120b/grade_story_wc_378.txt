<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vira's nostalgia and inner static are embodied through specific actions (whispering ancient code, placing the box among seedlings) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice to integrate the box with the earth is earned by prior causality, showing a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost—the sacrifice of her perpetual vigilance for peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds: the magnetic shift triggers a causal chain, while the resolution is an accumulative reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Vira achieves "fragmented wholeness," with cost legible in the burning away of her static and the box's integration into the soil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm are not just backdrop; they pressure the action (flickering shielding, controlled burn) and charge the final image. The box's organic nature constrains Vira's method, and the setting's details (ozone scent, molten sky) are filtered through her sensor-based perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Vira's agency under the Hybrid lens: she chooses to miniaturize the chaos, narrowing her options and forcing the controlled burn. The cost is unmistakable—the loss of her "perpetual vigilance"—and the pressure coheres from the magnetic shift to the final integration of the box.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between machine and earth emerges organically through the box's transformation and the roses' reorientation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing; the final image of the box intertwining with the vine is a powerful conceptual repricing of fear into hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Vira's android senses (glinting titanium, tasting ozone). The voice modulates beautifully under pressure, and the lyrical compression ("stars scattering like fractured glass") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("like origami," "like fractured glass") is purposeful and coherent. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the scene's tempo, from the throbbing dome to the quiet hiss of containment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, organic box, and magnetic shift is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of miniaturizing chaos is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, committing fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
