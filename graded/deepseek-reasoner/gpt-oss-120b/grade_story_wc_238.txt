<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, flawed history. Embodied emotion is strong ("feeling the weight of that ash"), and the final choice to send the apology is a credible endurance. Minor deduction for a slight drift into abstract language in the peak beat ("authenticity of a cracked saint").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant Charged Poise with clear cost (the falling trees, the lingering apology). Orientation is swift and purposeful. The mechanics of the "induced currents" are slightly ambiguous but serve the lyric pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and doomed orchard are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and charge the action. The piano and perfume bottle function as micro-settings that shape the protagonist's choices. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the accumulative pressure of the looming orchard's destruction and the ritual's intensity. The protagonist's agency—arranging the pages, whispering the verse—drives the escalation. The cost is felt in the final image of the falling trees and the lingering, imperfect apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect forgiveness emerges entirely through concrete action and image (the broken mirror metaphor, the torn pages, the cracked saint). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "imperfect miracles" is fully integrated into the story's texture and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical voice. The prose is controlled and purposeful, though the density of metaphor in high-pressure beats creates a slight momentum drag. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from minor overwriting. Figurative language is occasionally stacked ("turning the sheet music into a living map of regret... ghostly fingers"), creating a muddle that slightly obscures clarity. Rhythm is generally strong, but these artifacts prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of gossip columnist and exorcist is fresh and organic, not a gimmick. The core premise is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded details. The lyric, accumulative structure is a bold risk that pays off, heightening stakes and meaning.</comment>
