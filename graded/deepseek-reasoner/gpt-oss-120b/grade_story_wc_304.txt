<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with "lucidly watchful" demonstrated through action. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (leaving the chip as a beacon) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with cost ("the aurora dimmed a fraction"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation driven by pattern density and a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are not merely descriptive; they actively pressure the choice by providing the dwindling resource (the aurora's spark) and constrain the action. The moonstone slab and emerald chip function as micro-settings that charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—the act of infusion is a meaningful tightening that forecloses other options. The cost is legible in the aurora's dimming, a visible price paid for the captured spark.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving light against oblivion. Theme emerges organically from the infusion act and the final image of the chip as a beacon, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently lucid and reverent, with purposeful compression ("radiant hush") that is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, though minor repetition occurs ("lucidly watchful" appears twice). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, with no muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of beauty, death, and cosmic preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of "beautician mortician" and "threshold of stillness" is a fresh, organic angle on familiar themes of legacy and light.</comment>
