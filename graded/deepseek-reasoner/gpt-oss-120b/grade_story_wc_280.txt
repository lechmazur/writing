<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost's yearning is palpable and embodied, driving the narrative. His synesthesia ("rusted brass and liquid violet") is a character-specific filter, not a label. However, the final choice to amplify the echoes feels more like a culmination of his established desire than a contradictory impulse tested under new pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing with clear cost: the ghost's essence expands as he finds peace, leaving a promise. The accumulative lens holds. A minor causality break occurs with the shopkeeper's sudden, un-motivated arrival and immediate understanding, which slightly undermines the earned nature of the finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The mystic orchard is not a postcard but an active participant, its apples bursting into luminous notes that are integral to the climax. The environment decisively constrains and enables the ghost's final action, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (a final encore) are clear. Escalation is driven by the ghost's agency in singing and amplifying echoes, creating a coherent, textural intensification under the accumulative lens. The cost—his expansion and peaceful dissolution—is legible. The shopkeeper's coincidental arrival complicates but does not resolve the core conflict, which is handled by the ghost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the union of performance, memory, and hope. The final image of apples falling like "soft applause" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a poignant conceptual repricing of what an encore can be.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a synesthetic, lyrical texture ("chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet") that remains controlled under pressure. The prose's rhythmic quality supports the accumulative drive. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly figurative but purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. It maintains momentum and clarity even at peak density. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("synesthetically blessed") appears early but is quickly subsumed by concrete, embodied description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, a tarot coin, and a mystic orchard feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is committed to fully and executed with high emotional specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk of highly lyrical prose pays off by heightening stakes and coherence.</comment>
