<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the half truths... settle like dust on her palm") and a clear, consistent motivation. Her affectionate detachment is a credible flaw that flavors her micro-choices, and her final renunciation (Earned Stasis) is earned by the scene's causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through sensory density and a cadence shift at the chime. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's composed satisfaction crystallizes her role; cost is legible in the grotto's lingering "whisper of static" and her immediate return to commerce.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amber grotto is an indispensable, tactile setting that actively pressures the choice by supplying the static charge. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the environment ("walls humming") and key object (petal) directly constraining the process and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through sensory density and the culminating chime. The dominant stake (creating a sellable emotion) is clear, and the cost of her detached trade is felt in the final image, though the pressure is more atmospheric than actively complicating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>The theme of synthetic empathy emerges organically from the core concept of "half truths," resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the premise through the juxtaposition of Mara's "comfortable cloak" of detachment against the city's "craving."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a controlled, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure ("faint crackle grew louder"). The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, and any elision (the chemist's backstory) is purposeful and paid off in the present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("affectionate detachment flavored her movements"), which uses a near-abstract label, but the sentence-level propulsion and clarity remain excellent, and no artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of emotion dealing is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis executed with high conceptual integrity. The combination of a counterfeit dealer, a fragrance petal, and static electricity as a sensing method feels organic and singular, fully committing to its implications without retreat.</comment>
