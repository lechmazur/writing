<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The queen's disenchantment and motivation are embodied and concrete, driving the narrative forward. Her internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure are credible, particularly her vow and final interaction with the orb. The retinue, however, lacks individuation, functioning more as a collective shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens fits best, with pressure building through dense imagery and a decisive cadence shift at the orb. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the queen is tempered by starlight, with cost legible in her vow to watch over the ridge. Causality is tight and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ember grotto and cobalt setting are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment pulses and exhales, directly shaping the queen's actions and the story's climax. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the queen's agency under the accumulative lens, moving her deeper into the grotto. The dominant stake (unraveling the dream) tightens meaningfully, culminating in a choice with a clear cost—her vow to bind the starlight. A single, sufficient pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the queen's journey from disenchantment to tempered guardianship. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of binding starlight, reweighting the recurring dream from a curse to a map without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture and a controlled perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The patterned elision ("bleeding starlight") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "lacy menace"), though it remains coherent and largely serves the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a disenchanted monarch and a mythic, starlit quest feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "bleeding starlight" is transformed from a decorative phrase into a narrative mechanism with cost, demonstrating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
