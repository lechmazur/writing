<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's involuntary truthfulness is a compelling flaw that drives her choices under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of secrecy for communal good. Her micro-choices, like hiding the eye and speaking the final truth, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final stance feels earned by prior causality, though a minor diagnostic label ("rational") briefly flattens interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the eye's reflective power reconfigures community stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds tightly: Mara's plan and truth-telling directly force the smugglers' silence. The cost is legible in the "fragile safety blooming" and the orchard's transformed purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is indispensable, pressuring choices with its storms and slick bark, and charging the final image as a "storm-kissed" mirror. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional focus on roots and moss. The ravine's "broken cathedral" imagery constrains tactics and deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency: her decision to hide the eye and confront the smugglers narrows options and forces a trade-off between greed and exposure. The dominant stake (psychological safety) tightens meaningfully through her irreversible choice. Cost is felt in the smugglers' silenced greed and the community's fragile new covenant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the eye's reflective power and Mara's truth-turning, resisting moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer about shared pain. The final image of "courage to reflect it together" reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates in the smugglers' masked faces and the orchard's exhale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward fungal and climatic imagery ("mossy roots," "storm-kissed silence"). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, advancing plot through the smugglers' challenge. Minor register drift ("psychological safety") is voice-motivated by Mara's rational trait.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional stacked modifiers ("broken cathedral of fruit") risk slight blurring. Rhythm accelerates with storm surges and breathes in reflective moments. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; clarity remains intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-virus caution, involuntary truth, and a reflective relic feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity in the hanging orchard and glass eye avoids tropiness. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
