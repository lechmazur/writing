<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is clear and consistently drives her micro-choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her handling of the storm glass and whispering counter-tones. The final renunciation—emptying the vial—is an Earned Stasis that feels earned by her prior actions, though the cost could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density and pattern until the final Charged Poise. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the "vaulting hush" settles, reweighting the value of silence. The cost is legible in the spent vial and the passengers carrying the hush within them. The lens holds from midpoint to end without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the POV's perception and actions. The setting's sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's professional priorities. The vial charges the final image, though the terrace itself functions more as atmospheric setting than a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early: to achieve peace through cultivated silence. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift and density increase, culminating in the vial's silver cascade. The protagonist's agency is evident in her continuous monitoring and whispering, which directly leads to the final, charged quiet. The cost is felt but could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding comfort in transit through cultivated silence emerges organically from the particulars of Lira's method and the storm glass. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The recurring motif of the train whistle's echo beautifully reweights the concept of quiet, though the thematic statement "to teach silence how to comfort" is slightly overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality that matches the protagonist's role. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with the emotional intensity of the scene. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fractured lullabies") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("vaulting hush" is used three times). However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The combination of a gondola operator on a singing prism terrace using a storm glass to catalyze calm is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The concept feels organic and fully committed to, not a checklist. The quiet, accumulative structure is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres, supporting the singular artistic stance.</comment>
