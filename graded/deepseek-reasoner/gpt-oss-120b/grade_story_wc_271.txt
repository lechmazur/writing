<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's trauma is embodied through somatic markers and micro-choices (smoothing photo, noting breath) that feel authentic. The "quietly talented" trait lacks visible trade-offs, slightly reducing agency. Final renunciation feels earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final image ("ready to plant her own beacon of hope"). Orientation is immediate; pattern of sensory cues builds cohesively toward stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arboretum actively constrains choices (bench, cliff edge) and charges the final image. Sensory details (pine needle, wind chimes) are filtered through POV and serve thematic resonance. Spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative sensory cues under the textural lens. Dominant stake (anchoring optimism) tightens through somatic practices. Cost is legible in the photo-handling beat, though pressure remains internal rather than externally forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through recurring images (pearl, photograph) without moralizing. Final line offers a non-literal answer to loss and hope. Subtext operates in gestures (smoothed photo, whispered promise) and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical voice is consistent and distinct, with perceptual signature ("salt of the wind," "frayed like the coastline"). POV stability maintained; elision (e.g., partner's details) feels purposeful and charged. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, though slightly overwritten in places ("quietly talented gait"). Minor scaffold in repetitive "crumpled photograph" mentions. No artifacts harm closure; final paragraph lands with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery and arboretum setting. Pearl of stillness concept transforms familiar resilience tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical compression pays off without obscuring clarity. Premise feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
