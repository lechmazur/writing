<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and rooted in loss, driving higher-stakes choices. Her emotional progression from grief to trust is embodied and credible, though some interiority edges toward summary ("she learned to trust again"). The final renunciation of erasure for layering is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—"the attic bloom and wither in a single breath." The paper trails and meteorite chip interweave to create a decisive conceptual repricing of memory. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic setting is indispensable, constraining choice through the skylight and dust motes while charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust turned to gold"). The meteorite chip and parchment maps function as micro-settings that shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving lost songs) escalates through accumulative density of paper trails and pigeon flights, driven by Lila's agency. Cost is legible in the transformation of personal and planetary history. One meaningful tightening occurs as the map pulses "like a living heart."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions—dust, pigeons, meteorite—avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new." Subtext operates in the humming chip and returned chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("withering grace"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Some sentences are densely figurative but remain legible. No dialogue present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("bloom with a withering grace") slightly muddles clarity but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Information density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon training, meteorite lore, and dust mapping feels inevitable. The concept commits fully, and the emotional specificity avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
