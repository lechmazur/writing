<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("analytically intuitive"), with a credible transformation from destroyer to preserver. The final choice to portray the story is earned by prior causality, though the emotional shift from "volcanic tenderness" to fierce love feels slightly rapid, lacking a micro-choice to fully bridge the contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage under the inferred Causal lens: the fire reveals the portrait, which forms a map to the art trail, culminating in the scroll's discovery. Closure is a decisive change (becoming a guardian) with a visible cost—the relinquishment of his destructive past—legible in the final mural of himself reborn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("hollow basalt dome," "dust danced like ash"), filtered through the POV's analytical intuition. The setting pressures choice (the archive contains the clues), but the environment does not decisively constrain a pivotal choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the controlled blaze reveals the map, and each discovered artwork narrows options toward the final niche. Cost is legible in the transformation of his purpose and tools—fire from destructive to illuminative—though the price of his three-year absence remains implied, not felt on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly from the integration of fire, art, and memory, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the phoenix and the promise "to protect the stories," reweighting the arsonist's past actions without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading the silent equations of color and pattern as if they were equations of fire") with consistent POV and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision (e.g., the three years off-grid) is paid off by the closure's focus on redemption, not backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though minor artifacts appear: "volcanic tenderness" is a slightly mixed metaphor, and "analytically intuitive" risks label-speak. No loops or scaffold; momentum remains strong through to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of arsonist and archivist tropes through specific, grounded choices. The core premise—fire as illumination rather than destruction—feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
