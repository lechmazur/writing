<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand "the shape of home" is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific sense of displacement. Her actions align with this motive, particularly the nightly use of the stone and the final, decisive act of placing it back on the pedestal. The final choice feels earned, though the emotional cost of her renunciation could be more sharply embodied on the page in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with escalation achieved through increasing sensory and emotional density. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lira's understanding of home shifts from a fixed place to an internal resonance, foreclosing her search with a visible cost of relinquishing the stone. The cost is legible in the line "feeling the mountain’s heartbeat slow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely decorative but a crucible that pressures Lira's choices and charges the final image. The mountain bookstore, the stone, and the feather are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable her progression. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and deeply integrated into the POV's perception and actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the hum unfurling a new corridor—that reweights the dominant stake. Lira's agency in pressing the feather deeper and opening the book drives the climax. The cost of her newfound understanding is the renunciation of the stone itself, which is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of home as an internal resonance emerges organically from the specific particulars of the stone, the feather, and the final book. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of "home" is earned through Lira's struggle and the story's accumulated imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's distinctive, metallic perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic variation. Purposeful compression and elision, such as the taught pattern of the stone's use, are paid off cleanly at closure without obscuring meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting occurs in the peak beat: "the pages unfolded not with ink but with the very scent of home—pine, rain, and the distant echo of her mother’s lullaby." The stacked sensory claims slightly risk abstraction but are rescued by their concrete particulars and connection to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a seer in a mountain bookstore using a feather to read a feeling-map is a fresh, non-obvious, and highly specific concept. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed through to a coherent and inevitable conclusion. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
