<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The boy's motivation is clear and rooted in his inherited stigma and maternal loss. His micro-choices, like following the pulsing lattice and whispering the tale, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his internal conflict and contradictory impulses under peak stress are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the boy's stance crystallizes into a guide, with cost felt in the cold salt searing his feet. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation via pattern breaks (lattice pulsing, corridor breathing) that reweight the stake. The final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice (narrow ledge, slick rocks) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the boy's POV, with the lattice and copperlight acting as recurring objects that evolve with the action. Spatial choreography is coherent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the lattice pulse and breathing corridor) that reweights the dominant stake of redemption. The boy's agency in following the path and whispering the tale forces a stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the final image, though the escalation's intensity is slightly muted by the prose's density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transformation of warnings into guiding threads, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the bodies rising in grateful silence. The lattice and the boy's inherited legend are particulars that charge the thematic resonance without becoming allegorical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a consistent perceptual signature. However, some syntactic patterns become repetitive (e.g., "copperlight repose"), and the voice convergence in the final paragraphs, while intentional, slightly flattens the distinct POV under emotional pressure. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from minor text artifacts. A template-cadence run occurs with "The hush was a promise... The hush answered..." and a paraphrase loop exists in the description of the narrow door. These minor scaffold issues and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats prevent a higher score, though clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "cry wolf" narrative with a gothic, magical realist lighthouse setting feels fresh and organic. The concept is committed to fully, with the lattice's impossibilities and the boy's motivation woven deeply into the story's logic. The specific, verifiable detail (salt-seared feet, carved lattice) creates authenticity without quirk.</comment>
