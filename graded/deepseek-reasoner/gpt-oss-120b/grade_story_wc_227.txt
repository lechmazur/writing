<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, shown through concrete micro-choices like aligning the charm with the statue's fissure. Interiority is specific and embodied ("heart throbbed like a clock-gear"), though contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous than sequential. The final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in the merging of sea's bite and workshop's pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where narrative intention reconfigures meaning against the void. Cost is legible in the "acid sea's roar muffled" and the workshop's gears humming "a lullaby of redemption." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the pattern of repair through narration is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on acid sea pressures every action ("acid sea below churned, trying to dissolve the workshop’s foundations"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias, with the statue's pockmarks and corrosive mist shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with narration deepening stakes against the corrosive void. Cost is legible in the "weight of each breath" and the sea's ceasefire. One meaningful cadence shift occurs as the narrative bulwark strengthens, though pressure could tighten more sharply mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through kintsugi imagery and narrative repair, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "each crack holds the promise of a golden line." Subtext operates in gesture and image, though the final stanza edges toward explicit theme statement without full abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptually signature voice ("sky of bubbling acid," "heart throbbed like a clock-gear"). Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though some register elevation occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information density and varied sentence openings. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("narrative grew stronger, a bulwark of purpose against the void") slightly muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is generally coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of kintsugi philosophy with narrative repair feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail ("tarnished by years of sea-salt and secret oaths") anchors universals, avoiding template plots.</comment>
