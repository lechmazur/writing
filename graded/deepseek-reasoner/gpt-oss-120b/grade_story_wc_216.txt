<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" is concrete and embodied, driving her actions with credible urgency. Her micro-choices, like placing the urn fragment, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, her internal contradiction and emotional degradation under stress are underdeveloped, keeping the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through pattern breaks and cadence shifts. The closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing where time's meaning is reconfigured with undeniable cost, felt in the final image of villagers leaving with notes. Causality is tight, and the orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo and the urn fragment are not merely described; they actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The setting is a character in itself, with sensory details filtered through Mara's professional bias and integrated into the action. The silo's transformation into a "giant antenna" is a powerful, specific constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, moving from observation to active discovery. The dominant stake (understanding time) tightens meaningfully with each find, culminating in a closure that reweights the valley's entire existence. The cost—the transformation of time into the "weight of decisions"—is legible and profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of mending broken time through shared stories emerges organically from the particulars of the plot and the final, resonant image. It offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated, and the emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, purposeful rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perception. A slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats prevents a higher score, but the voice is coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, figurative language becomes dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "time passing itself... thin silk"), creating minor coherence issues that slightly obscure clarity. This is a hairline slip that prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar concepts (time capsule, post-apocalyptic setting) into a wholly original and inevitable-feeling whole. The specific, grounded choice to use garage sale ads as a cipher is a fresh, non-obvious angle that is integral to the plot. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off brilliantly.</comment>
