<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Selene's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific worldview. Her "uncommonly serene" demeanor is embodied through action, not just labeled. The final choice—a renunciation of control—is earned by the preceding epiphany, though the cost of this new approach remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her stance crystallizes. The cost is felt conceptually but lacks a concrete, on-page anchor; the final promise is more potential than paid price, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Its parabolic dishes "turned inward" are a masterful image that pressures the thematic core. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The pressure coheres through increasing textual density leading to the epiphany. However, the escalation is more internal and reflective than actively pressured by the environment, capping the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling emerges organically from concrete particulars—the puppets, the stick, the dome. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A slight deduction for the term "half-lit epiphany" nearing thematic echo in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with the emotional intensity of the climax. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful but shows minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "strings of conscience unspooling from the puppets' wrists like ribbons of starlight"). This figurative stack slightly muzzles the closure's clarity, though momentum and rhythm are otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a calligrapher in a radar dome exploring ethical narrative through puppetry is a singular, non-obvious concept. It feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the theme.</comment>
