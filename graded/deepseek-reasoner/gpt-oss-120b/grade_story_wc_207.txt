<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is concrete and particular, with her obsession and profession deeply integrated into her actions. Her final choice to step onto the water is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The "sensibly eccentric" trait is more a label than an active constraint, slightly limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) that lands on the page with clear cost ("the explanations she chased dissolved"). The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through sensory density and cadence shifts toward a decisive realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon and limestone cliffs actively pressure Mara’s choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, though a slight over-reliance on visual description in the lagoon passage prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift as the water staircase forms. The cost of surrender is legible on the page, though the stakes transition from a tangible object (compass) to a conceptual state slightly softens the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of surrender to the inexplicable emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final realization reweights prior material without moralizing, and the concept of "hinged awakenings" is fully integrated into the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is highly specific and purposefully compressed, with any elision taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though minor figurative stacking ("resonant hush," "liquid glass") in peak beats creates a slight decorative effect. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and there are no loops or scaffold artifacts to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of petrichor collection, psychometry, and subterranean exploration feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "hinged awakenings" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
