<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marek's motivation to bottle safety is clear and consistent, rooted in childhood memory. His ritualistic actions are character-particular micro-choices that reveal his values under pressure. The final choice to protect the chain feels earned, though the internal contradiction between sea's dual nature (crush/cradle) could be more actively dramatized in the moment rather than stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the stone spiral's pulse reweights the space from haunted to sanctuary. Cost is legible in the "luminescent ache" and the reconfigured silence. The ritual's progression builds density that charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the finale. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (wind's sigh, glass tremor, cold stone), filtered through Marek's professional familiarity. The environment evolves from cold silence to luminescent ache, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional safety vs. desolation) escalate through the accumulative ritual, each stone adding density that reweights the dominant stake. Agency is clear in Marek's deliberate actions, culminating in a visible price: the transformation of the room and his internal state. The sea glass's warmth and the spiral's pulse provide felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ritual's particulars—safety as a bottled, shared feeling—resisting moralizing. The final image (glowing stones, carried talisman) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how hope endures in darkness. Subtext operates powerfully in the whispered messages and repurposed silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant") that colors every description. Lyric compression is purposeful and taught early; the voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. No dialogue, but internal voice remains concrete and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without artifice. Sentences propel the accumulative rhythm ("stacking smooth river stones in a precise spiral"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; closure image is sharp and earned. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally with the scene's emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual, sea glass, and anonymous letters feels fresh and inevitable. The haunted-lighthouse trope is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character action and symbolic weight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is singular.</comment>
