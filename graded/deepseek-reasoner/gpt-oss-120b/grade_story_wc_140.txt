<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final purpose is earned, yet the emotional embodiment relies on conceptual phrasing like "texture of memories" rather than raw, irrational struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist becomes a "keeper," with cost legible in the final image of the label as a "promise." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The port setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV, with the labyrinthine containers and tide rhythm constraining movement and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving deeper into the maze and decoding the label. A single meaningful cadence shift occurs with the tide surge, reweighting the stake. Cost is felt in the final commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories and memory emerges organically from the layered fragments and the label's function. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the protagonist as a "living archive."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct, textured rhythm that modulates with pressure. Purposeful elision and compression are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "texture of memories" is repeated, creating a slight conceptual loop. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellently maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a death-certificate survivor, a mystical poison label, and accumulative historiography is highly original and feels inevitable. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle, executed with full commitment to its implications.</comment>
