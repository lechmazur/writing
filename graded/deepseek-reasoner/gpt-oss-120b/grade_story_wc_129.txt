<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to "graft herself onto community" is clear and drives the narrative. Her "boldly sympathetic" nature is shown through her perception of the orchard's sorrow, though this trait could be more embodied in a moment of micro-choice under pressure. The final choice to dedicate the arbor is earned, but the internal cost of this commitment could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of the glowing tapestry reconfigures the space into a sanctuary. Cost is legible in the orchard's "sigh" and the "fragile, beautiful duty" it imposes. The shared search provides a coherent structure that accumulates meaning toward this final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and glimmering obsidian arbor are not merely described; they actively pressure the characters' choices and charge the final image. The arbor's fractured light "stitch[es] the ground," and the reeds "crack" underfoot, integrating setting with action. The environment is a crucial, constraining character in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of the shared search and the cadence shift at the pillar. The dominant stake of connection is signaled early and meaningfully deepens when the glyph is found, reweighting the community's purpose. The cost of this new duty is felt in the final paragraphs, charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from the particulars of the search, the arbor, and the woven reeds. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection. The concept of "webs of kinship" is fully integrated into the narrative's action and closure, avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality. The prose has a strong rhythmic control, though some sentences are complex and risk slight opacity. The perceptual signature is consistent, filtering the world through Arlen's sympathetic and artistic sensibility. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is richly textured and generally purposeful, though a tendency toward dense figurative language ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") creates minor moments of overwriting that slightly slow momentum. The closing paragraphs are strong, with clear propulsion and a powerful final image. No major loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of a marsh-reed sculptor, a glimmering obsidian arbor, and a search for a street artist's tag is a highly original and specific synthesis. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its poetic, accumulative premise. The setting and central metaphor are fresh and memorable.</comment>
