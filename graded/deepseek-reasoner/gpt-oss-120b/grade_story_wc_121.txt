<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion. The final choice to embrace fractured selves is earned by prior causality, though the motivation's abstract nature ("conquer the labyrinth of self") slightly limits its visceral punch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing, landing on the page with undeniable cost as the tablet dissolves. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, building pressure through density and cadence shifts that culminate in the final, decisive image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the viaduct and rain creating a potent atmosphere. It charges the final image but falls just short of actively constraining a choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear, felt cost as he pledges to carry his fractured selves. The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the procedural generation of his past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of integrating one's fractured selves emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final realization reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature. Minor instances of ornate diction ("periodically eternal") create slight register drift in peak beats, but the POV remains stable and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle exists ("darkening brightness that seemed to swallow the lingering mist") and a template cadence emerges in a few adjacent sentences, slightly dulling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravity-defier, procedural generation, and a metaphysical labyrinth of self is a highly original, non-obvious concept. It feels inevitable in hindsight and the risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
