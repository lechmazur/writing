<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, poetic worldview ("to discover what trees witness"). His actions are consistent, and his emotional progression from quantified sorrow to gentle relief is embodied and earned through the on-page action with the sextant. A minor deduction for a slight abstraction in the phrase "quantified sorrow" which edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it is quickly grounded in the grid's physical humming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) achieved through a clear, accumulative/textural lens. The cost is legible on the page as the quantified sorrow lifts and is replaced by a calm that heals. The lens holds perfectly from the initial task through to the final, quiet image of the world breathing in relief. The persistent constraint of the grid's sorrow shapes his tactics from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and the sextant itself function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Eli's choices. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through his professional perspective. The recurring object (sextant) charges the final image and the environment (the ancient oak) is integral to his motivation and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative/textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift and density increase as Eli maps the dreams, reweighting the dominant stake of sorrow into peace. The cost is visible as the sorrow dims and the filaments are released. Agency is clear, though the escalation is more a deepening of a single action than a series of tightening turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of transforming measurable grief into peace emerges organically from the specific actions and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the labyrinth's future being "bright." The concept of "mundane miracles" is fully integrated and avoids moralizing, earning its emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a consistent perceptual signature. The voice modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the moment. There is no head-hopping, and the controlled elision (e.g., the specifics of the folklore) serves the accumulative pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "quantified sorrow" is repeated and risks feeling slightly abstract or label-like before being embodied. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a top-tier score. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity are otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a labyrinth worker, quantified sorrow, and a broken sextant that maps dreams is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
