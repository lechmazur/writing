<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's curiosity is consistently embodied through tactile interactions (kneeling, inhaling spores) and drives all key choices. The final pattern-making act feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the receding water revealing frozen saplings. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated reflection ("when habits break...") but interiority remains concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly: pattern-breaking (constellations, mushroom arrangement) escalates through density increases that reweight the stake of lost memory. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the realigned patterns physically transform the environment, with cost legible in the unveiled saplings and amber-lit scene. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the shipwreck circle and sunken orchard directly constrain movement and enable the mapping ritual. The greenhouse environment charges the finale by revealing the saplings, and sensory details (brine, sugar-and-salt air) are purposefully filtered through the folklorist's expertise. Spatial choreography is coherent across hulls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency: her studying of constellations and rearrangement of mushroom caps creates a decisive intensification that reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable as water recedes and saplings emerge, foreclosing the path of loss. No coincidental resolution; all turns arise from her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, loss, and pattern-making, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer via the reclaimed orchard and songs, with lingering ambiguity about the sea's dual nature. Minor deduction for near-thematic echo in "when habits break" reflection, though it remains grounded in character memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature biased toward mythic detection. Diction remains within the folklorist's lexicon ("mythic energy," "memory currents"). Minor rhythmic flatness in mid-paragraph sentences, but no head-hopping or register drift. Elision (e.g., exact mechanics of memory recovery) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "Each rusted mast pointed toward a fragment of a story"). Minor template cadence in consecutive "Each..." sentences and a slight filter-verb stack ("she realized," "she felt") in the climax, but clarity remains uncompromised. No mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maritime wreckage, botanical mythology, and memory work feels fresh and inevitable. The fairy ring mushroom as a navigational tool is transformative. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in constellations and fungal networks avoids quirkiness.</comment>
