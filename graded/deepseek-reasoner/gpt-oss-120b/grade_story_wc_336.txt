<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pruner's reverence and creative drive are clear and embodied, compelling his high-stakes choices. His insatiable creativity is shown through action, not told. However, his internal state lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his devotion is largely one-note, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchard becomes a bridge between worlds, with cost felt in the pruner's enduring vow. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and image. A minor causality break occurs when the storm's resolution via song feels slightly under-motivated compared to the seed's established mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choices. The waterfall's mist is used to germinate the seed, and the parapet provides the stage for the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, filtering through the pruner's reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the pruner's agency under the accumulative lens: his vow, nurturing the seed, and facing the storm. Each action deepens the stakes and narrows his path, with cost legible in his continued devotion. The dominant stake of preserving wonder is tested and transformed credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder emerges organically from the specific action of nurturing the seed and weathering the storm. The final image of the traveler offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and image, such as the seed's glow painting the leaves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the beats. Some register drift into elevated diction occurs in peak beats ("liquid amber," "radiant hush"), slightly distancing the narrative from the pruner's grounded perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density. However, figurative language is pervasive, occasionally bordering on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "mist like liquid amber," "radiant hush"). This creates minor moments of opacity that slightly dull the closure image, though momentum is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of weaving between worlds is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The combination of a humble pruner and a mythic seed feels organic and fresh. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative premise, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
