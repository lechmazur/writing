<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation ("to interpret silence with empathy") is clear, consistent, and compels every action. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in micro-choices like aligning the projector and tracing glyphs. The final renunciation—choosing to record the moment for future framers rather than claim personal discovery—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (foreclosing personal glory for communal dialogue).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early and held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the chapel becomes "alive with a muted chorus," reconfiguring the boundary between known/unknown with undeniable conceptual cost. The cost is legible in the final image of the "soft glow" and the protagonist's choice to record, not possess, the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The rain-scoured vault pressures the action (drumming rain a "reminder"), the projector is a tool that enables the key method, and the ancient henge's alignment "rewrites the boundary." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's professional bias ("fissure in the map," "ragged paper like a wound").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her methodical comparison of footage and final alignment of the projector constitute a decisive intensification that reweights the dominant stake (interpreting the divide). The cost is felt in the final choice to continue the generational dialogue, foreclosing a path of solitary discovery. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: empathy as a tool to rewrite borders. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "muted chorus," reweighting the prior material (the map's tear as a portal, not a flaw) without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the juxtaposition of silent footage and the protagonist's shielded openness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, methodical voice that modulates under pressure ("notebook tucked under a trembling arm"). The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, with purposeful elision (the community's grief is implied, not explained). No dialogue is present, so those criteria are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("pallid white drizzle," "stone echo on the hill") that, while voice-motivated, slightly blur sense. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion is strong and supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, empathy, and liminal space is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on interpreting history and silence. Bold risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with impeccable integrity.</comment>
