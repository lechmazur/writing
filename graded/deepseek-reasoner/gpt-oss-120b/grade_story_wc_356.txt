<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's ambition is clear and drives the narrative, but her internal conflict is underdeveloped. She shows no contradictory impulses or flaws that complicate her choices; her determination is singular and unwavering. The final earned stasis is credible but lacks a visible, felt cost of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative lens, achieved through the flower's bloom and the village's changed practice. The cost is legible in the final image of the villagers breathing in the new serenity. The lens holds, though the "tide's thought" timeframe is an underutilized anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly rendered and functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. The hollowed birch trunk and the recurring scent notes are purposefully integrated, constraining Lira's actions and shaping the atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and reflects the POV's herbalist priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is accumulative, building through sensory density and the plant's growth, which reweights the dominant stake of cultivating serenity. The cost is felt in the collective absorption of the flower's "deep truth." However, pressure is largely environmental rather than driven by Lira's active, difficult choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of cultivating serenity within motion is coherent and emerges organically from the specific cultivation of the corpse flower. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration is strong, though the "undercurrent of wisdom" concept borders on thematic echo at points.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong, filtered through Lira's herbalist sensibilities. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "olfactorily sensitive," which feels academic for the established voice, creating minor artifacting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but suffers from minor overwriting. The repeated use of "olfactorily sensitive" is a template cadence artifact. Figurative language is sometimes overstacked, e.g., "like a secret garden suspended in the sky" followed closely by another simile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept of a corpse flower symbolizing serenity is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The treetop village setting and the integration of sensory detail create a singular artistic stance. The risk-taking with lyrical prose largely pays off.</comment>
