<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives the plot; her professional identity as a sensory map maker is integral to her actions. Her final choice to free the crew feels earned by her established desire to uncover truth. However, interiority occasionally leans toward summary in high-pressure beats, with a slight diagnostic quality ("Understanding the weight of that secret").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a decisive change (freeing the crew) with clear, felt cost (the shard's destruction). The plot is tightly structured with a clear because/therefore linkage from motivation to discovery to action. The orientation is immediate and the taught pattern of sensory mapping pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is a character, actively constraining and enabling choice through the shard and the conduit. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully drive the narrative. The repair bay's atmosphere is woven into the action and charges the final image of awakening and warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency with the shard, under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (uncovering the truth) is tested and deepens, leading to a costly, consequential choice. Pressure coheres and tightens through the act of redirecting sensory flows, narrowing options to a final, decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth and liberation emerges organically from the specific events and imagery, particularly the "glass-bottle breath" and scattered shard. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A minor deduction for the near-thematic statement in the final line ("cyclically spontaneous yet eternally purposeful").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of weaving) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifacting penalty for the repeated use of "cyclically spontaneous" which, while thematically relevant, creates a slight template cadence. No loops or scaffold obscure closure; the final image is clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography and multiverse theory is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high originality, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, particular details. The green glass shard is a uniquely irreplaceable element.</comment>
