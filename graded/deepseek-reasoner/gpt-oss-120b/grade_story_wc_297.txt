<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the root-bound imagery. The final choice to step through the portal is earned by the tactile, scar-linking method, though the initial motivation ("purposefully curious") could be more sharply defined under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the beacon ignites, reweighting the stakes with a visible cost—the healing of the hedges symbolizing the fusion of past and future. The pattern of sensory and symbolic density escalates cleanly to this final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and maze topiary are indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's perception and action, making the setting a crucible for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in linking through scars, under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the ground trembling and the hedges healing, a tangible price paid for harnessing collective longing. A single, meaningful deepening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of binding dream to duty emerges organically from the concrete action of mapping scars and igniting the beacon. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of intertwined dreams, avoiding moralizing and growing from prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong, though the dense figurative language occasionally risks register drift in high-pressure beats ("anxious elation rose to a roar"). No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "swirling with the luminous threads of hope"). A -0.6 deduction for figurative density that slightly obscures immediacy, though it does not break closure. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a living labyrinth, eclipsed covenant, and scar-linking method feels fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, avoiding template plots.</comment>
