<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific worldview. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in lines like "the weight of silence settle like dust on their shoulders." The final realization—that their role is to catalyze shifts—is earned by the on-page experiment with the shard. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in "inadvertently profound," though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), achieved through the accumulating pattern of the hush spreading via displaced objects. The cost is legible in the final image of the town's rhythm sanctified, a "slow, warm ember." The structure is taut, with each beat layering pressure toward the final, quiet transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The bay, pier, and houses are not backdrop but active participants—the hush "pulsing" through them. The orris root shard itself functions as a micro-setting that dictates the story's logic. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through the POV's specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—the decision to place the shard and observe the results. The dominant stake (understanding/awakening) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as the hush radiates outward, foreclosing the option of mere observation and forcing a catalytic role. The cost is the enduring weight and responsibility of this new understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action and image of the hush, resisting direct statement. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question of why houses feel alive. The concept of "creeping normality" is fully integrated into the thematic exploration of silence and perception, avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The voice—"a tide that never ceases," "streetlights daydream"—is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The single instance of dialogue from the elderly woman is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext that deepens the theme without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight filter-verb stack ("seemed to shift, pausing as if listening") and a hint of register drift in "inadvertently profound." However, these do not obscure closure, and the final image is crystal clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "creeping normality noticer" and a "shard of hush" is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is executed with full commitment, transforming a familiar trope (magical object) into a vehicle for profound thematic exploration. The risk of a quiet, accumulative plot heightens the stakes and meaning perfectly.</comment>
