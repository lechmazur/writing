<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The servant's motivation is clear and consistent, and his affectionate detachment is a compelling, specific trait. However, the internal contradiction is more stated than dramatized; his feelings remain at a "gentle distance" but we don't see the warring impulse to be consumed, limiting the depth of his micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory and symbolic density. The closure is a valid Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with a felt cost of perpetual seeking. A minor deduction for the slightly convenient discovery of the goggles, which softens the causal linkage of this key turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly rendered and deeply integrated, functioning as both setting and crucible. The frost-etched windows and scattered light are not just decorative; they are the specific mechanics that enable the diary's decryption, directly constraining the protagonist's choices and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a meaningful deepening: the discovery of the diary transforms the servant's quest from a vague promise into a concrete, actionable map. The cost is the enduring weight of his purpose, legible in the final promise whispered to the clouds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of finding joy beneath anguish is masterfully integrated, emerging entirely from the action of unlocking the diary and retrieving the laughter. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the servant's quiet promise, avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the emotional beats. The servant's perceptual signature—noticing "prismatic shards" and a "melodic hum"—is consistent and character-specific, enriching the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("like a frozen lighthouse," "warm sunrise over the cold walls") is purposeful and vivid without becoming muddy or overwhelming. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a frozen spire, a light-based cipher, and a quest for stored laughter feels fresh and organic. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, though the archetype of the solitary seeker in a tower is a familiar one, preventing a higher score.</comment>
