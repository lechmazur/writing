<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's "operatively gentle" presence is a consistent, embodied trait that constrains her approach and enables success. Her internal conflict is shown through the "quiet ache" of the price of redemption, and her final choice to carry the lessons forward is a credible endurance earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic "flawed magnificence of humanity's attempt" at the emotional peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (swords laid down, pact made) with a resonant reconfiguration (the terrace as a "living altar"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through the ritual's density and the celestial imagery. The cost is legible in Lira's "quiet ache" and the tangible forfeiture of weapons.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and celestial bodies are not just backdrop; they actively pressure the choice ("bind the warring clans... to honor the slow rhythm of the stars"). The ebony clipboard and the altar are key objects that constrain action and charge the final image of reconciliation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from ritual to resolution. The stake (peace) is signaled early and tightens through the chieftain's bow and the laying down of swords, a meaningful deepening with a visible cost. The pressure remains coherent until the final act reweights the options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and the final image of the clipboard as a "canvas for the silver light of reconciliation." The "price of redemption" is explored not as an abstraction but through the concrete, costly act of laying down swords. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's perception. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "flawed magnificence of humanity's attempt," which feels slightly outside the immediate POV lexicon at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, there is a minor instance of figurative stacking in the high-pressure beat describing the night ("flawed beauty," "amber glow fighting," "silver hush"), which slightly mutes the clarity of the closure image. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a peace negotiation with a celestial ritual feels fresh and organic. The concept is fully committed to, and the specific details (ebony clipboard, operatively gentle negotiator) are irreplaceable, transforming a familiar trope. The final reconfiguration is earned and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
