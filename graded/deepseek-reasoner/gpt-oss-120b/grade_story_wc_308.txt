<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Embodied emotions and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, particularly when she "inhaled deeply, letting the wave guide her thoughts." The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her weathered resolve settling into marrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern density increasing through echoes, birds, and pulse. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, reconfiguring her relationship to motion with cost felt in "weathered resolve." Minor deduction for late introduction of birds as method, slightly straining pattern cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action, with sensory details like "pressure wave that brushed against her skin" filtering through POV. The towers of bone and canyon constrain choice and charge the final image, though tactile interaction with the bone spires could be more specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through layered echoes and bird patterns. Cost is legible in her renunciation of physical navigation, foreclosing that path. The pulse's alignment with birds creates a meaningful deepening that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, with the final reconfiguration offering a resonant, non-literal answer to navigation and stillness. Subtext operates in the birds' patterns and the arrowhead's song, avoiding moralizing. The ending's conceptual repricing charges prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with consistent POV and purposeful compression. Voice is character-specific, with diction like "harmonic stone skimmer" and "weathered resolve" reinforcing tone. Elision is taught and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, no loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional, e.g., "birds' wings cutting the thin air like knives." Syntax varies purposefully with emotional intensity, though minor register drift occurs in "wander between shadow and stone."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (canyon, echoes, navigation) feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The pulse concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character perception and constraint.</comment>
