<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply integrated, with her lineage and profession informing her compassionate, determined actions. Her internal conflict is embodied in her graceful alertness and the tactile graft ritual, culminating in an earned Charged Poise closure where her resolve reconfigures her relationship to her past. The final image of her scarred hands tracing the thread is a potent, cost-bearing micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through sensory density and symbolic weight until the final resonant reconfiguration. The closure is a clear Charged Poise, legible in the coin's song and the villagers' gathering, which reweights the premise with a felt cost of inherited legacy. The linkage from graft to closure is coherent and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and enable Mira's central action, the graft, and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional and personal lens, with the setting's "memory of fire" directly mirroring and pressuring her internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, stakes escalate through a single, decisive intensification: the careful graft and its resultant song. This act, driven by Mira's agency, reweights the dominant stake of legacy and peace, foreclosing the path of blame with a visible cost—the vulnerability of her hope and the weight of her lineage. The pressure is coherent and culminates in the villagers' shifted stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming inherited pain into compassion emerges organically from the graft's success and the final image of the singing scar. It is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the plot and character, avoiding abstraction through concrete, earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's consciousness, with syntax and rhythm reflecting her state. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the graft's mechanics) are taught and pay off at closure without causing disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, a tendency toward overwriting and occasional register drift ("kelp-drift peace," "narrated stories of fire and water") creates minor artifacts that slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats, though they do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an arsonist's daughter firefighter performing a ritual graft on a volcanic sand lagoon is a highly original, non-obvious premise executed with authenticity and bold risk-taking. The combination feels organic and inevitable, transforming potential tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
