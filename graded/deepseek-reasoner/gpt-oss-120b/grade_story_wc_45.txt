<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her "forgiving skepticism" embodied in her actions. Her final choice to create "constellations of hope" is earned by prior causality, though the moment of decision lacks a visible micro-choice with cost, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through the tooth's transformation and the garden's exhale, landing with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The lens holds, and the final image of the "gateway" reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The garden and the baby tooth function as micro-settings that powerfully constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception to mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful deepening as the tooth's light spreads. The cost of her endeavor is legible in the "cleft" narrowing and the garden's final "exhale," though the price paid is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transforming error into hope emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer with the final constellation metaphor. The ending avoids moralizing, offering a complex, earned wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's lyrical density is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats (e.g., "embryonic galaxy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "Each click of vertebrae resonated..." and a slight register drift in the climax ("embryonic galaxy"), but these do not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a secret garden, a changeling's tooth, and bone-setting to mend a fractured destiny feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic stance, avoiding template plots.</comment>
