<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit and cartographer's obsession are consistent and drive his on-page choices. His internal conflict between confidence and anxiety is embodied, not labeled. The falcon, as the only other "character," is functional but lacks depth to pressure Elias meaningfully, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: the falcon's return (E) directly triggers the decision to act. Closure is a Charged Poise, crystallizing the risk and pull of discovery as Elias steps onto the ice. The cost of potential failure ("my folly") is legible, though the condensation method's convenience slightly softens the causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered and actively constrain choice, pressuring Elias's departure. The condensation on the window functions as a micro-setting, its pattern directly guiding his route and charging the final image of the journey ahead. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (finding the convergence) are clear. Escalation is driven by the falcon's return providing new information, forcing a decisive choice to depart. The cost of venturing into the deadly cold is felt, though the pressure could be more visceral to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of seeking origins emerges organically from Elias's quest and the concrete imagery of rivers and maps. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a natural map guiding him, avoiding moralizing. The concept of a personal reckoning at the source introduces potent ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, filtered through Elias's dry, professional wit. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. Some complex sentences verge on overwriting in peak beats, slightly hampering propulsion, but the voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and largely effective, but occasional overwriting ("a rusted speck by the lake") and a complex sentence structure create minor drag on momentum. No major artifacts, but the figurative language is sometimes over-stacked, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of a cartographer in a frozen wasteland, using a falcon and condensation patterns as tools, feels fresh and specific. The core concept of a geographical and personal singular convergence is a strong, non-obvious synthesis of internal and external quests.</comment>
