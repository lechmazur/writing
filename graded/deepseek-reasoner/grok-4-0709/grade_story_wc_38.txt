<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific trait of translating code into music and movement. Her calm defiance is embodied, not just stated, particularly in the final dance. A minor deduction for a lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; her resolve is admirably consistent but could benefit from a flicker of internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through the density of journal entries and dance rituals. Closure is a decisive change (liberation) earned by her meticulous work, with clear cost in the line "liberating not just herself, but the trapped echoes of former colleagues." The structure is taut and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae and cracked viewports, creating a potent atmosphere. It pressures her isolation but does not fully constrain her choices; the setting is more a mood piece than an active crucible. This prevents a 9+ score despite the exquisite description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (solitude vs. liberation) are clear. Escalation under the accumulative lens is achieved through the growing journal and her nightly dice-rolling rituals, which tighten the narrative toward the final, successful sequence. The cost of her prolonged isolation is felt, charging the final image of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of encrypting vulnerability into strength is fully integrated and earned, emerging from her specific actions with the journal and dice. The final image of her surfacing, with vulnerabilities "encrypted forever as strength," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara's poetic, code-breaking consciousness. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, noticing the world through the lens of "probabilistic poetry" and "mysterious familiarity." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite and purposeful, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight artifacting in the peak beat: "a pirouette for a vowel shift, a leap for a rhythmic encryption" has a template-cadence feel. The rhythm is otherwise controlled and supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lyrical code-breaker, hangman's dice, and explaining through dance is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core concept is fully committed to and follows its implications to a bold, satisfying conclusion that heightens the stakes.</comment>
