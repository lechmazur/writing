<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to ponder her own spark is earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, the brief diagnostic label "lucidly watchful" in peak beats slightly diminishes immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as Elara ponders her own threshold. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern density increasing to reweight stakes. One meaningful cadence shift occurs at Thorne's release. Cost is legible in the final image of her "steady flame in the hush."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora pressure choices and supply resources (e.g., prismatic light illuminates tools). The emerald chip constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. Spatial choreography is coherent with tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through pattern density increase. The ritual tightens options, forcing a trade-off with visible cost (Thorne's release). Dominant stake (capturing sparks) is signaled early and tested through the ritual's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of defiance against oblivion. Subtext operates in gesture and implication (e.g., "quiet rebellion"). Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars without platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, and syntax reflects the mind's state. Purposeful compression (e.g., "radiant hush") is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor density issue: slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("liquid hush," "fractal beauty") without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of beauty and mortality roles. Specific, verifiable detail (meteor pigments, starfern) creates authenticity. Risk-taking in lyric design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc are inseparable from setting and voice.</comment>
