<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and sensitivity are consistently embodied, driving her choices. Her final realization feels earned through journalizing and the corpse flower's test. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("serenity within motion") that leans toward theme statement rather than embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara embraces flow, costing her prior drive for conquest. Cost is legible in the final journal image becoming a village treasure. One micro-turn (village's shift to adaptation) supports without complicating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village constrains choice through its suspended nature and storms, while the corpse flower's pot charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully olfactory-driven, filtered through Elara's expertise. The setting evolves from fear to hope, mirroring the arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (serenity vs. turmoil) escalate through the flower's bloom and village reaction, testing Elara's resolve. Agency is clear in her choice to breathe in the stench and find purity. Cost is felt in her transformed ambition, though the village's collective shift slightly dilutes protagonist-centric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (serenity within motion) emerges organically through the corpse flower's paradox and journal doodles. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the journal becoming a guide. Minor deduction for near-moralizing in lines like "true strength lies in rooting deep while swaying free."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical, sensory-rich texture. Diction suits an herbalist's perception. No dialogue, so those bullets are waived. Occasional dense metaphors ("shrouded in mists that danced like forgotten secrets") are consistent but risk slight overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, with strong information density. Some overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "olfactorily sensitive nose" is redundant). Minor template cadence in lists of abstract nouns ("power and peace," "fear of the encroaching storms to hopeful adaptation").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of herbalism, corpse flower symbolism, and journalizing ritual. The treetop setting and olfactory focus feel particular. Risks lyricism but maintains coherence. Transformation of tropes (ambitious hero finds peace) through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
