<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's quietly analytic nature and grief for Clara are embodied through specific micro-choices, like his methodical untangling of wires, which reveals his internal conflict between analysis and surrender. His final realization about equilibrium feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his decision to power down the lights and ascend. The emotional progression is realistic and avoids diagnostic label-speak, though the dialogue with "Mort" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the discovery of the snow globe and the methodical untangling of its threads create a clear because/therefore linkage that narrows options and leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands on the page with cost in the final image of the library fading to shadow, and the lens holds without contradiction. The persistent constraint of his analytical nature shapes his tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sunken library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice through its pressure-sealed, eerie silence, forcing the use of robotic arms and focused light. The snow globe is a key object that charges the final image and is integral to the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens; Elias's decision to untangle the threads is a meaningful tightening that narrows his options and reveals new knowledge. The cost is legible on the page in his whispered realization to "Mort" and his final action of powering down the lights, which forecloses his path of endless analysis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of letting go emerges organically from the particulars of the snow globe, the last transmission, and Elias's grief, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about equilibrium and echoes. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, and the note from the "fellow wanderer" deepens the thematic resonance without being overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice has a distinct perceptual signature, with a controlled, analytic rhythm that modulates under pressure. The brief dialogue with "Mort" is natural and goal-driven, though it is minimal. The prose remains consistent and legible, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled by varied syntax, with high information density. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "sophisticated melancholy," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon, but it does not harm closure clarity. There are no loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deep-sea exploration, a historical mystery, and a personal grief arc feels fresh and organic. The snow globe as a clandestine device is a non-obvious angle that transforms familiar tropes. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
