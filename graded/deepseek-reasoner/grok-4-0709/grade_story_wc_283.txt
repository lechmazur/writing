<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eland's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing his hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; his "quiet inspiration" lacks embodied struggle or irrationality, making the final choice feel slightly tidy rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern-building through buttons and echo unscrambling leads to a resonant reconfiguration (cliffs groaning "in release"). Closure lands with conceptual cost—prophecy transformed—though felt cost is subtle. Orientation is clear early, and causality remains tight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber warehouse and cliffs constrain choices (buttons embedded in resin, echo from crevices) and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Eland's expertise. Micro-setting (jar, buttons) functions as environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (doom avoidance) escalates through tremors and pattern-breaking cataloging. Under accumulative lens, density increase (button tales) reweights stakes. Agency is clear, but cost is more conceptual than visceral; closure relies on wisdom-sharing rather than a tangible trade-off.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom versus rigid fate emerges organically through particulars (buttons' stories, echo's tones). Ending offers a non-literal answer—"prophecies were but echoes of choices"—without moralizing. Subtext in objects and silence enriches resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Eland's perceptual signature ("walls of fossilized resin glowed with trapped sunlight"). No dialogue; compression is purposeful and legible. Minor register elevation in peaks but maintains coherence.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts; figurative language serves pattern-building ("constellations in the night"). Final image recharges motifs without obscuring clarity.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of prophecy, time, and shared wisdom through specific elements (amber, buttons, echo). Premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
