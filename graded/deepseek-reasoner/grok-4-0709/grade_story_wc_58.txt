<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a deep-seated need to understand healing. His final, quiet triumph is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing the path of mourning with a visible cost of solitude. The interiority is concrete and character-particular, though a slight tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness ("explaining the absences") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with a felt cost ("wiser in his solitude"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift into the final, wiser realization. The geography of healing is a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shadowed garden is not merely decorative; it functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice by isolating Elias and charges the final image ("lonesome splendor... mirrored his own unending quest"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully reflects the melancholic yet majestic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of understanding. The cost of solitude is legible on the page. Agency is a renunciation of mourning, foreclosing a path. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "explained absences" emerges organically from the core concept and specific action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of the "final rose of autumn" provides a purposeful ambiguity that lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic modulation. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Minor register drift toward the elevated ("geography of healing") is voice-motivated and does not significantly disrupt clarity or immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like the ribs of some ancient, forsaken cathedral") creates a slight momentum drag, preventing a score in the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of writing obituaries for the living is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its lyrical, introspective premise, and the specific combination of elements creates a singular artistic stance that avoids median options.</comment>
