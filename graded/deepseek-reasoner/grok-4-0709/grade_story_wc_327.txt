<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear, deeply rooted, and intensifies under pressure. Copper veins visually embody his connection to the language and the diamond's energy. His quiet articulation is a consistent trait that constrains his method, making his final, successful action feel earned. The final endurance is a credible Earned Stasis, foreclosing personal legacy for a greater preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), achieved through the protagonist's agency in harnessing the diamond and birds. The cost is legible on the page: his veins thrum with residual energy, and the language's death is accepted, its essence transformed. The canyon's eternal song is the undeniable conceptual cost and achievement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story's crucible. The canyon's acoustics, the bone towers, and the tunnel of echoes are not backdrop but active, constraining elements that directly enable the plot's resolution. The flawed diamond functions as a micro-setting, its cracks crucial for amplifying the energy. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully filtered through the protagonist's goal-oriented perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening pressure of the language's extinction and his risky plan. The stakes—preserving essence versus personal doom—are clear and visceral. The cost is unmistakable: the successful transformation carries the tangible, thrumming energy in his veins and the conceptual cost of the spoken form's death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the specific struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the language lives on as translated sound, a direct conceptual repricing of its death. Subtext is rich in the diamond's curse being repurposed and the birds' patterns providing a natural guide, avoiding any moralizing or explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, textured quality that mirrors the story's core concept. POV is stable and deeply embodied in the protagonist's perception. The prose's rhythm modulates effectively with the tension of the ritual in the tunnel. No head-hopping or register drift; the lyrical style is taught early and maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with virtually no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent, pattern-taught, and serves the theme. A minor rhythm hiccup occurs in the climax ("Textures became sounds:...") with a slightly list-like structure, but it's a hairline slip that doesn't obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is otherwise superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dying language, a cursed diamond, echo tunnels, and bird flight patterns is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with impeccable logic and emotional truth. The specific, grounded choices in character and world elevate it beyond a template plot into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
