<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his higher-stakes choice to carve abstract patterns. His internal conflict is embodied in concrete, character-particular actions ("his mind a whirlwind of calm intensity"). The final renunciation of mere inscription for a woven understanding is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A hairline deduction for the slightly elevated "fiercely meditative" descriptor, which is more told than shown in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting grief from a carved stone to a migrating, woven force. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the "woven, poetic storm." The lens holds perfectly from the early pattern-teaching of the migration to the culminating ribbon-and-butterfly map. Linkage is impeccable, with each beat deepening the pattern toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice, forcing a meditative, circular path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional and obsessive POV. The recurring objects (ribbon, butterflies) charge the final image decisively. A minor deduction for the "thundering calm" descriptor, which, while tonally coherent, slightly strains the physical logic of the established setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, his choice to unspool and retrace the ribbon creating a decisive cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is unmistakable in his altered carving and the ghost's fading whisper. Pressure coheres and deepens through the accumulation of pattern and memory, perfectly suiting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective grief emerges organically from the particulars of the ribbon, the migration, and the recalled ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of a "woven, poetic storm," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's guidance and the butterflies' living map. The integration of concept and theme is flawless and deeply affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in phrases like "vines twisted like forgotten promises." The ghost's dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot naturally. The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates effectively with emotional intensity. A single, minor instance of register drift ("fiercely meditative") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silent storm of orange and black," "whirlwind of calm intensity"), which creates a minor muddle. However, the closure image remains crystal clear, and the propulsion never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration to explore collective grief is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully and executed with bold, specific choices that heighten stakes and coherence. The combination is organic and transformative, far exceeding any template or trope.</comment>
