<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, embodied grief ("the weight of a withheld truth"). Her internal conflict is shown through cyclical spontaneous visions, and her final choice to merge universes is earned by prior causality. However, a minor deduction for a moment of diagnostic label-speak ("the burden of silence that had warped her life") in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change: she emerges with "newfound resolve" after a resonant reconfiguration of her brother's sacrifice, with the cost of bearing his secret made legible. The green glass shard provides a persistent constraint that shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is a masterful micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's professional POV ("metallic scents," "vibration underfoot like a ship's thrumming heart"). The setting actively transforms during the redirect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency using the shard to redirect, forcing a series of tightening choices that narrow options and reveal new knowledge. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the truth's "weight crashed over her." The dominant stake is clear and pays off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of truth's burden emerges organically from events and the final image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The brother's revelation provides a non-literal, complex answer to the central question. A slight deduction for the near-thematic echo of "the weight of a withheld truth" in the opening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose is lyrical and voice-motivated, though it occasionally verges on overwriting in high-pressure beats ("cyclically spontaneous visions flashing"). The elision of the multiverse's mechanics is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm, but suffers from minor figurative overload in peak beats ("shadows elongated, and the air thickened with the scent of blooming nightflowers from a world that never was"). A single paraphrase loop ("cyclically spontaneous") triggers a small deduction, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping and multiverse travel is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat, transforming a familiar trope through grounded, character-driven choices and a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
