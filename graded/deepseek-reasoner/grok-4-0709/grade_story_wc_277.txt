<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion ("fingers trembling slightly"). Her motivation to discover hidden truths is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to intervene. Her final renunciation of passive observation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly, with strong because/therefore linkages driving the plot. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she crystallizes her stance to intervene, with cost legible in her resolve to "break their pull." The proof-by-contradiction method provides a coherent, elegant structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting is masterfully integrated, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV ("echoing floor," "stars wheeled in silent judgment"). The rosewood pen nib functions as a micro-setting, actively used and reweighted in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, tightening from observation to active intervention. The dominant stake (protecting family legacy/truth) is signaled early and deepens through her logical deduction. The cost of breaking her silent orbit is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of observation, regret, and truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of breaking orbits. The concept of "orbits of regret" is fully integrated into the narrative's fabric without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that reflects Elara's character. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, with rhythmic variation. The prose has a distinct texture, and any elision (e.g., the journalist's exact words) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight density risk exists in the "orbits" metaphor cluster. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure clarity. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a newsprint heiress, logical proof, and astronomical metaphor feels fresh, inevitable, and highly original. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Bold risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
