<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in trauma and a mischievous virtue. Her final choice to dive is a credible, earned renunciation that forecloses safety with visible cost. However, the "virtuously mischievous" trait is more stated than fully dramatized in the peak pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with a felt cost (the diamonds as redeemed hardship) under a clear causal lens. The quantum promise premise is taught early and pays off cleanly. The only minor slip is the submarine bolt's late introduction, but its retrieval is causally motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the mushroom farm and spore-suit beautifully integrated. The setting pressures the choice to dive. It falls just short of the 9-band because the environment, while evocative, doesn't concretely constrain a key choice beyond supplying the general context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, from receiving messages to volunteering and the dive. The mounting pressure is both physical and metaphorical, culminating in a clear cost/transformation. The stakes are personal and deeply felt throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of alchemizing trauma into wealth is fully integrated and emerges from the core concept and character actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the diamond cascade, reweighting the prior hardship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, wonder-infused quality. There is a minor register drift in the climax ("Translate this into diamonds" feels slightly declarative), but the perceptual signature remains strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive. A -0.6 deduction is applied for moderate overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shadowseam wonder enveloping her like a velvet cloak" during the dive). This creates a slight density issue but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a quantum promise is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of concept and character. The execution is bold and committed, transforming the familiar "trauma into strength" arc into a literal, speculative process that feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
