<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in her backstory, and intensifies through her ritual. Her internal conflict is embodied in the grafting action, and her final endurance is earned with visible cost when the tree sings. The characterization avoids diagnostic speak, showing contradiction through action and perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tree's song reconfigures meaning with felt cost. The lens holds throughout, and the final image of nomads gathering provides clear cost proof. Orientation is anchored early and effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not just descriptive but constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV. The environment actively shapes the ritual and its outcome, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's persistent agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single meaningful deepening as the graft takes hold. The cost is legible when the tree sings, proving her motivation. Pressure coheres and reweights the stake without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grafting action and final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to renewal without moralizing. Subtext operates in the coin and thread, symbolizing repurposed ties. The ending avoids thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic perceptual signature that heightens pressure. POV is stable and deep, with Elara's filtering clear throughout. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and any elision (like the graft's success) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language ("bruised sky," "kelp-drift peace") is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter, arsonist legacy, and grafting ritual feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
