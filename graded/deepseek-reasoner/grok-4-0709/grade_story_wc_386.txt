<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is clear, rooted in her ghost-whisperer identity, and compels her high-stakes choice to expose the injustice. Her method of analyzing dreams shows a unique, character-particular competence balanced with genuine struggle. The final action—weaving the truth carefully—is a credible endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost (the careful weaving to avoid unraveling peace). A slight deduction for the "borrowed starlight" motif feeling slightly more thematic than a fully embodied, contradictory impulse in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently: pressure escalates through the density of dream accounts and the snow globe's amplification, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara understands her mission. Closure lands on the page with cost ("weave it carefully, lest it unravel... fragile peace"). The persistent constraint of the ghosts' silent pleas and the warped snow globe shape her tactics. Orientation is strong, anchoring who, where, and why within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are not just vivid description; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment pressures Elara ("her suit hummed against the cold"), and the key object is the lens for the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional focus ("navigated the narrow tunnels, her breath fogging the visor"). The setting's "borrowed starlight" tone is integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the accumulation of dream patterns and the snow globe's power force a deepening that changes knowledge (the vision of the captain's log). The dominant stake (exposing injustice vs. preserving peace) is signaled early and tightens significantly. The cost of her method—the careful, non-disruptive weaving—is legible on the page and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging purity from corruption emerges through specific events (the mutiny, the snow globe's distortion) and images (the "thawed wonder"), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "salvaged soul" and the method of guided dream sessions. It embraces complexity (exposing truth without blame's sharp edges) and avoids tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("ice whispered secrets," "spectral voices that clung to them like frost"). The prose has a controlled, ethereal texture apt for the tone. The one minor flaw is a slight register drift in the peak beat ("wove truths carefully, revealing them in layers to avoid shattering fragile minds") which edges toward diagnostic summary, slightly dulling the immediacy of the climactic vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control ("where the ice whispered secrets of forgotten voyages"). There is high information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "windows of connection" and "fragile portals" appear close together, and the phrase "borrowed starlight" is repeated. These are minor and don't obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream analysis feels organic and fresh. The core concept of "windows of connection" is transformed through the specific, grounded choice of analyzing cameos in strangers' dreams. The melted snow globe as a central object is a singular, ingenious inflection. The story commits fully to its ethereal, accumulative premise and follows its implications.</comment>
