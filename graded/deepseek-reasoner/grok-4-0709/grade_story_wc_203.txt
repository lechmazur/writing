<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma ("childhood accident"), with interiority shown through embodied perception ("ethereal heaviness"). His observant trait drives the key discovery, and his final action (winding the barrel) is earned. Minor deduction for slightly summary backstory integration, but micro-choices under pressure feel authentic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: Elias's ability motivates investigation, leading to discovery and reversal of the spell. Closure is a decisive change (ghosts freed) with felt cost ("weightless burden lifted"). Orientation is immediate; structure is economical and relentless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and pressures choices ("peeling posters," "distant creak"). The mainspring barrel acts as micro-setting, constraining the climax and charging the finale. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing trapped souls) escalate through Elias's agency—climbing, analyzing dust, manipulating the barrel. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is legible in the ghosts' release and his burden lifting. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (ceiling as concealment, cracks as broken illusions) emerges through image and action, not statement. Ending offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Minor deduction for slightly explicit thematic echo in final line ("fragile threads"), but subtext operates strongly elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct ("skillfully observant eyes," "ethereal heaviness"). No dialogue, but internal narration is cohesive. Purposeful compression in ghost descriptions works. Slight register elevation in peak beats ("luminous wisps") but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax. Minor artifacts: "weightless burden" leans slightly abstract, and "translucent fissures" may briefly muddy clarity. But no loops or scaffolds; figurative language generally serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise (ghost-seeing technician) is fresh synthesis, executed with specificity. Risk-taking in blending supernatural and mechanical pays off. The mainspring barrel as enchanted object feels inevitable, not ornamental. Closure integrates concept fully.</comment>
