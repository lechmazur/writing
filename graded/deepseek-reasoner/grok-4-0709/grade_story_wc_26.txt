<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to confront her past. Her sharp-eyed observation is a consistent trait that drives action, and her final realization that the shadow is her own regret is an earned internal contradiction. The cost of her transformation is felt in the final luminous regret, though the emotional embodiment in that final beat could be slightly more concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the shadow becomes a guardian, reconfiguring the library's hope with a felt cost—Elara's lingering regret. The inferred causal lens holds: her discovery of the footage (because) leads to her understanding and deliberate action (therefore) to bind the shadow. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's image of her changed heart.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is a vivid, purposeful setting that pressures choice—the shadow's drift erodes dream-vaults, forcing Elara's action. The river stone, a micro-setting, constrains the final choice by providing the anchor for the binding ritual. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional perspective as a dusk noticer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: her investigation tightens options, leading to the decisive dream-share protocol. The dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) is tested by the shadow's erosion, and the cost of confronting her own regret is legible. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the specific image of the metamorphosed shadow—hope preserved not by destroying regret but by integrating it. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how hope endures. The ending avoids moralizing, sitting in the complex light of lessons learned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, observant quality fitting a dusk noticer. The prose has a controlled rhythm, though some phrases ("luminous regret," "softly deliberate") risk repetition. Elision is purposeful, with the video comparison method taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but occasional ornate phrasing ("wisps of luminous sorrow") slightly inflates texture without advancing sense. A minor synonym churn exists around "softly deliberate," but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion and read-aloud rhythm are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept of shareable dreams and unbound shadows is a fresh, organic synthesis. The transformation of the shadow through integration rather than destruction is a non-obvious, earned inflection. The story commits fully to its premise, and the combination of library, stone, and footage feels singular.</comment>
