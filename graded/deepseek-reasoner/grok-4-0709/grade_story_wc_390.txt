<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is a clear, potent blend of professional duty and profound personal grief, compelling his high-stakes choices. His "logically emotional" nature is embodied in his decision to use vibrational matching, a synthesis of his engineering skill and emotional need for absolution. The final moment where his own guilt surfaces provides a credible, earned emotional shift with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds: the intruders' approach forces Elias to adapt his professional knowledge into a defense, leading to a decisive change where the threat is neutralized. Closure is achieved with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias endures, protecting the orb and confronting his own guilt, with the cost felt in the final image of his ice-melt heavy coat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not just atmospheric but actively pressures the conflict, favoring the agile intruders and forcing Elias's tactical retreat. The lighthouse itself and the crystalline orb are key objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through Elias's professional and emotional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (protect the artifact) and escalate coherently under the causal lens from spotted intruders to a breached door. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through his adaptive choice to use vibrational matching. The cost is legible in the lead intruder's purification and Elias's surfaced guilt, though the others' flight slightly diminishes the final price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (sonic absolution), character (Elias's grief), and setting (the guiding lighthouse). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of forgiveness and duty. It avoids moralizing, sitting in the complex space between purification and the burden of protection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical precision ("vibrational matching") with lyrical yearning ("frozen ghosts"). The voice is consistent and effectively modulates under pressure. Some register drift occurs in peak beats with phrases like "fleshly pull of survival," which slightly clashes with the engineer's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-stacked or slightly mixed (e.g., "fabric whispering against his skin like a lover's breath" next to "frozen ghosts"), creating minor density artifacts that slightly dull clarity in high-pressure beats without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse engineer, a sonic artifact, and a drift-ice setting feels fresh and organic, not a checklist. The core concept of vibrational absolution is ingeniously integrated into the plot and character motive. The story commits fully to its premise, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
