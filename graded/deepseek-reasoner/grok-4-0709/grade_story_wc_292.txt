<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in family honor, and intensifies under pressure. Her "nervously confident" trait is embodied in specific actions (e.g., trembling hands, resolve). Interiority is concrete, though the final cost of her decision is more implied than deeply felt on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; decoding journals leads directly to her resolve to sail. Closure is a decisive change (her plan to perform the rite) with cost implied by the storm. Orientation is immediate and clear. Minor deduction as the cost, while legible, is not sharply visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The weather station is a pressure cooker, with "spongey dread" permeating every beat and constraining choice. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV's experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation is driven by her decoding agency, narrowing options to one path. Cost is legible in her decision to brave the storm. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and honoring the past emerges organically through the coded stanzas and the nail's reweighting. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The reversible exile concept is fully integrated into the narrative's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature attuned to decay and weather. Prose rhythm is controlled, and purposeful compression (e.g., the stanza) works effectively. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, atmospheric prose with strong information density. Slight deduction for minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "spongey dread" is repeated, and some metaphors like "humidity-warped maps curled like dying leaves" are slightly overworked), but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of reversible exile, a copper nail key, and a weather station is fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. The risk-taking with atmosphere and object-based plotting heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
