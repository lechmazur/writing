<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear, rooted in her trapped essence, and intensifies through concrete choices like adjusting the lamp. Her internal conflict—weaving others' freedom while bound—acts simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation of her prison is earned by the accumulated weights, with cost felt in the "infinite recursion snapped" line. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, though minor abstraction in "whalebone reverie" slightly limits peak-beat specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly: burdens accumulate into a meta-pattern that reweights her prison. Closure is a decisive change ("stepped free") with cost legible in the "boundaries emerged" image. Orientation is immediate ("bronze grotto under starlight"), and the constraint of recursion shapes tactics throughout. No causality breaks; the ending transforms prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and kerosene lamp constrain choices (e.g., lamp refraction enables calcification) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "drip of thawing ice" echoes motif). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the loom and lamp integrated into action. The setting's metallic texture mirrors the weaver's rigidity and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the weaver's agency under the accumulative lens: each calcification deepens the stake toward self-liberation. Cost is visible in the "grotto trembled" beat and her essence hardening. The dominant stake (imprisonment) tightens through patterned accumulation, foreclosing options until the meta-pattern breakthrough. No coincidence; resolution earned through tactical alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: burdens become tangible weights, and recursion breaks via oriented patterns. Subtext operates in images like "fractal shadows" echoing entrapment. The ending offers a non-literal answer—freedom through collected burdens—without moralizing. Minor risk of abstraction in "whalebone reverie," but anchored by concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature favoring fractal and metallic imagery. Diction remains within the weaver's lexicon ("calcify," "orienting"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the traveler's voice is absorbed into the hush, serving subtext. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., "wanderers came") is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("shingled hush enveloped the grotto"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught (e.g., "fractal" motifs). Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor register elevation in "whalebone reverie" but voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of fractal mathematics and emotional burdens feels inevitable. Specificity (e.g., "kerosene lamp burner") avoids tropes. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices like calcification as a physical ritual.</comment>
