<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her backstory, compelling her to pursue Thorne. Her "modestly fearless" trait is shown through her steady, compassionate approach. However, her internal contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are more summarized than dramatized in-scene, preventing a higher score. The final choice feels earned, with a visible cost of emotional labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for Thorne, Charged Poise for Elara) with a felt cost of release. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the harp's distorted notes and the gorge's echoes. Causality is tight; the harp's method directly enables the confession and healing. The cost is legible in the transformation of the crocodile's tooth and Thorne's dissolution into light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is indispensable, its echoing property directly enabling Elara's method and amplifying the spectral confessions. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception. The harp itself functions as a micro-setting, its warped frame crucial to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is driven by the increasing density of the harp's distorted symphony and the gorge's echoes, which reweight the stake of Thorne's release. The cost is felt in his rusty laugh and the tooth's transformation. Agency is clear in Elara's persistent playing, though the pressure is more atmospheric than a causal tightening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of healing through joy emerges organically from the specific action of infusing melody with laughter. The final image of Thorne's release offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of regret. Subtext operates powerfully in the transformation of the crocodile's tooth from a symbol of guilt to one of release, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, lyrical voice. The prose has a distinct texture with controlled, purposeful diction. The single line of dialogue from Thorne is effective and multiplies in the echoes, serving its goal. A minor register drift occurs with phrases like "luminous ache," but it is largely voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythm and varied syntax that supports the atmosphere. However, some figurative language ("luminous ache," "beauty laced with sorrow") borders on over-written in peak beats, creating a slight muddle. There is a minor paraphrase loop in describing the harp's purpose. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent, advancing the story effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a soul collector using a misaligned harp and laughter for healing is highly original and feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and method. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
