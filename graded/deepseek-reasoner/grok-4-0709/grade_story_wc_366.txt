<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and warmly observant nature are embodied through specific, concrete actions and perceptions, driving his choice to extend the letter chain to the ghosts. His motivation to "bottle safety" is deeply rooted in personal grief, compelling a high-stakes choice under pressure with visible cost. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though a minor tell ("his own hidden griefs") slightly abstracts an otherwise embodied interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the ghosts' peaceful release serving as a decisive change charged by the sea glass and stone method. The cost is legible in Elias's "quiet resolve" to continue, and the lens holds through pattern intensification. Orientation is immediate and precise; all elements cohere toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the closure, with sensory details filtered through Elias's professional bias ("etched with salt and sorrow"). The stone-stacking method and sea glass are tactile, lived-in objects that evolve under pressure. Specificity is high and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the lamp's failure intensifies the hauntings, forcing Elias to adapt the letter chain method. The cost is unmistakable as the ghosts calm and fade, reweighting the stake of solace. One meaningful tightening (the darkened lamp) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sea glass and stone motifs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of safety and solace without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material, and subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (the spirit touching the glass). Complexity is embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Elias's role ("waves curled like secrets"). The lyrical prose is pattern-taught and legible, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift, though the density occasionally borders on overwriting without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, though some figurative density ("luminescent ache," "ethereal glows") risks mild overwriting in peak beats without fully obscuring causality. Information density is high, and closure remains clear. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse hauntings, anonymous letters, and sea glass feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific, verifiable detail anchors the premise, and the core concept is transformed through grounded character choices. No derivative echoes.</comment>
