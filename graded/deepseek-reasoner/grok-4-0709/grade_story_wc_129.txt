<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lirah's motivation is clear and consistent, driving higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her bold sympathy is embodied in actions like offering talismans and comforting searchers, with micro-choices revealing values. The final renunciation of isolation is earned through causality, though some emotional states verge on summary near the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; the inciting incident (discovering the tag) triggers a because/therefore chain. Closure is a decisive change with cost legible in the arbor's creation ("the glowing pain of belonging"). Orientation is immediate, and constraints shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (crater's perilous edges) and charging the final image (arbor echoing tag's curves). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lirah's perspective. The orchard and crater are indispensable to the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens, with cost visible in resurfaced memories and physical peril. Stakes are signaled early and tighten through discoveries. Minor deduction for some declared stakes (e.g., crater fumes) not fully tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of kinship emerges through concrete actions and images (reed talismans, tag fragments), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the arbor's creation. Subtext operates in gestures and shared touches, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with lyrical prose reflecting Lirah's perception. Diction remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue, so those bullets are waived. Minor echo in repetitive "luminescent ache" phrasing, but overall voice is coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and variety. Some minor scaffold in repeated phrases ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") and a few mixed metaphors (e.g., "fruits... dangled like forgotten stars" slightly strains logic). Clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with artistic communication. Premise is fresh and fully committed, with specificity in world-building (crystal fruits, marsh reeds). Risk-taking in silent storytelling pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
