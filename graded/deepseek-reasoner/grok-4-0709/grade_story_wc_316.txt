<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kai's emotional numbness is embodied and concrete, driving his motivation to reclaim feeling. His final choice for unity over domination is earned by his prior realization that "we are mirrors." The clone, while vibrant, serves as a contrasting pressure source rather than a fully independent character, fitting the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: the clone's appearance directly triggers the trial, leading to the decisive change of merger. A minor orientation penalty (-0.3) applies as the clone's manifestation and the trial's rules are somewhat abrupt. However, closure lands with clear, felt cost as Kai's numbness is "defeated" and warmth floods back.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting stars provide a vivid, purposeful backdrop. The starlight blade constrains the final choice by slicing through illusion, though the setting's pressure on earlier tactics is more atmospheric than actively constraining. Sensory detail is selective and reflects Kai's detached POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the trial forces a choice, and Kai's realization about unity transforms the conflict's nature. The cost is unmistakable in the final integration, which forecloses on individual existence. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) is tested and resolved through concrete, on-page action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of wholeness through integration emerges organically from the conflict, avoiding moralizing. The final image of a "merged entity" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of selfhood. Subtext operates in the clone's claims and Kai's counter-arguments, enriching the thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a meditative, slightly detached quality fitting Kai's numbness. The clone's dialogue carries a sneering, emotive contrast. Purposeful compression is used effectively, such as in the climax where energies "intertwine." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong imagery ("swirling nebulae," "slicing through pretense like silk"). A minor loop exists in the repeated use of "numbness" as a label, but it's dramatized with embodied cost. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the meditative and action beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi clone custody battle within a mystical dojo setting is fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to, driving the plot and emotional arc. The resolution through unity rather than victory feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens the stakes meaningfully.</comment>
