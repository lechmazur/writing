<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling his high-stakes choice to shield the shard. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the poetic summary in the climax ("His heart ached with burnished sorrow") leans slightly toward diagnostic labeling, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("a fragile victory"). The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal plan, Accumulative atmosphere) holds. The mirror-covering method, while thematically rich, feels slightly under-motivated causally, serving more as a textural device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice (the chamber, the storm) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception, reflecting the POV's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens (devising the plan, executing it). The dominant stake (reimagining the civilization) tightens meaningfully, and cost is legible ("a fragile victory"). A stronger causal link for the method would have elevated the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding redemption through reimagining the past emerges organically from events and images, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The elevated, poetic diction is voice-motivated and consistent, though a few sentences verge on syntactic complexity that slightly obscures immediacy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, minor figurative density and a tendency toward complex syntax in some sentences create occasional momentum drag, preventing a higher score despite the overall beauty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque asteroid, visible time, and a defunct poet-revolutionary is a specific, non-obvious, and highly original combination. The risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
