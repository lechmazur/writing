<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait of calm inventiveness, which compels higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her internal state is shown through concrete, embodied action (e.g., improvising with the quill holder) rather than summary. The final choice to proceed with the revolution feels earned by her established history and the on-page cost of vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; Elara's actions directly trigger the plot's progression. Closure is a Charged Poise, crystallizing the imminent revolution with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate, and the final image of the fort "reborn through shadow" reconfigures the stakes with clear cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout are not just backdrop but actively pressure choices and supply the essential resource of cover. The sundial and quill holder function as micro-settings, constraining Elara's actions and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens; her use of the quill holder is a decisive tightening that narrows options and sets the final plan in motion. The cost of her vigilance and the risk of discovery are legible on the page, particularly in the interaction with the other sentinel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution against oppression emerges organically from the coded sundial, the blackout, and Elara's actions, not statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of power redistribution. The "cradle of sparks" concept is integrated into the thematic fabric without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that notices strategic details. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with the hushed tone. The single line of dialogue is natural and serves to heighten tension and illustrate the cover operation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The tone of the evening was a winking hush"). Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("calmly inventive," "half-painted") which, while effective, appear frequently. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The combination of a lock sentinel using a sundial and quill holder for coded rebellion is a highly original and specific synthesis. The core premise feels fresh and is executed with full commitment to its unique world logic and moral calculus. The ingenuity is organic and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>
