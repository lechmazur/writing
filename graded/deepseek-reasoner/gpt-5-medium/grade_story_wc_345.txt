<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV's interiority remains concrete and embodied throughout, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final collective action feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in raw hands and shared exhaustion. Emotional progression avoids diagnostic speak, layering fear, trust, and wonder credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the community enters the nebula, with cost legible in the "bruised fruit" and collective exhaustion. Orientation is immediate; pattern of bell/chalk/gifts teaches the world's logic early, paying off in the crisis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choices—floating arches force aerial navigation, moss paths accept chalk, bell's garden becomes tactical hub. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("hope here is brambled," "feel in our teeth"), and the environment evolves with events (fractured arch crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: the arch fracture forces collective action, narrowing options and raising cost. The braided alarm and chalk instructions orchestrate response, with visible cost in raw hands and shared effort. Dominant stake (collective survival) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—bell, chalk, shared hunger—culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "tired together rather than tired alone." Subtext operates in images (bell spraying mist) and implications, resisting moralizing. The final nebula image reweights prior struggle without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptually biased texture ("hope here is brambled," "smear of color"). POV stability anchors the accumulative design; elision (Lio's origin) is purposeful and paid off. Diction remains within the community's lexicon, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor figurative overuse in peak beats ("like a humble comet," "like rain inside our ribs") slightly mutes clarity, but momentum never stalls. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost-guided collectivism on a fantastical planet feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression and accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world and character.</comment>
