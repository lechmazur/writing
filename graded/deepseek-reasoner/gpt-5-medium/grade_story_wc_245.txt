<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation ("I did not come to erase my grief, but to learn its native coast") is earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction is shown through tactile memory and present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: "sorrow unfolds its chart without vanishing." Orientation is immediate; pattern of sensory accumulation tightens toward the stillpoint discovery with coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and tactile, filtered through POV. The compass ring and forest mechanics pressure tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's dowsing agency under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens through sensory density and pattern breaks toward the stillpoint. Cost is legible: "my ring cools so suddenly my finger aches" and the final reconfiguration carries felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to emotional navigation without moralizing. Subtext operates through tactile imagery ("bark syllables," "moth wing idioms"). Final image reweights prior material with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a strong perceptual signature. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Diction remains within character's lexicon despite elevated moments. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic with strong rhythm and variation. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("weaponed with silence") causes slight register drift but doesn't harm closure. Information density is high; no loops or scaffold artifacts. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sensory navigation and emotional mapping feels inevitable. Core premise offers fresh angle on internal journey. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universal themes.</comment>
