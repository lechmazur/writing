<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's synesthesia and role as a "cashier and conductor" are deeply integrated into their perception and actions. Their motivation to connect with the ghost and anchor the timeline is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in the micro-choice to "press the coin between my palms." The final endurance is earned, with a visible cost in the fading "blue bell" and the promise to "finish letting go together." A hairline deduction for the ghost's motivation being slightly more told than shown in his "genteel panic."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern repetition ("echoes," "fractures"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), achieved by braiding names into the wind and stepping onto the stage, reconfiguring the relationship with the past. The cost is legible on the page: the coin cools, the bell fades to a "thread," and the ghost must rehearse "a last bow for tomorrow." The structure is taut, teaching its pattern of echoes and reprises early and paying it off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's engine. The mystic orchard garden and amphitheater hollow are not just described but actively pressure choices, rearrange passages, and reveal lantern fruit. The tarot coin and the protagonist's synesthetic body function as micro-settings that constrain and enable action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through the protagonist's unique perception ("smell green cymbals and hear gold leaves").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake of preserving memory. The ghost's "genteel panic" and request to "anchor the Star" provide a clear tightening of pressure. The protagonist's agency in responding—pressing the coin, speaking the names—narrows options and leads to the closure, with the cost of the fading connection felt. A minor deduction as the ghost's request, while coherent, is the primary driver of the peak turn, slightly externalizing the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of character, setting, and action: the cost and necessity of caretaking memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the ghost rehearsing a bow "promising to return only if we can finish letting go together," reconfiguring the theme of holding on and release. Subtext is rich in gesture and image, such as the ghost reaching for "nothing, and nothing takes his hand." Eschews moralizing for complex, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a perfect fusion of poetic lyricism and narrative precision that remains stable under pressure. The POV is deeply anchored in the protagonist's synesthetic perception, creating a unique perceptual signature ("paint shivers like spilled music," "chord of blue I can smell"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. The ghost's dialogue carries a distinct, antiquated idiom ("the present is a house left slightly ajar").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative with excellent rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative density artifact occurs in the high-pressure beat: "I smell silver dust, hear burgundy in the rafters" slightly strains the established synesthetic logic (smell→sound, hear→color) in quick succession, creating a momentary muddle. This is a hairline slip that touches the closure scene, preventing a 9+ score. Otherwise, the prose is exemplary, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, a synesthetic cashier, and a fractal timeline is highly original and feels organic and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic vision. The specific, verifiable detail (e.g., "hand-painted tarot coin," "orchard garden") creates freshness without quirk.</comment>
