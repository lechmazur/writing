<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's motivation to translate distance into closeness is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the high-stakes choice to activate the relay. Embodied emotion and micro-choices (turning the leaf into a compass) reveal character under pressure. Harbor’s actions are consistent with her retired-worker patience, applying immediate pressure. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated interiority in "intuitively descriptive ledger keeper" label, but it anchors the trait effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sensory details (leaf, phonograph, grooves) deepens into a resonant reconfiguration at closure, reweighting distance as a lens with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure lands on-page with the sister's laughter and message, charging the final image with conceptual cost. The relay's activation is earned through established particulars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and pressures choices (scrapyard constraints, cracked wasteland). The leaf and phonograph function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's perceptual bias. No generic placeholder or white-room issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnecting with sister) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—using the leaf and phonograph narrows options and enables the relay activation. Cost is legible in the final exchange and the walk back. One meaningful deepening (decoding the cylinders) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of distance as a lens emerges organically from events and images (leaf, relay, communication), not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sister's message. Subtext operates in implication (Harbor's thumping tail, the riddle). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Diction and syntax reflect the narrator's descriptive nature. Dialogue (sister's message) is natural and advances plot. No head-hopping or register drift. Elision (riddle's answer) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language ("a door learning to breathe") is pattern-taught and supports pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements feels inevitable and fresh. The combination of leaf, phonograph, and relay is non-obvious and heightens stakes. Voice and vision are singular. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off at closure without gimmickry.</comment>
