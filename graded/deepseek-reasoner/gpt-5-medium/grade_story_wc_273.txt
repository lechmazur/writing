<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The albino tracker's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied contradiction ("serene anger"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final refusal of the throne is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("I refuse the throne and let the ink on my skin disappear"). The hummingbird's learning of the protagonist's hollow as a song provides a resonant, character-particular cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change (the metronome forgetting how to count) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, driven by pattern recognition and a final conceptual repricing. The cost is legible in the protagonist's dissolution of self. A slight deduction for the algorithm's late introduction, which feels more declared than fully integrated into the prior pattern-work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("auric ribs, tents smoothed to fossils, alleys hollowed like flutes"). The environment constrains tactics and is inextricably woven into the protagonist's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from tracking to seeding ink to entering the hut. A meaningful tightening occurs with the discovery of the second set of footprints and the algorithm, narrowing options. The cost is unmistakable in the final self-erasure, a price paid to end the market.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of crisis as currency emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the protagonist's refusal and the metronome's failure. The conceptual repricing—that time should not be owned—is earned and lingers with complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with scene needs. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—an albino tracker using disappearing ink to dismantle a market for slowed time—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination of elements feels organic and singular, not derivative. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, supporting the closure effect.</comment>
