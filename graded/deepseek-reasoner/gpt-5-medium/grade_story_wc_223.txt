<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to archive small gestures is concrete and compelling, embodied in micro-choices like cutting away apologies while holding elbows. The final shrugging off of the victim role is earned by prior causality, though the "benevolently ruthless" trait could be more visibly constrained by cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist chooses to travel with the nomadic penumbra, with cost felt in the relinquishment of the board and lantern. The ending image reweights the premise of history-making with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is indispensable, constraining choice by dictating the method of inscription and charging the final image with its "legible silence." Sensory detail is purposefully selective, filtered through the POV's archival mission, with the lantern's light and marble's echo actively shaping the scene's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from spelling single words to the more complex concept of "stay," tightening the stake of what constitutes true history. The cost is legible in the final relinquishment of the archive, though the pressure could cohere more sharply around a single, decisive choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from the contrast between the "loud things" and "small gestures," culminating in the final, resonant image of traveling with the penumbra. This is a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative, avoiding moralizing through concrete particulars like the button-comet and taped shoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, archival voice that modulates under pressure ("I was benevolently ruthless"). The patterned elision of the walking method is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon, even at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with exceptional rhythmic variety and information density. A minor deduction for a potential overwriting risk in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a nomadic penumbra that drifted with our breath"), though clarity is never obscured and the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a whispering gallery, a walking lexicon, and an interregnum is fresh, organic, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully, and the specific, verifiable details (e.g., "tape shoes skidding in rhythm") create a singular and memorable perspective.</comment>
