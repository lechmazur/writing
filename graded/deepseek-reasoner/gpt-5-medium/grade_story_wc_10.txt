<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("My hands trace arcs through winterlight"). The final choice—translating silence into music as a practice of staying—is earned by prior causality (the capsized ferry, the failed first attempt) with visible cost (the blistered lilies). Contradictory impulses act in scene: the need to translate silence battles the risk of misreading sadness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (from failed first attempt to successful performance) reweights the dominant stake (translating silence) with cost (the blistered lilies, the rewarmed palms). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of "unshaken marvels" balancing, with cost legible in the man who weeps and the satisfying, unheard click of the case.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is indispensable, constraining choice (the cold steadies to a clarity) and charging the final image (the city glows in reciprocal quiet). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("ice-limned ferns arch under glass ribs"). The environment is fully integrated into action and thought, a lexicon for translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the shift from the failed first attempt (a nation of wrong readings) to the successful performance (error corrected into grace). This is driven by protagonist agency (rewriting the algorithm, weighting the forks) and the cost is unmistakable (the blistered lilies, the rewarmed palms).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of finding meaning in silence: "We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance." Theme emerges from events and images (the tuning forks, the sensors, the frost) without direct statement, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("The river overturned my ferry, but not my need to translate silence into music"). POV is stable and apt, with purposeful elision (the exact nature of the "hush") that is taught and paid off. Diction remains within the POV's plausible, poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion ("Heat gathers where longing knots, cools where fear retreats"). Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddying sense in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally and accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic quiet, synesthetic translation, and personal grief feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (the heat-mapping system) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion.</comment>
