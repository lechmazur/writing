<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the tug of the rope around my waist, not as danger but as grammar"). The final choice to braid the past into present strength is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost of self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on the page ("forgave the version of me that ran first"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterned layers of imagery and meaning that culminate in a decisive internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the poet's perception ("its walls showed centuries of water and fingertips"). The rope and starlight are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear tightening as the energy being's vision forces a confrontation with the protagonist's past. The cost is legible in the mirror scene, where forgiveness becomes the price of progress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of time's texture through the image of braiding the past. Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's vow and the grotto's layered revelations, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent lyric voice. The energy being's communication through ripple and memory is a purposeful, pattern-taught elision that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, though some figurative language in peak beats risks density ("patterned footprints through the dust like a loom might weave a childhood"). No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully with the emotional rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of surreal energy beings and grounded poetic introspection feels inevitable. The concept of "time's texture" is transformed through unique, voice-driven particulars, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
