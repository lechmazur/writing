<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, consistent motive to honor overlooked histories. The final stance of waiting is earned by prior actions, though the character's internal contradiction under pressure could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the narrator waits for history to answer, with clear cost in the final image of weighted stillness. The pattern of building and observing signals builds pressure coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, supplying the reeds, pebbles, and pollen used for signals. The environment constrains and enables the protagonist's actions, charging the final image with the translated pattern on the walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in building increasingly complex signals, under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the final promise to "stitch their names from moss and echo," a trade-off between permanence and transience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the action of building temporary structures to honor the transient. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the value of transient gestures, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor risk of figurative density in peak beats ("burned syllable of orange") slightly mutes clarity, but overall propulsion and concision are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of esoteric realism with a lyrical, accumulative structure feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of interrupted cadences is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and action.</comment>
