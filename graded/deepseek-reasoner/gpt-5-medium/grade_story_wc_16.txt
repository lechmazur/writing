<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("carefully reckless, a maker of risks with railings"). The final choice to compose a suite of promises is earned by the backstory of the salt ravine and Lio's absence, with visible cost in the vulnerability of the act. The relationship with Lio is a crucible that forces a choice altering its state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density of language and pattern until a cadence shift (Lio's return) reweights the dominant stake of trust. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they walk toward the threshold, a crystallized moment of reconfigured options. Cost is legible in the "brittle" voice and lowered shoulders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The archive is not a postcard but a micro-setting that pressures choices and supplies resources (the Breviary, the inkwell, the shelves with "throats"). The glass inkwell and Breviary constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the linguist's POV ("Dust motes hung like annotations").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the act of composing the promises is a deepening that changes knowledge and options. The cost is unmistakable in the narrator's faltering memory and Lio's "brittle" voice. The dominant stake of restoring trust is signaled early and tightens through this single, meaningful act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of trust and communication emerges organically from events and images (the suite of promises, the Breviary, the stele). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Trust... is a choreography of shoulders turning toward one another." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("Dust motes hung like annotations"). The voice is consistently poetic but controlled, modulating with emotional intensity. The patterned, lyrical diction is taught early and pays off at closure, remaining legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is minor overwriting in peak beats ("Symphonies of truth require themes..."), but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. The final line's rhythm and image are masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic and musical metaphor ("symphonies of truth," "notation looked musical") is fresh and inevitable. The core premise of an archive of extinct languages offers a singular, non-obvious angle. The story commits fully to its poetic, conceptual premise without retreat.</comment>
