<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the line "I will go home and not decide, not yet; I will share the hinge and let it breathe us." The scar's cyclical nature and the shard as a vow provide consistent, flawed motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of the "readable surface" and the decision to "share the hinge" reconfigures the protagonist's stance with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits actively pressure choices and supply resources that shape the protagonist's tactics. The setting is not ornamental; it constrains and enables the journey, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a clear cadence shift and deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the protagonist's practice on water and the closing wound. Pressure coheres and grows, narrowing options through emotional intensity rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness and witnessing. Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the shard and the unsent letters, without moralizing. The final message on the glass provides a profound thematic reweighting that feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision that serves the accumulative design. The voice is consistent and character-specific, with a lyrical, introspective quality that modulates effectively with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, with varied rhythm and syntax that support the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of elements feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of the mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, and gargoyle shard creates a fresh, organic whole. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision feels authentically singular.</comment>
