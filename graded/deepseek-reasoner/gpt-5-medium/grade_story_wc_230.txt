<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's rationality and involuntary truthfulness create compelling contradictions under pressure, embodied in micro-choices like smearing the eye with clay. Final endurance of "fractured grace" earns its cost through prior causality. Emotional embodiment avoids diagnostic labels, though minor register drift occurs in "psychological safety" definition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly through density increases and cadence shifts. Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost legible in "orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured." Orientation anchors early with ravine, orchard, and virus context. Persistent constraint of truthfulness shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices through swaying bridges and storm damage, while the glass eye functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective ("ropes of rain," "moss") and filtered through professional forager perspective. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through accumulative density and the patrol's arrival, forcing the protagonist's clever truth-telling tactic. Cost is visible in the group's fractured laughter and the girl's unresolved pain. Agency manifests through endurance rather than decision, fitting the textural lens. Minor deduction for patrol's relatively easy departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the keeper ritual and storm-battered setting, avoiding direct statement. Final image of "fractured grace" offers resonant non-literal answer to psychological safety. Subtext operates powerfully in the glass eye's symbolic weight and the orchard's endurance. No moralizing or thematic echoing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with professional forager lexicon ("veined advice of my rational odd mind"). POV stability maintained throughout with consistent psychic distance. Experimental compression ("fractured grace") taught early and paid off. Rhythm control excellent under pressure, particularly during patrol confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional prose density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language consistently purposeful ("creaked like a chandelier"). Minor register drift in "psychological safety" definition slightly disrupts voice. No loops or template cadence. Final paragraph achieves powerful rhythmic cadence without artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and psychological elements through specific worldbuilding (empathy virus). Glass eye ritual transforms familiar confession trope. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation rewarded by coherence. No derivative template feel. Specificity in truffle foraging details creates authenticity.</comment>
