<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied contradictions ("glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs"). The final renunciation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the acceptance of coexistence with the dream. Motivation remains clear and intensifies under pressure, driving micro-choices like not winding clocks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as Earned Stasis (renunciation of rebuilding the city of bells) that forecloses a path with felt cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout, and cost is legible in the final image of meeting the dream "without demand."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is deeply integrated and constrains choices—the crystal forecourt and soundless sanctuary actively shape the protagonist's actions and reflections. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The environment charges the final image through the "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" that carries his apology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening as he shifts from avoidance to acceptance. Cost is unmistakable in the trade-off of not rebuilding the dream but inviting it as weather. Pressure coheres through sensory density and emotional intensity, narrowing options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions, with a resonant non-literal answer in the final reconciliation. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the finch's tilt and the crystal's echo. The piece avoids moralizing, embracing complexity through the ache of abandoned dreams and the cost of peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with consistent POV and voice modulation. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the character's lexicon, and syntax reflects his introspective state. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic cadence. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional, though "origami thunder" slightly strains coherence. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of silence and sound, abandonment and reconciliation. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail and emotional honesty, avoiding template plots or derivative echoes.</comment>
