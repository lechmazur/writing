<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("my hand ungloved so the coral's memory keeps speaking"). The final choice to interpret the cast is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The mother's and uncle's reactions feel authentic under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the shared interpretation of the boy's cast reconfigures family tensions. Cost is legible in the "knot slacken[ing]" and the room "unclench[ing]." Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are micro-settings that charge the final image and constrain choice. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("monitors speak pelagic syllables"). The coral evolves from relic to key, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in decrypting the cast, under the Accumulative lens. The stakes of familial reconciliation tighten through the deepening interpretation. Cost is felt in the traded words and the unclenching room.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the boy's drawing and the smudged cast, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about shared humanity. The final image of the coral "speaking" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the translator's perspective. Purposeful compression ("rain ticking like type") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for occasional over-densification in metaphor ("pelagic syllables"), but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of conflict-zone translation with a child's innocence feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "shared anxieties" is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
