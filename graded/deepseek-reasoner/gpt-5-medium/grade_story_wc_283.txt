<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in contradiction (duty vs. rebellion), embodied in sensory details ("hands smell of sand"). The final oath change from "counting to offering" is earned by the on-page choice to open the echo, with cost felt in the confessed theft. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of buttons and echoes builds to a cadence shift at closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy "softens into clay." Cost is legible on-page: "theft confessed without punishment." Orientation is anchored by line 2 ("amber warehouse beneath cliffs," "hourglass turner").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the warehouse "trembles" with cliff shifts, constraining choice, and objects (jar, buttons) charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("glass sweats with the breath of distance"). Micro-setting (ledger table, jars) functions as environment that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase through button cataloging, culminating in the villagers' arrival—a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake. Protagonist agency drives the unscrambling, with cost felt in the altered role ("oath has changed"). Dominant stake (freeing prophecy) is signaled early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: the prophecy as a "loom" not a "lock" is answered non-literally through the final image of shared carrying. Subtext operates in silence that "remembers it once was thunder." Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars (buttons, echoes) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("long ribs of dust and glass"). Lyrical compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("unearthed silence"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("a body is an instrument with a bridge"). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hourglasses, echoes, and buttons feels inevitable. Premise is transformed through specific lived detail (cataloging by material, weathering). Risk-taking in lyrical mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Element combinations are organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
