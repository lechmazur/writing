<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the kneeling confession and final exchange with the maze. Micro-choices (polishing, kneeling, offering soil) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered images and symbolic resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as gardener and garden achieve mutual recognition, with cost legible in "the work itself settled the account." Orientation is immediate; the taught pattern of ritual and measurement pays off elegantly at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. The maze grows a new corridor, the fountain "would not speak," and the oldest vine acts as a "green anchor." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the gardener's professional bias. The garden functions as a crucible, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (proving the garden's memory) and escalate through the maze's elegant objection—a meaningful tightening that forces the protagonist's kneeling confession. Agency is demonstrated through renunciation and endurance, foreclosing the path of performance with felt cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, reweighting the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central reciprocity between caretaker and cared-for, culminating in the profound, non-literal realization that "fortune is a mirror, and gardeners are light." Subtext operates powerfully in images like the cracked marbles aligning with hand scars. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive, measured rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's pragmatic wisdom. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon ("timid beetles," "patient green anchor"). Purposeful compression ("bones quiet as twigs") and patterned elision are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor repetition of "polish" in peak beats prevents a higher score, but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, advancing character and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise of measurable luck is brilliantly fresh, synthesized with the specific, lived detail of gardening rituals. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with bold risk-taking in the lyrical style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
