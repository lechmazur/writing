<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (polishing glass as a renunciation of fire) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice to string the lanterns is earned by the dramatized memory of loss, with the cost of patience versus quickness felt in the brother's absence. Contradictory impulses (longing for the brother's return versus commitment to a safer light) act simultaneously, not in alternation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, reconfiguring the protagonist's relationship to light and memory with a visible cost (the brother's continued absence). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and reflective cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. The final image of the lanterns "peopled by dusk and mist" is a decisive conceptual repricing of safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and sea glass function as a micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action (polishing). Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "sea glass, softened by years of salt and tumble"). The environment charges the final image, with the mist folding into the glass "like milk into tea."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative pressure, with the protagonist's reflective process deepening the stakes from personal ritual to communal offering. The dominant stake (sharing light without harm) is signaled early and tightens through the memory of the fire, forcing a trade-off between quickness and patience. The cost of this choice is legible in the villagers' "hearts a little tired of gray days."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of polished glass as "a listening, a way for light to be held until it remembers to be gentle." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of safety, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The core concept ("a pearl of stillness") is earned through specific, dramatized action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends poetic observation ("zephyr bloom") with concrete tactile detail ("the rasp of each circle"). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (the brother's journey) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "I set the oval on my tongue so it takes my warmth, and the salt brightness expands"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final paragraph's syntax and imagery accelerate the closure effect without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of star-watching, trauma recovery, and ecological mindfulness feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices (sea glass polishing as a methodical, non-destructive art). Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is singular and memorable.</comment>
