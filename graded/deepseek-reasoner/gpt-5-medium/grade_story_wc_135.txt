<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" is concretely embodied through handling the valve and listening for absences. The woman's emotional state is rendered with specific, contradictory detail, particularly when tracing the parade route on the fogged pane. Their micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (giving her the valve) carries a visible cost, earning the stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the harbor "carrying our small work like tide carries moonlight" reweights the premise of "navigated absences" with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of staggered intervals and collection is the engine, and the cost is legible in the woman's smile and the archivist's final note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "ivory harbor after rain" is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices, supplying the wet glass for tracing and the mist that thins. The herald's trumpet valve is a recurring object that constrains choice and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through the archivist's professional and poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase. The stake (hearten the harbor) is signaled early. Pressure coheres and intensifies through the rhythmic window tapping and valve turning, a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the passerby's pause and the woman's promise to return, foreclosing the path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of return through collected absence emerges entirely from events and images, not statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting "navigated absences" as "channels navigated." A minor deduction for the slightly explicit phrase "navigated absences" itself, though it is richly dramatized thereafter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("the windows bead with the last slow drops"). The prose has a masterful, controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision ("I write tone: none") are taught and paid off, contributing to the accumulative drive and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with every sentence advancing story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and voice-motivated, without muddle. Rhythm is varied and masterfully controlled, particularly in the description of the "choreography of not-quite sounds." Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of an "ocean-spray archivist" compiling "navigated absences" is a singular, non-obvious synthesis. The specific combination of the valve, staggered intervals, and the concept feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative, quiet structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
