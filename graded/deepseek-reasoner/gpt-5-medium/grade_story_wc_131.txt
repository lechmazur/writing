<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied through specific occupational details ("mapper of vents and joists, shuffling with pads of felt on knees") and a coherent internal contradiction between desire for visibility and methodical restraint. The final choice to help is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in his withdrawal and chalk-marking of routes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks (outage creates "sapphire hush"). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as his service redefines invisibility, with cost legible in "heart big as a boiler" and the tape settling "into stillness like soot."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (pipe chases, ducts) and charging the final image. The library breathes as a character; sensory details ("windows faintly breathed a failing constellation") are filtered through POV and escalate stakes. Micro-setting (tape, cache) actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the outage lowering the world's volume, allowing whispers to surface. Protagonist agency is clear in testing the tape and guiding the girl. Cost is felt in his withdrawal and the tape's dissolution, reweighting the stake of visibility through service.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of sense memory and the dweller's vow. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to visibility through service ("presence could travel through ducts"). No moralizing; complexity resides in the reconfiguration of absence and presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyric compression ("body a letter folded to fit"). POV is stable and voice-consistent, blending occupational precision with poetic observation. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control. Minor template cadence appears in adjacent "he [verb]" structures (e.g., "He crawled... he unlatched"), but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, sustaining momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of sense memory, urban isolation, and service. The crawl space dweller's perspective is fresh and specific. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off with clarity. Premise is fully committed and transformed through lived detail.</comment>
