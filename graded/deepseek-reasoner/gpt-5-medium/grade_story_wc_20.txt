<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("throat full of luminous regret"). The final choice to carry the balance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost ("I am not healed, but I am held together"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through density and pattern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost on the page ("I am not healed, but I am held together"). The final image reweights prior material and the persistent constraint of balance shapes the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The foundry is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action ("the foundry steamed like a wounded animal"). The assay cup and zodiac coin function as key objects that evolve and decisively shape the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the repeated, deepening act of testing names on the scale. The cost is unmistakable and legible on the page ("the coin dipped, almost imperceptibly, when I said hers, as if sorrow had mass"). A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient and masterfully executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of balanced remembrance emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss ("redeem itself by being precisely remembered"). The final image reweights prior material with profound emotional honesty, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, with a distinct texture in word choice and syntax that reflects the alchemist's worldview. Purposeful elision and compression are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero prose artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent ("a syllable that left golden soot"). Syntax and rhythm are perfectly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original and specific synthesis of alchemy and grief, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of kintsugi redemption is transformed through grounded, particular choices. The voice and perspective are memorable and authentic, committing fully to its premise without safety-hedging.</comment>
