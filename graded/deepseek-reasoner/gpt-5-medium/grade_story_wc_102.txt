<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's spiritual curiosity and past-life regret are embodied through concrete actions with camera obscura. The final choice to "send out the portions I never spent" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the storage closet unlatching behind her ribs. Contradictory impulses of hoarding and releasing act simultaneously in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the viaduct breathes easier and the protagonist decants rather than drowns. Cost is legible in the final image of "emptied jars" and the man's "unnamed ache" finding resonance. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct, camera obscura, and Kwan Yin's tear are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is a tactile, lived-in space that guides the protagonist's actions and mirrors her internal state with "foggy lucidity." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, using breath and the camera to deepen her search for unused love. The cost is unmistakable in the reconfiguration of her internal state and the physical response of the bridge. A single meaningful tightening from observation to active release is sufficient and powerfully executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of unused love and spiritual curiosity emerges entirely through image and action, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of "emptied jars" and the bridge humming reweights prior material without moralizing. The ending offers profound ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with exquisite rhythmic control; the voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's specific consciousness. POV is stable and deep, with syntax and diction reflecting her state. The elision of the man's dialogue into her perception is a masterful, taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and zero prose artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, purposeful, and pattern-taught ("interior weather," "attic lungs"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with the protagonist's own breath. Every sentence advances story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of spiritual inquiry, past-life memory, and camera obscura artistry. The core concept feels inevitable and wholly integrated, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific, verifiable detail creates immense freshness and authenticity of vision.</comment>
