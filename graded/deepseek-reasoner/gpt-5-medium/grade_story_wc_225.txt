<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices under pressure (e.g., "I tightened some threads into new anchors"). Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of a chess tutor. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic self-awareness in "I felt my exile curl tight around my throat, then loosen thoughtfully," which feels slightly performed for the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis) with clear, felt cost ("I left only the clocktower pigeons still as thoughts"). The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through the decoding of the tapestry's threads. The final choice to proceed incrementally is earned by prior causality and the protagonist's established traits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is a masterful micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image ("overflowed"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional bias. The time-frozen village is a pressure cooker that guides every action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each thread pull raising the cost ("with each wrong brush I tasted ashes"). The dominant stake (forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. A minor deduction as the cost, while felt, is slightly more conceptual than visceral in the final beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness through the final image of the overflowing labyrinth. Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The "woven hush" concept is fully integrated into the thematic fabric without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent, apt, and highly specific to the exiled tutor's worldview. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in "the storm muttered in sleep," which slightly violates the established physical logic of time being frozen. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A rare, fully integrated synthesis of chess, time magic, and tapestry-weaving feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on redemption. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Unconventional choices cohere into a singular artistic stance.</comment>
