<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV character's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Sori's quietly enthusiastic trait is shown, not told, through action. The final renunciation of shame feels earned by prior causality, with cost legible in "felt the old shame of my title fall away."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing where noise becomes prayer/purpose. The backwards prophecy structure is taught early and pays off at closure with cost ("swallowing the amber... usable silence"). Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck constrains choice (turning the dome) and charges the final image (becoming a lens). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV. Coins function as micro-setting, irreplaceably shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (hearing intention); escalation is driven by agency (coin flips, purging receivers). One meaningful tightening occurs as prophecy fulfillment compels distillation. Cost is legible in the final corridor of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through prophecy and coins; subtext operates in image and action. The ending offers a non-literal answer that reweights noise as prayer. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like "featherlight alloy that chimed a sad, thin yes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic compression; voice is consistent and pattern-taught. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure. Elision (e.g., prophecy structure) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density without clutter; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and lyricism; backwards prophecy premise is fresh and fully committed. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Elements feel inevitable in hindsight, not derivative.</comment>
