<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation ("hunger: to unravel the mystery") is clear, concrete, and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (e.g., touching the stone self) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final choice to wake and integrate her dream self is earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old path as a "ghost of unasked questions."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the queen integrates her stone self, wearing her dreams "like a ring." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks (the bleeding starlight pool, the crescent key) that reweight the dominant stake. Cost is legible on the page in her whispered renunciation of serving as a "ghost."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The cobalt grotto, the pool of starlight, and the ember grotto are not just described but actively pressure tactics and reweight meaning. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the queen's particular POV (e.g., "wind combed her braids").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification via the shared drink, the key crescent, and the final confrontation. Each pattern break reweights the stake of self-knowledge, driven by protagonist agency. The cost is unmistakable in her choice to wake her stone self, accepting the "lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of self-integration emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the calm pool and the worn ring, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence (e.g., the wanderer's bow).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("wind combed her braids," "stars bled like wounds"). The voice is consistently lyrical and precise, modulating with emotional intensity without register drift. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext (e.g., "Names are doors, he said, and so are silences").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("bleeding starlight," "lacy menace"). Rhythm and syntax accelerate and breathe with scene needs, particularly in the climactic grotto sequence. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a queen's mystical journey feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept of "bleeding starlight" is uniquely integrated into the story's logic and closure.</comment>
