<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interior contradiction embodied through probability/gambling duality; final choice to integrate both legacies feels earned through prior causality with visible cost ("felt the cut too"). "Theoretically rebellious" trait could be more active in on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage through subway code → lantern discovery; closure lands as Charged Poise with cost ("odds change, mercifully and slowly") under Hybrid lens. Slight ambiguity in whether lantern placement was coincidental or causal slightly weakens lens purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("clover melancholy", "rain made the ink bloom") with POV-filtered detail. Library setting enables choice but doesn't fully constrain tactics; lantern object charges final image but doesn't narrow options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meaningful tightening through code interpretation → lantern discovery; cost legible in final bus scene where protagonist accepts contradictory legacy. Agency drives escalation under Hybrid lens, though pressure remains somewhat internalized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic resonance achieved through lucid contradictions without moralizing; final image reweights prior material ("lucid contradiction could be a bridge") through concrete particulars. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with probability-infused diction; purposeful compression ("a phrase with odds stacked against grammar"). Minor register drift in peak beats ("lensing of the rain") but maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with strong rhythm control; minor figurative stacking in lantern discovery beat ("lensing of the rain, each drop a discrete coin") creates slight opacity but doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory and emotional legacy; risk-taking in lyrical/mathematical hybrid voice pays off. Transformation of gambling tropes through specific paternal relationship feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
