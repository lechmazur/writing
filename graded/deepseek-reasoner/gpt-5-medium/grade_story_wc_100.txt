<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through lines like "I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid." Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation is earned. Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry," which trends toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in the final image of the library as a "patient registry." Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The cost is legible in the line "the water slackens like a vow kept," showing the price of the protagonist's stubborn persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully constrains choice, as the underwater library pressures the protagonist's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, e.g., "shelves lean like old divers." The lighthouse lens charges the final image, acting as a micro-setting that reconfigures the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through the mantled thing's arrival and the dome's groan. Cost is legible in the protagonist's stubborn alignment of shards despite the warning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal is built and answered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the reconfiguration of "rest" as location rather than surrender. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication, e.g., "patience is how the sea kills."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature evident in phrases like "chased stillness breathing behind me." POV is stable and apt; compression is purposeful and taught early. Rhythm varies naturally, supporting emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, e.g., "carrying the shattered lens like a heart." Sentence-level propulsion is maintained throughout, and read-aloud rhythm is varied and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality is high with a fresh synthesis of maritime and funerary motifs. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle, and emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
