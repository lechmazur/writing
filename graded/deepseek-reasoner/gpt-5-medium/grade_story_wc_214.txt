<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a deeply embodied emotional progression. The protagonist's motivation to find strength in vulnerability is dramatized through micro-choices, like kneeling to align with the panels. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "spiritually curious" trait, which borders on diagnostic self-awareness in an otherwise earned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the station's thrum and the protagonist's gentler heartbeat after speaking the engineers' names. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks like the power failure. The final image of "spared collision" reconfigures the stakes with profound stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The yellow lantern glass, the copper-and-tea smell of the floor, and the station itself function as a micro-setting that pressures tactics. The environment is a character, with the console lights as pulse points and the roof opening as a final, consequential act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the power failure and the decision to open the roof. The cost is legible in the "absolute night" and the protagonist's admission of fear. A minor deduction as the meteor storm's arrival feels slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "flourishing stillness," resisting moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer. The final realization—"not to erase marks, but to polish them into guidance"—is earned through the specific struggle with the station's memory and ache. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a janitor's poetic, tactile sensibility. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, from the murmured sky to the loud hoofbeats of meteorites. Purposeful elision, like the cracked love, is taught and paid off, enriching the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with excellent rhythmic control and vivid sensory detail. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "fossil pollen," "like a throat") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks clarity. Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic janitor is a singular, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. The perspective is deeply memorable, transforming the trope of isolation into a specific, grounded exploration of maintenance as a spiritual practice. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
