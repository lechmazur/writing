<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is vividly embodied and rooted in sensory curiosity, with micro-choices (pressing palm to glass, waiting in loft) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final realization feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the mural's creation. Quietly driven trait consistently shapes actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where night is repriced as "gentlest daylight." Closure lands with cost in the final postcard revelation, transforming the initial question. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with the cathedral setting anchoring the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and charges choices—the etched glass filters perception, the pavilion transforms light, and seasonal changes mirror internal progression. Sensory details (cloves and iron, resin and apples) are selective and purposeful, deeply integrated with character perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens—waiting for twilight, interpreting postcards, painting the mural—all tightening the central stake. Cost is legible in the months-long dedication and the final transformative realization. Pressure coheres through sensory and intellectual deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through layered images (engraved night, postcards, moths) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the floral question, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates through implication and image, particularly in the grandmother's correspondence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptually sharp texture that reflects the artist's worldview. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful compression (e.g., "umbral tenderness") serves accumulative design and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("dark petal cupped to the ear") is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor register drift in peak beats ("pollens," "umbral tenderness") but does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of botanical inquiry, artistic process, and familial legacy feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a non-obvious emotional calculus.</comment>
