<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's revolutionary past and poetic inclination drive micro-choices (covering mirrors, public readings) that reveal hierarchy of values under Ledger's pressure. Final endurance of defunct status feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in "sorrow shone, burnished." Contradictory impulses (starving poet vs. archived revolutionary) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirror-covering and shard-reading intensifies through density increase, culminating in council hall performance that reweights civilization's meaning. Closure is Conceptual Repricing via "we made, we made, we made" revelation, with cost legible in protagonist's bowed sorrow. Orientation anchors (asteroid, revolutionary role) established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's "veils of years" and time-storms actively constrain tactics (mirror-covering ritual) and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective ("oxidized velvet iron", "visible seconds") and filtered through poetic perception. The shard itself functions as micro-setting that alters choices and reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute escalates through protagonist's agency (devising ritual, public readings) under Accumulative pressure. Council hall performance represents meaningful deepening that forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in Ledger's "muffled, perplexed, and aging" laughter and protagonist's enduring sorrow. Dominant stake (reimagining civilization) tightens through shard's evolving use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shard's revelation ("ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty") rather than statement. Final image offers non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Complex ambiguity persists in "revolution remained defunct" while civilization's meaning shifts. Subtext operates powerfully in mirror-covering ritual and shard's "silent choir" etchings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct poetic-perceptual signature maintained under pressure ("time's veils ceased preening"). Purposeful elision (shard's exact translation) taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but character-specific (Ledger's dismissive laughter vs. protagonist's lyrical readings). POV stability allows clean psychic distance shifts during council performance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans") serves pattern and payoff. Rhythm accelerates purposefully during storm sequences. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("tenderness bowed me") feels voice-motivated rather than jarring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological dispute with visible time creates non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity (crystal vase shard, mirror-covering ritual) feels indispensable. Transformation of "ornament" from tyranny to solidarity feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
