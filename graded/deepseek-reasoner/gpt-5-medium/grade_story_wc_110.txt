<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied emotions ("shiver," "heartbeat is a drum") and a credible micro-choice arc from cowardice to courage. The final renunciation (confessing to eavesdropping) is earned by prior causality, though the internal contradiction between fear and duty could be slightly more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, with pattern breaks (doodle revelations) escalating to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Cost is legible on-page in the registrar's confession and the community's slow nod. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure unit lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (puddles as reflective surfaces, crystals as listeners) and charges the final image ("bright ripples across our shoes"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the doodle projections serving as a decisive deepening that reweights the dominant stake (trust). Cost is unmistakable in the confession and the physical production of missing parts, altering tactics and foreclosing paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of transparency versus mistrust emerges organically through images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the truth, exposed, is gentle enough to sleep in") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Purposeful elision (cryptic doodles) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; syntax and rhythm heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without artifice. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("puddles murmuring like glass throats"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of setting and concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
