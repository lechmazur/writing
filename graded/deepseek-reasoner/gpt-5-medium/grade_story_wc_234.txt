<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion. The "scientifically romantic" trait drives a micro-choice under pressure (the calibration instead of a kiss), though the final renunciation feels slightly more thematic than causally earned with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with conceptual cost ("presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry"). The pattern of returning to the moment ("returning differently") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl is a micro-setting that actively constrains the choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, with the ember nexus providing a coherent, pressuring environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear cadence shift into calibration. The cost is legible ("Each return loosens a knot in our shoulders... becomes ballast instead of bruise"). A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of capturing presence. Theme emerges organically from the experiment's particulars, resisting moralizing. The final image of "traveling on a compass we forged together" reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The lyrical, compressed diction is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. POV is stable and the voice is singular and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly original with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor risk of overwriting in a few high-density figurative lines ("quiet crownlets that settle on our hair like moths that have learned metallurgy"), but clarity and momentum are never lost, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of alchemy, poetry, and physics. The core concept feels inevitable and is executed with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific, grounded choices transform any potential tropes.</comment>
