<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's claustrophobia and desire for "intangibly tangible" silence are embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly when limiting exposure to the gilded hush to avoid losing her desire for exits. The final choice to share the silence with her father is earned by prior causality, showing a visible cost in her fear of losing doors. Internal contradiction is vivid: she is "made of exits" yet seeks a silence that could make her stop wanting them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the shared silence reconfigures the father's understanding of safety, with cost legible in the softening blueprints. The gravity inversion premise is taught early and pays off. All beats accumulate sensory density toward the final reweighting without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The xenial trellis constrains choice by offering specific alcoves of silence and teaching the protagonist how to land gracefully. Sensory detail is purposefully selective (e.g., "honey strained through linen") and filtered through the POV's unique perception. The trellis as micro-setting actively charges the final image by teaching widening entrances.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the act of "limiting exposure" to the gilded hush deepens the stakes by introducing fear of losing her core identity. Cost is unmistakable when she fears stopping wanting doors. One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to share the silence, narrowing her options to a single transformative act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of concrete vs. intangible safety, resolved by the non-literal image of "mapped hush." The father's realization that safety can taste like "home" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the shared silence that brushes lips "like an answer you do not need to say."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature marked by synesthetic imagery ("pulse burr like a trapped moth"). Diction remains within the protagonist's lexicon despite poetic density. The only minor flaw is a slight rhythm flattening in the alcove-tasting paragraph, but it doesn't disrupt voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density ("gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen"). One minor artifact: the phrase "stretching contracted like a lung exercising itself" creates a slight rhythmic stumble through near-oxymoron. However, clarity and momentum remain strong, and closure is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and sensory exploration feels inevitable. The gravity inversion premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail (ladders sprouting from drains). Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The porcelain doll as a listening device is particularly ingenious.</comment>
