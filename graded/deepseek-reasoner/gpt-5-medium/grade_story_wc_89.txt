<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply embodied through sensory details like "the tide keeps pulling at the ribs." Internal conflict is palpable in the reluctance to sacrifice their voice, and the final choice is earned with visible cost. Mira's late appearance limits on-page relationship depth, but her presence charges the closure effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's metamorphosis into a "passage" reweights the bond with palpable cost ("I lose the plain speech of markets"). Orientation is immediate, and the fortune cookie slip's transformation into bark provides a decisive, cost-laden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable and actively pressures choices: the orchard "exhales," apples shine "like moons," and beasts respond to the mortar "as if a bell." The spices constrain and enable the protagonist's goal, and the environment charges the final image with the moon's permanence and the beasts as witnesses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—conjuring Mira via spices forces the reluctant metamorphosis choice. The cost is unmistakable: losing their original voice and solitude. The stakes (reforging a bond) are tested and deepened through this trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis as "refraction" rather than subtraction emerges organically through the spice ritual and final image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to bonding beyond death, reweighting prior motifs (e.g., fortune slip becomes bark) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("hair a slow flame, eyes the exact green of early pears"). Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "cosmic intimacies") are taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue is effectively soundless, maintaining tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic but controlled; figurative language serves pressure and closure. Minor over-density in phrases like "cosmic intimacies naming the particular hinge of her smile" slightly risks obscurity, but rhythm and clarity hold overall. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism, grief, and sensory ritual feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise (reforging bonds through metamorphosis) is transformed through specific, lived detail like the spices and fortune cookie.</comment>
