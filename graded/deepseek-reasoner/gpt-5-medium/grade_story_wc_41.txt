<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's actions are deeply rooted in his precognitive forgetfulness and desire to capture time's sound. His micro-choices—using chalk, arranging driftwood—reveal a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied emotion is strong, though some interiority leans toward abstraction. The final acceptance of forgetting is an Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as he accepts his forgetting and sets markers for his future self. Cost is legible in the final image of him leaving while the statues remember. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. One meaningful cadence shift occurs as the echo returns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through the prophet's unique perception. The environment evolves with the tide, and key objects (chalk, driftwood) are integrated into action. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the prophet's agency under the Accumulative lens, through his attempts to capture sound and arrange markers. The dominant stake (capturing time's sound) deepens into a acceptance of forgetting, with a visible cost paid in the final beat. Pressure coheres and tightens through a single meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the struggle with memory and time, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the prophet's acceptance. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, particularly the chalk lines fading and the driftwood rearranging. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within the prophet's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though occasional phrases approach abstraction ("a sound like laughter wearing a limp"). No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of precognitive forgetfulness, echo-capturing, and a foggy sculpture garden feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Emotional truth and human complexity are paramount.</comment>
