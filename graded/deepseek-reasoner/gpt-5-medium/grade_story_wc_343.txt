<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied curiosity ("compass dust on my cheek"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation of glory ("pretended not to glow") is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("my ribs were lantern slats").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases (dog-ear, hopscotch, murmurations) to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with felt cost ("my hands rang like bowls") and the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is purposefully woven into action and choice. The airship, hopscotch board, and dog-ear all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through a professional POV ("altimeter and kettle").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The stake (mapping the light) is signaled early and tightens through pattern recognition. Cost is legible in the final, charged image and the physical toll on the narrator.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pattern and motion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of discovery, reweighting prior material ("language becomes motion and motion becomes light") without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific. Purposeful elision (e.g., the helmsman's grunt) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("gauze soaked in mint"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of the mundane (hopscotch) and the magical (stranded light) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic and highly memorable.</comment>
