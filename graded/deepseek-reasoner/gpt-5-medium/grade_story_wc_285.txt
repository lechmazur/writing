<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coachman's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (offering the needle, setting the oar). Wren is a distinct, pressure-applying secondary character. Their final choice to stitch the map is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the reconfiguration of the fog and hills.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the fog parts and the hills are reconfigured, with cost legible in the final image: "the hills looked less like burdens and more like breathing." Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains vision. Key objects (yarn needle, ferry, map) charge the final image and constrain tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the act of stitching the map is a decisive deepening that reweights the stake (safe passage) and narrows their options, with cost felt in the steadying of the ferry and the parting of the fog.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of weaving past and future emerges organically from the palimpsest map and the stitching action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the transformed hills, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic cadence. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You look like rain"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the coachman's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight risk of density in phrases like "spindrift serenity" is mitigated by pattern-teaching and payoff. Zero loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of familiar elements (ferryman, map, promise) made fresh through specific, grounded choices in voice, imagery, and the central stitching action. The risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
