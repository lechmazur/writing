<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's grief and kintsugi-driven motivation are deeply embodied, with micro-choices like fitting the charm as a pendulum revealing a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict between doubt and hope is rendered through concrete, sensory details—salt-smelling hands, trembling—avoiding diagnostic speak. The final endurance of "sharpened hope" is earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the workshop's temporary steadiness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens dominates, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the engine's revelation reweights absence into pattern. Causality is tight: the pockmark-matching method and charm’s integration drive the climax. Cost is felt in the line "It does not give me her, but it gives me the pattern of her choosing," crystallizing the trade-off. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid-sea workshop constrains choices (cistern plunges for clarity) and charges the final image (pontoons rising as acid "forgot its hunger"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—green fumes, hissing kisses, gear-and-cog textures—filtered through the alchemist’s expertise and grief. The statue and charm are irreplaceable objects that shape tactics and closure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: each measurement and plunge deepens stakes toward the engine’s activation. The dominant stake (emotional resolution) tightens through the irreversible act of fitting the charm, forcing a trade-off between presence and pattern. Cost is legible in the bittersweet revelation that substitutes truth for recovery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through kintsugi and absence, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—mending as gilded fracture—that reweights prior motifs (brine editing fumes, charm as pendulum). Subtext operates in gestures like the charm swinging toward the statue, implying renewed connection without declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic-perceptual signature ("night rusted with green fumes") that modulates under pressure without convergence. Diction remains within the alchemist’s lexicon (solder, kintsugi, formulas). Elision (Mira’s fall) is taught early and pays off in the engine’s revelation.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("acid sea gnaws the pontoons") is coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates toward closure ("the engine drinks the room") without obscuring clarity.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, grief, and kintsugi feels fresh and inevitable. The floating workshop and memory engine are non-obvious yet organic to the emotional arc. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure’s conceptual repricing is bold and earned.</comment>
