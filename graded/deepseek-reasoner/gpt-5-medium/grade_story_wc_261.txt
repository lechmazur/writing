<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and contradictory ("closure seeker who opens wounds"), with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Telepathy with plants constrains actions and charges the final choice, though some abstract phrasing ("displaced miracle") slightly distances peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) via the planted ivy ritual, with cost legible in "carry her steadiness forward." Orientation is immediate; causality tightens through plant whispers and coffee ring examination toward the tunnel descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower, hourglass, and tunnel scar function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frosted hourglass," "ivy on the sill"), with spatial choreography coherent in the descent and chamber.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closure for Mira's loss) escalates through protagonist's agency—descending to the tunnel, cracking the hourglass—under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the ritual planting and the reconfiguration of purpose ("closure is not a gate but a garden").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of misdirected miracles and scar-reading emerges through events and images (coffee rings, hourglass, ivy), not statement. Ending offers a non-literal answer via the garden metaphor, resisting moralizing. Subtext in plant whispers deepens emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("meteor hush," "needles of light"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("roots braid time," "soil scars") are taught early and pay off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible ("sand whispering down like distant rain"). Closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of plant telepathy, coffee ring divination, and tunnel collapse feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (e.g., "fossilized coffee ring").</comment>
