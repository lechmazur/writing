<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in micro-choices like pressing the fossil to the wall. The final renunciation—leaving the fossil as "resident not carried"—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, foreclosing a path with felt weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) via the fossil's placement, reconfiguring the relationship with the cave. Cost is legible in the "warmth persists like a held vowel" and the promise recorded as a "material." Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is a micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., navigating low shelves, the throat tunnel) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the storm surge forces a tactical withdrawal and a deeper placement of the fossil, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the water's attempt to "erase the plateau" and the protagonist's promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of speaking for the unknown through the image of the fossil as a "contract." Theme emerges organically from the fusion of forest, cave, and human time into a "shared sentence," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression ("Flood, pause, seed, branch..."). POV is stable and apt; the voice is singular and coherent, modulating with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "heat map flares a green vein"). Syntax and rhythm accelerate with the storm surge without becoming sluggish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of scientific mapping and mystical communion feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric-prose hybrid heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular detail.</comment>
