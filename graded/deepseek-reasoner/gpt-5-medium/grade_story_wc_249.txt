<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied interiority ("ribs hollowed like flutes") and micro-choices (drumming as rebellion) revealing values. The final endurance—carrying donors' memories—is earned with visible cost. Minor abstraction in peak emotion ("auroral sorrow") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds strong, building through sensory patterns to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Orientation is clear early ("research wing," "courtyard"). Cost is legible on-page: "carried fragments of Mira... promised them I would tap out their names." The sound-wave pattern teaches early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral to choice and closure: the sound wave garden constrains action (drumming unlocks corridors) and charges the final image ("lagoon threaded breath through wires"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV urgency. The auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens—drumming intensifies to bridge-building, forcing a trade-off (carrying donors' memories). Dominant stake (Mira's awakening) tightens through cadence shifts. Cost is unmistakable: "I would carry what did not belong."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action: entanglement as love, not side effect. Subtext operates in implication ("bridge still standing"). Ending offers a non-literal answer through shared awakening and acceptance of donors' memories, resisting moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("hush of the universe inhaling"). Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught early and pay off. POV is stable and voice-consistent. No head-hopping; elision serves accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional. No loops or scaffolding. Syntax varies purposefully with pressure. Minor register elevation in "auroral sorrow" is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory entanglement and sound-based communication feels inevitable. Specific, grounded choices (whale letters, resonance beds) avoid tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity transcends template plots.</comment>
