<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilias's "luminous skepticism" is embodied through concrete choices (refusing the broker's flood) and internal contradiction ("doubt as a way to listen"). His final commitment to continue walking is earned by prior causality and the visible cost of slow, patient work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through patterned breadcrumb discoveries leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ilias continues his work, the cost of his patient endurance felt in the "defiant hush" and promised rain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains choice (dry fountains, dust) and charges the final image. The stained glass box and city itself are micro-settings that actively shape tactics and outcome with vivid, purposeful sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Ilias's agency under the Accumulative lens, his refusal of the quick flood being a key tightening choice. The cost of his slow, patient method is legible in the broker's departure and the gradual return of trickles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of patience as active remembrance emerges organically from events and images, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final line. The concept of "sidereal patience" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and purposefully compressed, with any elision (e.g., "the arithmetic of absence") taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional phrases verge on over-written ("evaporating silver"). No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion and clarity are maintained, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of mythic and realist modes feels inevitable. The core concept of liberating memories through patient, somatic action is specific, non-obvious, and fully committed to, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
