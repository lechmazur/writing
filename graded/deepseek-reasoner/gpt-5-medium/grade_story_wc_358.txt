<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The investigator's motivation is clear and rooted in professional ethos; embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., chalking arrows, radioing the harbor) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance—planning fiercely but promising nothing—is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The child's introduction briefly tests the POV's adaptability without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the air's new behavior is understood and managed, not defeated. Cost is legible in the final inventory of "what almost failed." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the disorientation of silence serves the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The container labyrinth actively constrains choice and charges the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "mothball sweetness," "ribbon tape flashes"). The environment is a causal agent, training the dust devil and shaping the survey tactics. Micro-setting (the patch, the chart) is integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens; the survey tightens options and forces a tactical trade-off (the offset landing rule). The cost of almost-failure is legible in the final inventory. The dominant stake (safe landing) is signaled early and tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>The theme of foresight vs. hindsight emerges through action and image, not statement; the final answer is non-literal ("the air will be different tomorrow"). Subtext operates in implication (e.g., the patch as "borrowed authority and a vow"). Resists moralizing; complexity lingers in the acceptance of perpetual adaptation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt; voice has a distinct perceptual signature ("canyons do not care about names"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and pay off. Dialogue (with the child) is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext and advancing the plot without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("glitter like dark cliffs," "trained by walls to grow teeth"). Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of accident investigation and aerodynamic phenomenology; the professional perspective feels authentic and singular. Tropes are transformed through grounded, specific choices. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
