<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation ("hunger of drought") intensifies credibly through micro-choices like refusing purity bargains. Final renunciation of publication for alignment shows earned endurance with visible cost in altered perception. Contradictory impulses ("refusal felt like a smaller betrayal") act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-breaking ("blinked without rhythm") enables progression to closure. Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with cost: "my pulse into direction" and "heart calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths" reconfigures options. Orientation anchors early with concrete sensory details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive constrains choices through rearranging architecture and hexagram tiles. Pagoda and mirrors charge the final image by returning the protagonist's face "with the child's gaze." Sensory details are purposefully selective ("dust rose in quiet spirals") and reflect POV's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's pattern-breaking agency under Accumulative lens. Meaningful tightening occurs through refusal to bargain ("I refused to bargain"), narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final transformation: "we could be altered, which is the only honest theft."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant images ("atoms of nostalgia like lantern seeds") without moralizing. Final non-literal answer reweights prior material: "love is what restores the city after archives." Anguished joy threads visions with tangible cost, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical compression ("twilight here was a verb"). Patterned elision (archive's rearranging) taught early and pays off at closure. POV stability maintained through consistent embodied perception ("dyed my fingertips with rumors of vanishing").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite rhythmic control with high information density ("a slow steeping of light"). Zero prose artifacts or loops; figurative language consistently coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with climactic litany while maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological exploration and metaphysical transformation. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction pays off with conceptual integrity. Specificity in details ("compass that pointed to yesterday's most honest mistake") avoids generic templates.</comment>
