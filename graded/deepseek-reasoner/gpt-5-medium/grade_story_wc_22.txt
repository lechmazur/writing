<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coachman's characterization is deeply integrated through his actions and perceptions. His motivation to "let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is dramatized through specific, embodied micro-choices like cracking pods and listening to birds. A minor deduction for a slight drift into elevated, summary-like phrasing ("submerged concord alive, a treaty") in an otherwise concrete interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. The structure builds pattern and density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: the "treaty tightening" and battlefield "unlacing under green." Cost is legible in the final image of the cart crossing the jetty "narrow as mercy," a reconfiguration earned by the accumulation of deliberate, patient acts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and function. The "blooming jetty," "salt-slick boards," and "pit of bayonets" are not just vivid but actively constrain and enable the protagonist's choices. The environment charges the final image, with the jetty itself becoming a central actor and symbol of the reclaimed space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening cadence shift that reweights the stake from mere gardening to enacting a "submerged concord." The pressure coheres around the protagonist's agency in listening and translating. The cost is the visible, patient labor and the conceptual price of holding a truce between memory and life, making the final quietude feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of battlefield and garden, death and reclamation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "narrow" jetty of "mercy," avoiding moralizing. The concept of "submerged concord" is fully integrated into the action and imagery, resisting abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The voice is consistent and purposefully elevated, motivated by the character's role as a translator of languages and landscapes. The prose rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating with the quiet, deliberate pace of the action. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("seeds rustle like crows' feet on vellum"). A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in a few densely metaphorical phrases (e.g., "narrow vastness is a road"), though the pattern is largely taught and coherent. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story's synthesis of elegy, ecological reclamation, and quiet myth-making is highly original and specific. The core concept of a "submerged concord" is transformed from a theme into a dramatized, enacted pact. The perspective is memorable and feels authentically singular, not derived from common templates. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical style pays off.</comment>
