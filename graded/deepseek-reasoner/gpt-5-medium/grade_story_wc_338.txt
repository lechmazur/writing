<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "methodical curiosity" is embodied through concrete micro-choices (comparing videos, tracing the seam) that escalate under pressure. The final choice to frame the map with the tear visible is a credible renunciation that forecloses easy resolution with visible cost. Interiority remains specific and contradiction-free, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: the map tear motivates video comparison, which prompts the vault investigation, culminating in the door's discovery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the village's quiet acceptance reweights the hush from mystery to architecture. Cost is legible in the verger's wiped face and the framer's steady hands guarding gratitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the finale. The fresco vault's damp wall directly enables the discovery; the "slit that drew storms" architecture solves the central mystery. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("rain eats old limestone") and professionally filtered through the framer's perceptive bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to communal revelation under causal pressure. The protagonist's agency drives each turn: video analysis prompts key request, seam tracing confirms hypothesis. Cost is felt in the verger's reluctant agreement and the collective decision to reopen cautiously, altering the village's relationship with its history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence is reinterpreted through physics and care, not miracle. The final image of the framed tear offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the known/unknown divide. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures (verger's crossed self) and the architecture itself as a character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is exceptionally stable and voice-driven, with distinct perceptual signature ("rain eats old limestone like a slow animal"). Purposeful compression ("shielded openness") is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains consistently within the framer's professional yet poetic lexicon, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is masterfully controlled with high density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("sheep threaded between the stones like needles"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during discovery and breathing at closure. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography, architecture, and silence feels inevitable in hindsight. The "whispered chapel" concept is transformed through specific physical mechanics rather than supernatural tropes. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fulfilling the freshness mandate.</comment>
