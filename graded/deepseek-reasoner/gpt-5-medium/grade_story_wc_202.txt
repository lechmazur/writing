<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories is concrete and drives all choices. Embodied intuition ("anchors of intuition tightened") and micro-choices under pressure (leaning in, speaking coordinates) reveal character. Final choice to return the name is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the market tilts, painter lowers eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory and conceptual details escalates toward resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as the child's name surfaces and the scene "quit drowning in anonymity." Orientation is clear by line 4 (who, where, when). Persistent constraint of the lens fragment shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and actively pressures choices (rope bridges sigh, market tilts). The lighthouse lens fragment constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV—e.g., "varnish became tidewater" through the lens. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (recovering overlooked histories) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: using the lens fragment deepens knowledge and forces the choice to speak the name. Cost is legible as the market tilts and painter lowers eyes, reweighing the value of truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions—memory, loss, and witness are explored through the painting and lens. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the recovered name reconfigures anonymity without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (painter's shrug, nod) and implications ("absence as a harbor").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("every world speaks, but not all tongues are oral"). Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure ("anchors of intuition tightened"). Purposeful compression ("eternal instant") is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (painter's amused watch).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional (e.g., "elusively tangible" recurs in action). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphors, but they serve the accumulative design and do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (translator of non-oral tongues, alchemist's market) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details (lens fragment, berry salts). Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
