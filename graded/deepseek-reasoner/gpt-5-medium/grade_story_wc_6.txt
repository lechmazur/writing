<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictions (arsonist's daughter/firefighter) are embodied in micro-choices like grafting hope onto a stump. Final renunciation of her father's purpose while retaining his skill is earned through the lagoon ritual, with cost visible in the "tide worked steadily" in her chest. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional specificity remains concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fire/water imagery tightens toward the lagoon's "chorus of tiny breakages," culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her unyielding compassion becomes an "engine." Cost is legible in the boy's "smile as if he were forgiven by the wind," reconfiguring trauma without erasure. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains choice (kneeling at its edge enables the ritual) and charges the final image ("kelp-drift peace"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wind smelled of salt and cooled lava"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the lagoon's formation causally tied to the tide breaking a lava shelf.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to use the coin and sand at the lagoon deepens the stake ("prove that scars can sing"). Cost is felt in the boy's bandaged hand and the grafting act, which forecloses a path of pure firefighting for one of teaching. No coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action (grafting, the coin's swing) rather than statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer to healing trauma: "a tone that remembers without burning." Subtext operates in gestures like wrapping the graft with red thread, vowing connection between earth and water. No moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," "clouds traveled like herons") with rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and voice-motivated; elision (father's backstory) is taught early and pays off in closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present ("listen with his scars").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and cohesive (fire/water, grafting). One minor density issue: "gracefully alert patience" slightly stacks modifiers, but clarity at closure is unharmed. No loops or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of arson/firefighting, healing, and elemental symbolism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail (black sand as ballast, coin as pendulum). No derivative echoes.</comment>
