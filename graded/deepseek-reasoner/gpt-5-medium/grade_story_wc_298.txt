<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like giving away their name. The final choice to plant stories as seeds shows earned growth from reckless idealism to purposeful sacrifice. Emotional progression feels authentic, with micro-choices under pressure revealing value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong—pressure builds through density of imagery and symbolic weight rather than causal turns. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in the sacrifice of grandmother's stories. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable—the catacomb orchard constrains choices (bone-pit navigation) and charges the final image (roots accepting seeds). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action with vivid tactile language ("bones chimed," "brass light pooled like thin honey").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—the tarot card's map narrows options to the bone-pit, forcing the barter choice. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of personal history ("scattered the last of my grandmother's stories"). One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through recurring images (ash, roots, hush) that reconfigure meaning at closure. The non-literal answer—growth through borrowed meaning—resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the boy pressing his forehead to the card.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with rhythmic prose that mirrors emotional intensity ("foolishness had learned how to hold its breath"). POV remains stable and deeply filtered through the protagonist's perception. Elision (e.g., Weaver's cryptic rules) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Minor repetition in peak beats ("inlaying meaning" appears twice) prevents a higher score, but figurative language remains coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines through fresh synthesis of concepts (bartered fates, listening seeds) grounded in specific, lived detail. The core premise transforms familiar tropes via unique voice and world logic. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
