<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in professional identity, with embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., handling the humming needle). The caretaker applies secondary pressure, and the final choice to ground spirits rather than banish them is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the tide accepted the shape of the shore").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where unrest becomes "choosing to stay" with felt cost ("each released a last sip of storm"). Orientation is clear by line 2; the net's unraveling drives a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice (e.g., the net's knots hold pockets of breath, the prismatic light braids into mask cracks). The sanctuary functions as a micro-setting that pressures tactics and charges the final image with the locket-as-hearth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—unraveling knots sequentially intensifies pressure, narrowing options until spirits are grounded. Cost is legible in the "last sip of storm" and the tide's pause, altering the stakes irreversibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of grounding versus banishment emerges through concrete action and image (e.g., needle accumulating silence, net holding breath). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "my work was never to banish, only to ground restless spirits kindly."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("patient rainbows," "hush of constellations"). Diction remains within the restorer's lexicon; elision (e.g., "time moved strangely") is taught and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("waves softened as if they had waited years to stop pretending they were teeth"). Minor register elevation in peak beats ("lucid unrest") is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mythic and tactile elements (e.g., tapestry needle, fisher masks) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the core concept of "interlaced hush" is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
