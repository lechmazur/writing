<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in micro-choices like pressing the sea glass into their palm. The motivation to protect the "tender hush" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the final act of writing and stacking stones. The skipper, while secondary, applies warm, observant pressure that feels specific. A minor deduction for the skipper's trait being more told than shown in his on-page moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of stones and sea glass, which reweights the anonymous chain's purpose with palpable cost: "the ache that shines enough to guide." The orientation is immediate, and the pattern of letters and stones creates a coherent, escalating pressure toward this final, legible image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is a micro-setting that actively pressures choice (lighting a candle, finding sea glass) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the keeper's perception, such as "wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath." The environment is inextricable from the conflict and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift: the lamp dying mid-storm intensifies the dominant stake of maintaining safety, forcing the keeper's agency to write ("We are still here") and build stones. The cost is legible in the image of "five stones for love, and one small shell for the keeper who never arrives," a forfeiture that deepens the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept: safety as a communal, anonymous act, "bottled" and passed hand to hand. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Safety is not the absence of loss; it is the ache that shines enough to guide." This conceptual repricing avoids moralizing and grows from the particulars of the letter chain and stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature, with a controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure ("Tonight the lamp gave up mid-storm"). POV is stable and deeply fused with the keeper's consciousness. The sparse dialogue with the skipper is natural and carries significant subtext in its brevity ("They are, I said").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the peak beat: "the ghosts clung to the edges like salt" risks mixing metaphors (ghosts/salt) slightly, though it does not obscure closure. This prevents a 9+ score but remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper, an anonymous letter chain, and stone-stacking as communication feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious emotional calculus about communal safety. The risk of a quiet, accumulative structure pays off with a potent closure image.</comment>
