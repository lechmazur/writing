<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete micro-choices, such as forgiving a demurrage for a choir, which reveals her hierarchy of values. Her cautious exuberance is embodied and credible, balancing her shrewd professionalism with a desire for communal repair. The final choice to share the ledger key with Jun feels earned by their collaborative investigation and shared weight of the project.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the promise to keep listening, reconfiguring the harbor's social fabric with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through patterns of compassion. A minor deduction for the coincidental arrival of the locket, which functions as the inciting incident but is not causally motivated by character action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The library under stars is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices, supplying the space and resources for the Ledger. The locket, a recurring object, charges the final image by becoming an emblem on the desk. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through professional POV, such as cargo that "sings when lifted properly."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, as Mara and Jun's investigation deepens the stake of recognition. The cost is legible in the folded notes and shared key, foreclosing the path of secrecy. A single meaningful tightening—finding Hideo's name—narrows options and charges the final communal gathering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and the recurring image of tides and music, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "kindness circling back like returning tide," reweighting the premise of silent contribution. The locket's story and the Harbor Ledger serve as concrete particulars that ground the abstract concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that uses maritime idiom consistently. The prose has a distinct texture, with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression, such as "pages breathe calmer when trumpets are sleeping." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext that advances the plot and distinguishes character voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with vivid, purposeful imagery and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the metaphor "snapping open like sails" slightly strains coherence in its vehicle. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of maritime brokerage and library science feels fresh and inevitable, with specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The core concept of cycles of compassion is transformed through lived detail, such as Hideo tuning the pier's wind. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
