<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marek’s characterization is superb, with his "logically emotional" trait driving his unique tactical choice of sonic absolution over force. His final choice to offer the key is earned by his established method and her revealed backstory, creating a resonant reconfiguration. The seeker’s shift is equally well-motivated, her hunger "shift[ing] shape" through the stone's sound, not authorial fiat. A hairline deduction for a slight summary feel in her village's history, but the embodied micro-choices under pressure are flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through sensory density and a cadence shift into the resonant sound. Closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the two characters align around the stone's mercy, with cost legible in her smile that "did not hide its ache." The structure is taught and purposeful, with the seeker's arrival serving as the single meaningful intensification that reweights the stake from protection to shared stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in economy and function. The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are not just backdrop; they actively pressure choices ("ice floes nudged the pilings") and charge the final image ("the sea accepted the night like a vow"). The Throat of Tides is the ultimate micro-setting, constraining every tactical choice and defining the closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through Marek's professional, poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, powerful cadence shift: the introduction of the sonic chord that reconfigures the seeker's desire. The dominant stake of protection is clear from the start and meaningfully deepens into co-stewardship. The cost is felt on the page in her relinquished hunger and acknowledged ache. Protagonist agency drives the turn through Marek's deliberate choice to "let the sound breathe toward her."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central concept of "sonic absolution"—forgiveness through alignment, not erasure. This is explored with profound specificity via the stone's mechanics and the characters' choices, resisting any tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to handle power and grief, reweighting prior material without a hint of statement or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("windows were freckles of dying light"). POV is stable and deeply embodied. The single dialogue exchange is natural, goal-driven, and rich with subtext. Purposeful compression ("a tune too brave for the weather") and patterned diction ("fleshly ethereal") are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential overwriting in "fleshly ethereal hush," which slightly strains logic, but it is pattern-taught and reprises effectively. Otherwise, the language is precise, propulsive, and devoid of loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle, especially in the critical closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse, a sonic artifact, and a conflict resolved through vibrational empathy is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded mechanics. The quiet, earned stasis of the ending is a bold risk that pays off, heightening stakes and coherence without a hint of gimmickry or derivation.</comment>
