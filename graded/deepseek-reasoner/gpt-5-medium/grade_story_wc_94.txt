<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("thinning fear into a clarity that did not soften its edge"). The final choice to "measure how long their courage would echo" is earned by prior causality and the alignment of personal and civic scars, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise). The final image of the city as a "healed page drying" reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is tight, with the letter, timer, and storm all converging to force a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory and storm function as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("storm-kissed wonder, each thunderclap a bell"), filtered through the poet's perception and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the timer's ticking and the storm's approach creating coherent pressure that culminates in the decisive act of tracing the constellation. The cost is legible in the final, measured silence and the alignment of scars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cartography of scars, refusing tidy morals and culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image reweights prior material without statement, offering a vision of painful but navigable healing through specific, earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a poet's lens ("page turned in a night-blooming atlas"). The dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot with natural, goal-driven economy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor paraphrase loop ("furiously tranquil" repeated) is the only hairline slip, but it serves a clear pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a censored poet, a storm-lit observatory, and a cartography of scars feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high originality, transforming its elements through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
