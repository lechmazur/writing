<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the names waiting in marble sounded like waves learning to rest"). The final choice to carve the kite in a "single spare curve" is earned by the spectral mentorship and the father's presence, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost. The "fiercely meditative" trait is dramatized through micro-choices like offering the ribbon, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the final image of the carved kite, landing with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The lens holds as pressure accumulates through sensory density and pattern (ribbon, butterflies, mother's hush) until the final cadence shift. The cost is legible in the image of the "single spare curve," a reconfiguration of the protagonist's meditative certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is indispensable, pressuring choices by accepting each chisel tap "as a measured tide" and steering the carver from "too much ornament." It constrains the final image, its "cracked roof" and "condensation planets" charging the closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the carver's professional POV ("glass ribs singing like tide").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening when the father arrives and chooses a poem notch, forcing a trade-off between ornament and silence. The cost is unmistakable as the carver sets letters "shallow at first, then deeper when his hand steadied," a visible price paid. The spectral mentorship and butterfly migration cohere as pressure that reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief through the final image of the kite, reweighting prior material (ribbon, poems, migration) without moralizing. Theme emerges from particulars—the ribbon's notches, the greenhouse's calm—integrating fully with character struggle. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, like the father standing by the lettuce beds for steadiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("a thundering calm," "butterflies tested the cracked roof"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the daughter's death) is taught early and pays off in the father's choice of her poem. POV is stable and apt, with diction within the carver's plausible lexicon. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("glass ribs singing like tide," "butterflies... a drifting congregation"). Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel," but clarity at closure is unharmed. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief, craft, and nature feels inevitable. The combination of gravestone carving and butterfly migration is organic and heightens stakes. Risk-taking in spectral mentorship and lyric compression coheres without gimmickry. The final image transforms familiar material through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
