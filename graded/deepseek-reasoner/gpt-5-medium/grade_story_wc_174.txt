<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("my hands felt suddenly like tools for theft"). The final stance of following rather than leading is earned through the dramatized realization and the woman's arrival. The "uncommonly serene" trait is more descriptive than constraining, slightly limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through reflective density and the arrival of the woman, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost ("I felt uncommonly serene not because I had led, but because I had finally learned how to follow"). The lens holds firmly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is a vivid, atmospheric setting that charges the final image. The "meteor hush" and echoing floor are purposefully sensory. It functions more as a charged backdrop than a constraint on choice, preventing a 9+ score, but its integration is exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's reflective agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening from ethical doubt to a concrete promise and new method. The cost is legible in the protagonist's relinquishment of control and the shift to collaborative creation. A single, meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling emerges organically from the conflict and is resolved not with a moral but through the resonant, non-literal image of the puppets cutting their threads and writing. The final reconfiguration offers a profound answer to the central question without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke"). The elision of direct dialogue is purposeful and taught, serving the story's reflective, accumulative mode. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. There is no scaffold or loopiness. A very slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like smoke that forgot its fire") prevents a higher score, but clarity is never obscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a calligrapher's guilt, subversive puppetry, and a campfire story stick as a ethical mechanism is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in character and concept avoid tropes and create a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
