<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The father's backstory is anchored in the present via the bitting gauge and tilts stance. The final choice to light the lighthouse and "root" its beam is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mother's illness and the protagonist's determination to mend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through image patterns (light, mending, patience) to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The final image of watering "alleys with light" reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 4 ("fire escape gardener," "street," "harbor").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused and constrains choices: the lighthouse gate's salt-bitten hinges, the skiff "that believes in mending," and the bitting gauge as a tool-as-setting all pressure tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the gardener's expertise (e.g., "oil skin sticky, the glass filmed with a decade of grief").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (personal redemption through light) escalates via cadence shifts under the Accumulative lens: the "quivering hush" intensifies, the lock's surrender is a quiet turn, and the lantern's ignition deepens the stake. Agency is endurance and attention, foreclosing the path of passive waiting with cost felt in the rowing effort and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as strength, mending as act of hope) emerges through particulars—the patched skiff, the lockpicking, the beam cut into "slips"—without statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer to loss through light as a rooted, kind habit. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends horticultural and lockmaster lexicons ("feeling which ridges wanted relief"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating in rowing beats and breathing in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("architecture" of vulnerability echoes "fire escape gardener") and coherent. Rhythm is controlled, e.g., "steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of gardening, lockpicking, and lighthouse keeping feels inevitable. Specificity (e.g., "lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth") avoids quirkiness by integrating into character and conflict. Risk-taking with lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
