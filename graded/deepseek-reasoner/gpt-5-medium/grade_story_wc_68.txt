<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in "rationally rebellious" philosophy, and intensifies under pressure. Embodied emotion ("old ache rise from my throat to my skull") and micro-choice to act rather than lie reveal character. Final choice to use the cog to fix the gate is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered details (silt, chalk marks) culminating in a decisive change (fixing the gate) with clear cost ("pressure kissed our shins"). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the old method "stood up in a new century," proving the protagonist's philosophy. Orientation is immediate and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring every choice. The sewer, silt, and drowned library are tactile and constrain action. The cog and chalk marks are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's philosophical lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (competing narratives) and escalate coherently under the accumulative lens through the silt crisis. The protagonist's agency in using the cog to solve the immediate, life-threatening problem forces a trade-off and proves his method, reweighting the narrative stakes with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of practical preservation vs. dogma emerges organically from events and the final image. The cog's use provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates powerfully in the final lines, reconfiguring the meaning of rebellion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and consistent, a "abrasive calm" filtered through a philosophical mind. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, reflecting the POV's state. Perceptual signature is unique and sustained under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density. Minor rhythmic lapses in a few complex sentences slightly slow momentum, but clarity is never obscured. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("a tooth from time itself"). No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, philosophical protagonist, and a cog as a central symbol is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of competing narratives is transformed through specific, grounded choices and a non-obvious resolution that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
