<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with embodied emotion ("kneeled to the past without kneeling to despair"). Micro-choices under pressure (searching graffiti, entering river) reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation ("I would stop asking it to be me") is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Slight risk of over-articulated insight at peak, but contradiction acts in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: graffiti clues accumulate pressure toward closure. Orientation anchors (station, river, brother's death) clear by ¶2. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible at "water took the number and returned a different one." Persistent constraint of past failure shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (graffiti as map, river as destination) and charges final image ("margin with a stick"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ivy "shimmered like soundproofing"). Station evolves from ruin to ledger, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting (accordion, graffiti) functions as crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) escalates through accumulative deepening via graffiti clues. Protagonist agency drives each step (copying coordinates, entering river). Cost is unmistakable at river encounter: "honest about its weight and mine." Coincidence-free; pressure coheres under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (accordion, graffiti, river) without statement. Ending offers non-literal answer: river as "muscle of earth" reweights prior certainty. Subtext in graffiti ("Begin again") and final image. Avoids moralizing; complexity in brother's sacrifice and protagonist's flawed professionalism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("green chapel, pews of nettle"). POV stable and voice-consistent. Purposeful compression ("storm drunk with certainty") taught early. Diction reflects character expertise without register drift. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with propulsion ("I lay down by the gate... breathed until our rhythms met"). Figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops or artifacts. Sentence rhythm varies with emotional intensity. Minor risk of density in climax, but clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, grief, and graffiti as oracle. Premise transformed through specific detail (patched accordion, survey sheets). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Inevitable in hindsight; closure depends on exact elements. No derivative echoes.</comment>
