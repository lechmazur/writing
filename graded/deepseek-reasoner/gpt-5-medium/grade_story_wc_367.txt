<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete ("shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") and dramatized through micro-choices like feeding the storm names and teaching the child. Interiority is rich and character-specific, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance is earned, with the cost of isolation and responsibility felt on the page. A hairline deduction for a minor register drift in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the trio—narrator, child, storm—crystallize into a "newsroom of two," redefining guidance with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building density through recurring images. The final image of "weathered joy" charges prior material. Cost is legible in the enduring, cyclical labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Its glass bones, prisms, and lantern wick are tactile and purpose-driven. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("green coolness," "breathing optics"). The setting evolves from a solitary post to a shared newsroom, actively shaping the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates accumulatively through the storm's arrival and the child's discovery, deepening the stake of providing guidance. The protagonist's agency is clear in feeding the storm and teaching the child. Cost is legible in the enduring, cyclical labor. A minor deduction for the child's arrival relying on a prophetic declaration, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of obsolete print media and luminous, oral tradition. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: guidance is now "published in beams." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like feeding the storm names of the vanished past. Resists moralizing, embracing complexity through the storm's ambiguous laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic, prophetic voice that modulates under pressure. Diction is consistently inventive ("a bell made of dawn," "drone barges"). The child's internal voice remains coherent and distinct through her drawings and observations. Elision is purposeful and taught early, paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though it approaches density limits in high-pressure beats ("laughter feels like ballast"). No loops or scaffolding. A minor deduction for a near-mixed metaphor ("laughter feels like ballast... weighted joy").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-media lighthouse keeper, a prophetic storm, and a child who speaks headlines is singular and transformative. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A fully integrated, authentic artistic vision.</comment>
