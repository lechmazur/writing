<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lida's characterization is exceptionally concrete and embodied, with her telepathy rooted in "shrapnel and sap." Her final choice to unseal the embryo is a high-stakes micro-decision earned by prior causality, revealing a clear hierarchy of values against "implanted destiny." Her internal conflict between evolving and preserving tradition is dramatized, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the seedling's growth and the council's stunned arrival) with a visible, felt cost (her defiance and the permanent alteration of the valley). The causal lens holds firmly: her rejection of the council's refusal directly leads to her unsealing the embryo. The kite's discovery is the only minor coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are not a postcard setting but a crucible that pressures choice, housing the vault and providing the "mirror of fire water" for the unsealing. The embryo in amber is a recurring object that charges the final image as it opens "like a wet book." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Lida's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lida's agency under the causal lens: her failed persuasion of the council forces her to act alone, a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of collective agreement. The cost of her defiance is legible in the council's arrival "to argue" and the irreversible change she has wrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of evolving tradition versus implanted destiny is integrated flawlessly through event and image, not statement. The final image of the "seedling kept listening, learning us, letting us learn it, without nails" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends grandmotherly insight with insurgent strategy. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture, and the elision of how she bypasses the pulse lock is purposeful, taught by the ivy's guidance and paid off by the act itself. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact occurs in the phrase "the mince of syllables slide through cattail and scarlet moss," where the mixed metaphor of "mince" slightly muddles the otherwise clear image of plant communication. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, and a bio-engineered embryo is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "implanted destiny" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, committing fully to its implications without retreat. A bold, singular artistic stance.</comment>
