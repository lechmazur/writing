<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to teach dust is clear and intensifies, compelling the choice to engage with the broadcast. Embodied emotion is strong ("tapping pencil on the shelf, establishing common time in smolder"). However, the final endurance feels slightly more thematic than causally earned from prior micro-choices, lacking a visible cost on the page for the promise made.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the dust becomes "fluent," the radio sleeps, and the protagonist internalizes the cadence marker. The cost is legible in the final image of the protagonist sleeping but "keep[ing] time," a quiet endurance. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove and shortwave radio are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable the protagonist's choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's profession and goal ("numbered rests," "onionskin, barlines as narrow as spider threads"). The setting evolves from burned bones to a space of secret luminosity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift driven by the protagonist's agency in tuning the radio and engaging with the broadcast. The stake—teaching dust to tell stories—is signaled early and meaningfully deepens. The cost of the promise to "carry tempo forward" is felt, charging the final image of earned stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of music, silence, and storytelling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "dust kept telling, now fluent, now shy, but always breathing measure." Subtext is rich in gesture and image, avoiding moralizing. The core concept of scoring silence is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, musical signature. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with intensity. Purposeful compression and elision ("translated by a wary hallway") are taught and paid off. The internal texture remains coherent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a few phrases risk slight over-densification ("Needle-snow fell from the rafters, and the radio hissed like a teapot"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-catastrophe setting, a musical copyist, and a pirate broadcast scoring silence is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The concept is committed to fully, with specific, grounded choices in world logic and character. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
