<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("I brush ash from my hair and feel taller"). The final choice to build new monuments is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost of altered purpose. Contradictory impulses act in scene through the tension between sorting seeds (arranging tomorrows) and reading leaves (hearing the past's expectations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's understanding of their role is decisively altered, with cost legible in the final image of descending "newly arranged." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with meaning built through pattern recognition and density increase. The orientation is clear within the first 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("roots braided into cloud, its bark ash-gray"). The environment is fully integrated into action and thought, with the micro-setting of the monuments directly shaping the protagonist's tactics and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the decoded phrase forcing a higher-stakes choice to build new monuments. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the physical and mental transformation felt by the protagonist. A single meaningful deepening shifts options and knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory and transformation through the final realization that "what emerges transformed always is the hearer." Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The core concept of folklore is fully integrated into the protagonist's actions and the story's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional, with a consistent, voice-motivated POV. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and syntax that reflects the character's mind and state. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative density appears in some high-pressure beats ("drifting in spirals, stippling the air with faded green, bronze, and ash-white") but does not obscure clarity or closure. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mythic and ecological elements that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of seed sorting, leaf reading, and monument building is organic and highly specific. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring coherence.</comment>
