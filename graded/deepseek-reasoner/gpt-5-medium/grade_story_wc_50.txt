<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, revealed through his trade and perception ("peripherally focused," "cupped the device and listened to its wrongness"). His motivation to "store wonder" is dramatized through his meticulous actions, and his final choice to leave the timer behind is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with a quiet, felt cost. A minor deduction for a slight abstraction in his core desire, which is more told than shown in a single line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as he leaves the timer, a choice that reconfigures his relationship with wonder and time. The cost is legible on the page in the image of the cavern keeping his laugh. Causality is tight, with each beat of mapping and testing building toward the final, purposeful harvest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling his choices throughout. It functions as a micro-setting, its specific properties ("reflection angles," "hollow behind a veined column") directly shaping his tactics and the story's outcome. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening process of mapping and testing the echoes. The dominant stake (harvesting wonder) is clear, and the cost of his endeavor is felt in his isolation and the tangible result of the humming jars. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient and effectively executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and the locksmith's actions, exploring the agreement between patience, pressure, and preservation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this theme through the final image of the stored jars, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The integration of concept and character is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a locksmith's "reflective" and technical lens. The voice is consistently lyrical yet precise, with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the action. The prose's distinct texture is a primary strength, fully serving the story's accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "exhaled a hush like cooled iron") that slightly slows momentum, but it is largely voice-motivated and does not obscure causality or the closure image. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of harvesting echoes is a singular, ingenious synthesis of concept and character. The story commits fully to its unique logic, and the specific details of the locksmith's trade and the cavern's acoustics feel fresh and inevitable. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode pays off with high stakes and clarity.</comment>
