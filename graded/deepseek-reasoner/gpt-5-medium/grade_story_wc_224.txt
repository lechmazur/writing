<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV's buried shame over accent and refusal to sing is concretely embodied via feather barbs and stone vision. Final choice to seed tongue with old consonants feels earned by the on-page cost of silence. Contradictory impulses (wanting home vs. burying voice) act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (shelves, muttering, substitution) escalates to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's reclaimed voice reconfigures the mountain's geography. Cost is legible in the moved shame-encyclopedias and the door sized for voice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-as-mountain is indispensable, constraining movement ("aisles curled into cul-de-sacs") and charging the final image ("aisles aligned into a corridor shaped like a question mark"). Sensory detail is purposefully selective and POV-filtered ("books smelled like old rivers and flint").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density of pattern (shelf-lamps, muttered dictionaries, exhaling floor) until the seer's test forces a stance crystallization. The cost of buried talents is made visceral and alters tactics (moving the encyclopedias).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of home as a practice of voice emerges entirely through image and action (courtyard of jars, house made of vowels). The final, non-literal answer—"home was not a dwelling but a practice"—reweights the entire journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, rhythmic prose ("a labyrinth of shelves breathing in the high cold"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the boy's brief appearance) is taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice is consistently poetic yet grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("hidden thunder"). Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with scene needs, from long, labyrinthine lines to short, potent declarations ("Touch it").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singular synthesis of concept (buried voice), setting (sentient bookstore-mountain), and stakes. The mercury-glass seer and her methods feel wholly original and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
