<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in their identity as a sculptor; embodied emotion is specific and avoids diagnostic speech. The final choice to build the gate is earned by prior causality and the cartographer's teachings, with a visible cost in the storm's turn and the dawn's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the gate reconfigures the meaning of passage with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; the lantern slide's mechanics, while slightly abstract, are taught and pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. The archway and storm supply resources and pressure; sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action. The archway itself becomes a crucible for the protagonist's work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; the storm provides coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the protagonist's physical work and the storm's unspooling. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action and image; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of passage and alliance without moralizing. The final image of the gate reweights prior material with profound ambiguity and complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic mastery. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the POV's plausible, poetic lexicon throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught. A minor rhythm stumble occurs in "timewoven alliances, the cartographer called them," which feels slightly expository, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original and specific synthesis of ideas feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of nautical salvage, magic realism, and woodcraft is organic and bold. Risk-taking with the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
