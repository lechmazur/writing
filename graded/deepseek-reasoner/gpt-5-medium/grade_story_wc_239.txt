<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied interiority ("My dictionary cracked softly"). The final shift from "witness" to "hinge" is a credible renunciation earned by the walk. A slight diagnostic air in the final realizations prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist's role is redefined, with cost felt in the final image of the world inhaling. The disorienting opening is functional and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in micro-setting. The library, lectern, and dictionary are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive cadence shift and deepening as the walk reweights the protagonist's understanding of their task. The cost of this reconfiguration is legible, though the pressure feels more internal than externally coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from image and event, resisting statement for resonant implication. The final line offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. The integration of listening and space is particular and profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. Purposeful compression and lyrical patterning are taught early and paid off at closure. The elision is masterful and serves the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting ("wanderingly exact" feels slightly precious), but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure. No loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of concept and voice. The premise of a "spiral arbitration" is fresh and fully committed to, transformed through specific, grounded detail and a profound emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
