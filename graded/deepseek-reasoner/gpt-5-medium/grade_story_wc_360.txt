<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motive ("mathematics of emotion") is concrete and drives all choices; embodied emotion in "feels his terror as arithmetic" avoids diagnostic speak; micro-choices under pressure (borrowing Maris, setting type for couple) reveal hierarchy of values; final renunciation of ambiguity earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break at "I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself" reweights stakes with cost; closure is Conceptual Repricing where editing sky's grief reconfigures meaning; orientation anchors (workshop, operator role) established early; halo fragment's cooling at confession proves cost on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Topaz workshop and halo fragment constrain choices (e.g., fragment hums/brightens during key actions); sensory detail ("oil, citrus, topaz dust") is selective and POV-filtered; observatory's "sleepy lid" mirrors internal state; final image of "vanished light" charges closure with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: couple's arrival deepens stake ("help them forgive"), leading to confession beat that narrows options; cost legible in "distance between cruelty and mercy in points and picas"; accumulative intensification through density of image/idea repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "transposed empathy" emerges through concrete actions (printing for couple) rather than statement; final question ("Will the sky forgive me") offers non-literal resonance; subtext in "rotating mirror" image; avoids moralizing while embracing complexity of forgiveness and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("lock the chase and ink the forme"); POV stable and voice-consistent; deliberate elision (e.g., "saint or astronaut") taught early and paid off; diction remains within operator's lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught; slight register drift in "transposed empathy" term (-0.3) but clarified by context; propulsion maintained through varied sentence lengths and concrete actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress mechanics with emotional mathematics; halo fragment concept transforms familiar tropes; risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes; closure image feels inevitable yet fresh; specificity in "points and picas" measurement irreplaceable.</comment>
