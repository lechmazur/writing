<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through mineral leaves and copper wire. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in the laying down of the diary. Contradictory impulses of hunger and calm act simultaneously throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the final image of silence as trust. The pattern of listening and grafting deepens to a decisive communal shift. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and copper wire are indispensable micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, with the orchard's breathing shifting as a direct result of the caretaker's work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the cost of failing health legible in the afternoons of tiredness. The dominant stake of fostering respect tightens through the formation of a council and agreed-upon rules, culminating in the final, decisive copper circle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy through the final image of the "woven map." Theme emerges organically from the particulars of grafting and listening, resisting moralizing. The conceptual repricing of silence as trust is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with a lyrical, systematic rhythm that modulates beautifully under pressure ("an insect choir corrected by the living stone"). POV is stable and apt, with purposeful compression and elision that serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("laughter and suspicion," "sentences of labor"). Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally to match scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of terminal illness, interspecies communication, and living architecture feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
