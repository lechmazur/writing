<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's visceral reaction to dishonesty ("I wilt near dishonesty") is consistently embodied and drives key choices. The final stance crystallization—refusing to gild lies—is earned through prior causality with visible cost when the city dims. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of withheld truths intensifies to a cadence shift (city's collective murmur) that forces the hatch reopening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where truth becomes a shared resource, with cost felt in the dimming greenhouses and the postmaster's trembling hands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is a crucible: the greenhouse city's toxic sky and fragile glass pressure choices (leaf-post vs. archives). The zinc gutter system constrains the climax—it literally holds the lost conversations. Sensory detail is purposefully selective (tin-stained fingers, condensate beads) and mirrors internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the refusal to gild lies initiates a city-wide withholding of anecdotes, forcing the confrontation. Cost is legible in the "dry as parchment" days and the gathered weight of murmured truths. One meaningful tightening (the notice) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of candor versus control emerges through concrete particulars—the wilt near dishonesty, the jars of confessions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: survival measured in truths. The "Pluviary of Spoken Things" reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the calligrapher's voice filters the world through texture and truth-value ("moved tasted like mildew"). Purposeful compression ("mercy here was always thirsty for consent") heightens pressure. No head-hopping; POV stability maintains intense focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-rich ("breathes like a frightened lung"). Rhythm accelerates with crisis ("My body wilted near his dishonesty") and breathes in resolution. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bioclimatic dystopia and archival metaphor feels inevitable. The concept of lost conversations physically stored in jars is a non-obvious risk that heightens stakes. Specificity (zinc-etched plates, citronella sprigs) avoids generic ornamentation.</comment>
