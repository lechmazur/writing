<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet's interiority is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the colonnade, and the collective "we" POV shows credible micro-choices under pressure. The poet's final choice to step onto the ice is earned by their established longing to "stride through boundaries," with visible cost in the guard's emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where shared breath harmonizes with the colonnade, reconfiguring fear into collective courage. Cost is legible in the guard's tears and discarded badge, proving the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade and frozen lake are indispensable, actively constraining choices (tuning to the poet's pulse, cracking as the group harmonizes) and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective and woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the shared breath that bends the colonnade and cracks the lake. Cost is unmistakable in the guard's transformation and the palpable shift from fear to "fertile" certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "dissolving boundaries," with the poet's rephrasing of the decree serving as a non-literal answer to the central question of fear versus meaning. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the discarded badge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control, though some figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "tiny trustworthy earthquakes") slightly risks clarity. POV is stable and voice consistently lyrical, with elision taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Masterful prose with high information density and clear propulsion, but minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "lantern-moth hush" reappearing) triggers a slight deduction. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in synthesizing post-censorship renewal with ecological metaphor. The premise feels inevitable and risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, particularly in the poet's transformative paraphrasing of law.</comment>
